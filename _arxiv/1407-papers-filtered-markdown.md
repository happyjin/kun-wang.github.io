**1.    Suppressing correlated noise in signals transmitted over the Gaussian memory channels using $2N$-port splitter and phase flips**  
Ke-Xia Jiang, Shi-Quan Zhang, San-Min Ke, Heng Fan  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 052320 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0653  
<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme for suppressing the correlated noise in signals transmitted over the bosonic Gaussian memory channels is proposed. This is a compromise solution rather than removing the noise completely. The scheme is based on linear optical elements, two $N$-port splitters and $N$ number of phase flips. The proposed scheme has the advantages that the correlated noise of the memory channels are greatly suppressed, and the input signal states can be protected excellently when transmitting over the noise channels. We examine the suppressing efficiency of the scheme for the correlated noise, both from quantum information of the states directly transmitted through the noise channel and also from the entanglement teleportation. The phase flips are very important aspects for the suppressions of the correlated noise, which transform the roles of the memory factor from completely negative to positive in quantum information communications. Increasing the number of beam splitters also can improve the suppressing efficiency of the scheme in communications.

**2.    Qubit state transfer via one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk**  
?. Yal??nkaya, Z. Gedik  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0689  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for perfect transfer of an arbitrary qubit state via discrete-time quantum walk on a line or a circle. For this purpose, we take the advantage of one more coin operator which is applied at the end of the walk. This additional coin operator does not depend on the state to be transferred. We show that perfect state transfer over arbitrary distances can be achieved only for identity and flip coin operators. Perfect state transfer can also be realized by using an unbiased coin operator but only for a finite number of distances.

**3.    Generalized open quantum walks on Apollonian networks**  
?. Pawela, P. Gawron, J.A. Miszczak, P. Sadowski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1184  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the model of generalized open quantum walks on networks using the Transition Operation Matrices formalism. We focus our analysis on the mean first passage time and the average return time in Apollonian networks. These results differ significantly from a classical walk on these networks. We show a comparison of the classical and quantum behaviour of walks on these networks.

**4.    Converting one photon into two via four-wave mixing in optical fibers**  
Audrey Dot, Evan Meyer-Scott, Raja Ahmad, Martin Rochette, Thomas Jennewein  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 043808 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1250  
<blockquote>
<p>
Observing nonlinear optical quantum effects or implementing quantum information protocols using nonlinear optics requires moving to ever-smaller input light intensities. However, low light intensities generally mean weak optical nonlinearities, inadequate for many applications. Here we calculate the performance of four-wave mixing in various optical fibers for the case where one of the input beams is a single photon. We show that in tapered chalcogenide glass fibers (microwires) a single photon plus strong pump beam can produce a pair of photons with probability 0.1%, much higher than in previous work on bulk and waveguided crystal sources. Such a photon converter could be useful for creating large entangled photon states, for performing a loophole-free test of Bell's inequalities, and for quantum communication.

**5.    Waveguide-QED-based measurement of a reservoir spectral density**  
Francesco Ciccarello  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2182  
<blockquote>
<p>
The spectral density (SD) function has a central role in the study of open quantum systems (OQSs). We discover a method allowing for a "static" measurement of the SD - i.e., it requires neither the OQS to be initially excited nor its time evolution tracked in time - which is not limited to the weak-coupling regime. This is achieved through one-dimensional photon scattering for a zero-temperature reservoir coupled to the OQS via the rotating wave approximation. We find that the SD profile is a universal simple function of the photon's reflectance and transmittance. As such, it can be straightforwardly inferred from photon's reflection and transmission spectra.

**6.    Environment-induced mixing processes in quantum walks**  
Lauri Lehman  
Int. J. Quantum Inform. 12 (4), 1450021 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2470  
<blockquote>
<p>
The mixing process of discrete-time quantum walks on one-dimensional lattices is revisited in a setting where the walker is coupled to an environment, and the time evolution of the walker and the environment is unitary. The mixing process is found to be incomplete, in the sense that the walker does not approach the maximally mixed state indefinitely, but the distance to the maximally mixed state saturates to some finite value depending on the size of the environment. The quantum speedup of mixing time is investigated numerically as the size of the environment decreases from infinity to a finite value. The mixing process in this unitary setting can be explained by interpreting it as an equilibration process in a closed quantum system, where subsystems can exhibit equilibration even when the entropy of the total system remains zero.

**7.    Quantum-enhanced deliberation of learning agents using trapped ions**  
Vedran Dunjko, Nicolai Friis, Hans J. Briegel  
New J. Phys. 17, 023006 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2830  
<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme that successfully employs quantum mechanics in the design of autonomous learning agents has recently been reported in the context of the projective simulation (PS) model for artificial intelligence. In that approach, the key feature of a PS agent, a specific type of memory which is explored via random walks, was shown to be amenable to quantization. In particular, classical random walks were substituted by Szegedy-type quantum walks, allowing for a speed-up. In this work we propose how such classical and quantum agents can be implemented in systems of trapped ions. We employ a generic construction by which the classical agents are `upgraded' to their quantum counterparts by nested coherent controlization, and we outline how this construction can be realized in ion traps. Our results provide a flexible modular architecture for the design of PS agents. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations of simple PS agents which analyze the robustness of our proposal under certain noise models.

**8.    A case study in programming a quantum annealer for hard operational planning problems**  
Eleanor G. Rieffel, Davide Venturelli, Bryan O'Gorman, Minh B. Do, Elicia Prystay, Vadim N. Smelyanskiy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2887  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a case study in programming an early quantum annealer to attack optimization problems related to operational planning. While a number of studies have looked at the performance of quantum annealers on problems native to their architecture, and others have examined performance of select problems stemming from an application area, ours is one of the first studies of a quantum annealer's performance on parametrized families of hard problems from a practical domain. We explore two different general mappings of planning problems to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, and apply them to two parametrized families of planning problems, navigation-type and scheduling-type. We also examine two more compact, but problem-type specific, mappings to QUBO, one for the navigation-type planning problems and one for the scheduling-type planning problems. We study embedding properties and parameter setting, and examine their effect on the efficiency with which the quantum annealer solves these problems. From these results we derive insights useful for the programming and design of future quantum annealers: problem choice, the mapping used, the properties of the embedding, and the annealing profile all matter, each significantly affecting the performance.

**9.    Optoelectromechanical transducer: reversible conversion between microwave and optical photons**  
Lin Tian  
Ann. Phys. (Berlin) 527, 1 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3035  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum states encoded in microwave photons or qubits can be effectively manipulated, whereas optical photons can be coherently transferred via optical fibre and waveguide. The reversible conversion of quantum states between microwave and optical photons will hence enable the distribution of quantum information over long distance and significantly improve the scalability of hybrid quantum systems. Owning to technological advances, mechanical resonators couple to quantum devices in distinctly different spectral range with tunable coupling, and can serve as a powerful interface to connect those devices. In this review, we summarize recent theory and experimental progress in the coherent conversion between microwave and optical fields via optoelectromechanical transducers. The challenges and perspectives in achieving single-photon-level quantum state conversion will also be discussed.

**10.    Storage of up-converted telecom photons in a doped crystal**  
Nicolas Maring, Kutlu Kutluer, Joachim Cohen, Matteo Cristiani, Margherita Mazzera, Patrick M. Ledingham, Hugues de Riedmatten  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3094  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on an experiment that demonstrates the frequency up-conversion of telecommunication wavelength single-photon-level pulses to be resonant with a $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$:$\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{Si}\mathrm{O}_5$ crystal. We convert the telecom photons at $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$ to $606\,\mathrm{nm}$ using a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate nonlinear waveguide. The maximum device efficiency (which includes all optical loss) is inferred to be $\eta_{\mathrm{dev}}^{\mathrm{max}} = 22 \pm 1\,%$ (internal efficiency $\eta_{\mathrm{int}} = 75\pm8\,%$) with a signal to noise ratio exceeding 1 for single-photon-level pulses with durations of up to 560$\,$ns. The converted light is then stored in the crystal using the atomic frequency comb scheme with storage and retrieval efficiencies exceeding $\eta_{\mathrm{AFC}} = 20\,%$ for predetermined storage times of up to $5\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. The retrieved light is time delayed from the noisy conversion process allowing us to measure a signal to noise ratio exceeding 100 with telecom single-photon-level inputs. These results represent the first demonstration of single-photon-level optical storage interfaced with frequency up-conversion.

**11.    The Asymptotic Cooling of Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling**  
Sadegh Raeisi, Michele Mosca  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 100404 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3232  
<blockquote>
<p>
The purity of quantum states is a key requirement for many quantum applications. Improving the purity is limited by fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Here we are probing the fundamental limits for a natural approach to this problem, namely heat-bath algorithmic cooling(HBAC). The existence of the cooling limit for HBAC techniques was proved by Schulman et al. in, the limit however remained unknown for the past decade. Here for the first time we find this limit. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, this corresponds to the maximum extractable work from the quantum system.

**12.    Resonator-Assisted Quantum Bath Engineering of a Flux Qubit**  
Xian-Peng Zhang, Li-Tuo Shen, Zhang-Qi Yin, Huai-Zhi Wu, Zhen-Biao Yang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3337  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate quantum bath engineering for preparation of any orbital state with controllable phase factor of a superconducting flux qubit assisted by a microwave coplanar waveguide resonator. We investigate the polarization efficiency of the arbitrary direction rotating on the Bloch sphere, and obtain an effective Rabi frequency by using the convergence condition of Markovian master equation. The processes of polarization can be implemented effectively in a dissipative environment created by resonator photon loss when the spectrum of the microwave resonator matches with the specially tailored Rabi and resonant frequencies of the drive. Our calculations indicate that state-preparation fidelities in excess of 99\% and the required time on the order of magnitude of microsecond are in principle possible for experimentally reasonable sample parameters. Furthermore, our proposal could be applied to other systems with spin-based qubits.

Stefano Longhi  
Opt. lett. 39, 5892 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3486  
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest a method for trapping photons in quasi one-dimensional waveguide or coupled-resonator lattices, which is based on an optical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm cages for charged particles. Light trapping results from a destructive interference of Aharonov-Bohm type induced by a synthetic magnetic field, which is realized by periodic modulation of the waveguide/resonator propagation constants/resonances.

**14.    Perturbation Methods for Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion Equation**  
Jie Xu, Xinyu Zhao, Jun Jing, Lian-Ao Wu, Ting Yu  
Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, Vol. 47, No. 43, 435301 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4178  
<blockquote>
<p>
Two perturbation methods for the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) equation are investigated. The first perturbation method under investigation is based on a functional expansion of the NMQSD equation, while the second one expands the NMQSD equation in terms of the coupling strength. We have compared the advantages of the two methods based on bipartite systems where the accuracy of both perturbation methods can be examined by comparing the approximations with the exact solutions. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for a special family of system's initial states, and the entanglement dynamics is discussed based on this solution.

**15.    Spontaneous parametric downconversion in waveguides: What's loss got to do with it?**  
L. G. Helt, J. E. Sipe, M. J. Steel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4219  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive frequency correlation and exit probability expressions for photons generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguides that exhibit linear scattering loss. Such loss is included within a general Hamiltonian formalism by connecting waveguide modes to reservoir modes with a phenomenological coupling Hamiltonian, the parameters of which are later related to the usual loss coefficients. In the limit of a low probability of SPDC pair production, the presence of loss requires that we write the usual lossless generated pair state as a reduced density operator, and we find that this density operator is naturally composed of two photon, one photon, and zero photon contributions. The biphoton probability density, or joint spectral intensity (JSI), associated with the two-photon contribution is determined not only by a phase matching term, but also by a loss matching term. The relative size of the loss coefficients within this term lead to three qualitatively different regimes of SPDC JSIs. If either the pump or generated photon loss is much higher than the other, the side lobes of the phase matching squared sinc function are washed out. On the other hand, if pump and generated photon loss are appropriately balanced, the lossy JSI is identical to the lossless JSI. Finally, if the generated photon loss is frequency dependent, the shape of the JSI can be altered more severely, potentially leading to generated photons that are less frequency correlated though also produced less efficiently when compared to photons generated in low-loss waveguides.

**16.    Sanov and Central Limit Theorems for output statistics of quantum Markov chains**  
Merlijn van Horssen, Madalin Guta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5082  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we consider the statistics of repeated measurements on the output of a quantum Markov chain. We establish a large deviations result analogous to Sanov's theorem for the empirical measure associated to finite sequences of consecutive outcomes of a classical stochastic process. Our result relies on the construction of an extended quantum transition operator (which keeps track of previous outcomes) in terms of which we compute moment generating functions, and whose spectral radius is related to the large deviations rate function. As a corollary to this we obtain a central limit theorem for the empirical measure. Such higher level statistics may be used to uncover critical behaviour such as dynamical phase transitions, which are not captured by lower level statistics such as the sample mean. As a step in this direction we give an example of a finite system whose level-one rate function is independent of a model parameter while the level-two rate is not.

**17.    Fisher informations and local asymptotic normality for continuous-time quantum Markov processes**  
Catalin Catana, Luc Bouten, Madalin Guta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5131  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of estimating an arbitrary dynamical parameter of an quantum open system in the input-output formalism. For irreducible Markov processes, we show that in the limit of large times the system-output state can be approximated by a quantum Gaussian state whose mean is proportional to the unknown parameter. This approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size $t^{-1/2}$ in the parameter space, and provides an explicit expression of the asymptotic quantum Fisher information in terms of the Markov generator. Furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the corresponding classical Fisher informations. The mathematical theorems are illustrated with the examples of a two-level system and the atom maser. Our results contribute towards a better understanding of the statistical and probabilistic properties of the output process, with relevance for quantum control engineering, and the theory of non-equilibrium quantum open systems.

**18.    Non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems without rotating wave approximation**  
Ming-Jia Tang, Yu-Kai Wu, Ming Lyu, Jia-Nan Tang, Zhen Guo, Tian Chen, Xiang-Bin Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5359  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovian dynamics of a damped oscillator coupled with a reservoir. We present exact formulas for the oscillator's evolution directly from the BCH formula by series expansion with neither Markovian nor rotating wave approximation (RWA). Based on these, we show the existence of the non-Markovian feature of the system's evolution for the damped oscillator. By numerical simulation we find that the non-Markovian feature exists within a wide range of the coupling strength, even when the coupling strength is very small. To this problem, prior art results have assumed RWA and the existence of non-Markovian feature was found when the system-reservoir coupling is strong enough. However, as we show, given such a strong coupling, the original Hamiltonian without RWA is actually not physical. Therefore, our exact study here has thoroughly concluded the issue of non-Markovian feature.

Science Advances 1, e1500087 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5424  
<blockquote>
<p>
The "quantum walk" has emerged recently as a paradigmatic process for the dynamic simulation of complex quantum systems, entanglement production and quantum computation. Hitherto, photonic implementations of quantum walks have mainly been based on multi-path interferometric schemes in real space. Here, we report the experimental realization of a discrete quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous photons. In contrast to previous implementations, the whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers; it requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps; and it allows flexible control of input and output superposition states. Exploiting the latter property, we explored the system band structure in momentum space and the associated spin-orbit topological features by simulating the quantum dynamics of Gaussian wavepackets. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for quantum simulations.

**20.    Schr?dinger equation derived from complex Gaussian propagator with no prior physical assumptions**  
P. M. Grinwald  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5954  
<blockquote>
<p>
Feynman based his path integral approach on a Lagrangian formula for the physical action, transposed into the complex number system by a rule that is arbitrary; Gaussian integrals then lead to the Schr\"odinger equation. Here we dispense with the action formula, and work directly with the complex-valued Gaussian as an object of interest in its own right. We show that there is no need to postulate any physics to start with, because the Gaussian, with all its terms made fully complex, and acting as a propagator, describes the relevant physics anyway, provided only that the system is normalized in the standard way. Thus we derive the non relativistic Schr\"odinger equation including scalar and vector potentials, using no prior physical assumptions, but rather as a process of irregular motion that has the essential characteristics of the random walk in R except that it is executed under the rules of C. Thus Schr\"odinger's equation is an expression of the laws of large numbers via the Gaussian, and does not have to be viewed as an irreducible postulate of empirical physics.

<p>
We analyze the generation of linear optical cluster states (LOCS) via addition of one and two qubits. Existing approaches employ the stochastic linear optical two-qubit CZ gate with success rate of 1/9 per fusion operation. The question of optimality of the CZ gate with respect to LOCS generation remains open. We report that there are alternative schemes to the CZ gate that are exponentially more efficient and show that sequential LOCS growth is globally optimal. We find that the optimal cluster growth operation is a state transformation on a subspace of the full Hilbert space. We show that the maximal success rate of fusing n photonic qubits or m Bell pairs is 1/2^n-1 and 1/4^m-1 respectively and give an explicit optical design.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6073  
<blockquote>
<p>
Nanoscale integrated photonic devices and circuits offer a path to ultra-low power computation at the few-photon level. Here we propose an optical circuit that performs a ubiquitous operation: the controlled, random-access readout of a collection of stored memory phases or, equivalently, the computation of the inner product of a vector of phases with a binary "selector" vector, where the arithmetic is done modulo 2pi and the result is encoded in the phase of a coherent field. This circuit, a collection of cascaded interferometers driven by a coherent input field, demonstrates the use of coherence as a computational resource, and of the use of recently-developed mathematical tools for modeling optical circuits with many coupled parts. The construction extends in a straightforward way to the computation of matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products, and, with the inclusion of an optical feedback loop, to the computation of a "weighted" readout of stored memory phases. We note some applications of these circuits for error correction and for computing tasks requiring fast vector inner products, e.g. statistical classification and some machine learning algorithms.

We study the photon-photon correlation properties of two-photon transport in a one-dimensional waveguide coupled to a nonlinear cavity via a real-space approach. It is shown that the intrinsic dissipation of the nonlinear cavity has an important effect upon the correlation of the transported photons. More importantly, strongly correlated photons can be obtained in the transmitted photons even when the nonlinear interaction strength is weak in the cavity. The strong photon-photon correlation is induced by the Fano resonance involving destructive interference between the plane wave and bound state for two-photon transport.

<blockquote>
<p>
High-quality random samples of quantum states are needed for a variety of tasks in quantum information and quantum computation. Searching the high-dimensional quantum state space for a global maximum of an objective function with many local maxima or evaluating an integral over a region in the quantum state space are but two exemplary applications of many. These tasks can only be performed reliably and efficiently with Monte Carlo methods, which involve good samplings of the parameter space in accordance with the relevant target distribution. We show how the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, or hybrid Monte Carlo, can be adapted to this context. It is applicable when an efficient parameterization of the state space is available. The resulting random walk is entirely inside the physical parameter space, and the Hamiltonian dynamics enable us to take big steps, thereby avoiding strong correlations between successive sample points while enjoying a high acceptance rate. We use examples of single and double qubit measurements for illustration.

**25.    Using arbitrary parity-check matrices for quantum error correction assisted by less noisy qubits**  
Yuichiro Fujiwara  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7909  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently a framework for assisted quantum error correction was proposed in which a specific type of error is allowed to occur on auxiliary qubits, which is in contrast to standard entanglement assistance that requires noiseless auxiliary qubits. However, while the framework maintains the ability to import any binary or quaternary linear code without sacrificing active error correction power, it requires the code designer to turn a parity-check matrix of the underlying classical code into an equivalent one in standard form. This means that classical coding theoretic techniques that require parity-check matrices to be in specific form may not fully be exploitable. Another issue of the recently proposed scheme is that the error correction capabilities for bit errors and phase errors are generally equal, which is not ideal for asymmetric error models. This paper addresses these two problems. We generalize the framework in such a way that any parity-check matrix of any binary or quaternary linear code can be exploited. Our generalization also allows for importing a pair of distinct linear codes so that error correction capabilities become suitably asymmetric.

<p>
We implement a quantum walk in phase space with a new mechanism based on the superconducting resonator-assisted double quantum dots. By analyzing the hybrid system, we obtain the necessary factors of realization of a quantum walk in phase space: the walker, coin, coin flipping and conditional phase shift. In order to implement the coin flipping operator, we add a driving field to the resonator. The interaction between the quantum dots and resonator field is used to implement conditional phase shift. Furthermore, we show with different driving fields the quantum walk in phase space exhibits a ballistic behavior over 25 steps and numerically analyze the factors which influence the spreading of the walker in phase space.

**27.    Efficient Approximation of Quantum Channel Capacities**  
David Sutter, Tobias Sutter, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Renato Renner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8202  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an iterative method for approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite dimensional output, possibly under additional constraints on the input distribution. Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an $\varepsilon$-close estimate to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires $O(\tfrac{(N \vee M) M^3 \log(N)^{1/2}}{\varepsilon})$, where $N$ denotes the input alphabet size and $M$ the output dimension. We then generalize the method for the task of approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded continuous input alphabet and a finite dimensional output. For channels with a finite dimensional quantum mechanical input and output, the idea of a universal encoder allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity using the same method. In particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can be reduced to a multidimensional integration problem. For families of quantum channels fulfilling a certain assumption we show that the complexity to derive an $\varepsilon$-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme in practice.

Enrico Compagno, Leonardo Banchi, Sougato Bose  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8501  
<blockquote>
<p>
Tight binding lattices offer a unique platform in which particles may be either static or mobile depending on the potential barrier between the sites. It is tempting to use the static and mobile versions of the particles to store and process information respectively. Motivated by this, we show how a beam splitter between two hopping particles traveling from distant lattice sites can be implemented by an on-site potential at the center of the lattice. We show how this enables the two mode Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to be observed, and how the intra-site interaction results in a crossover from bosonic to fermionic behavior close to the superfluid-Mott transition point. A tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer is implemented adding a step-like potential. Finally we discuss how our results may pave the way towards the realization of a KLM quantum computer with bosonic neutral atoms in a lattice setup.

We report experiments on superconducting flux qubits in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup. Two qubits, independently biased and controlled, are coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Dispersive qubit state readout reaches a maximum contrast of $72\,\%$. We find intrinsic energy relaxation times at the symmetry point of $7\,\mu\text{s}$ and $20\,\mu\text{s}$ and levels of flux noise of $2.6\,\mu \Phi_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and $2.7\,\mu \Phi_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz for the two qubits. We discuss the origin of decoherence in the measured devices. These results demonstrate the potential of cQED as a platform for fundamental investigations of decoherence and quantum dynamics of flux qubits.

We give a brief introduction to private quantum codes, a basic notion in quantum cryptography and key distribution. Private code states are characterized by indistinguishability of their output states under the action of a quantum channel, and we show that higher rank numerical ranges can be used to describe them. We also show how this description arises naturally via conjugate channels and the bridge between quantum error correction and cryptography.

We study the performance of SUPCODE---a family of dynamically correcting pulses designed to cancel simultaneously both Overhauser and charge noise for singlet-triplet spin qubits---adapted to silicon devices with electrostatic control. We consider both natural Si and isotope-enriched Si systems, and in each case we investigate the behavior of individual gates under static noise and perform randomized benchmarking to obtain the average gate error under realistic 1/f noise. We find that in most cases SUPCODE pulses offer roughly an order of magnitude reduction in gate error, and especially in the case of isotope-enriched Si, SUPCODE yields gate operations of very high fidelity. We also develop a version of SUPCODE that cancels the charge noise only, "$\delta J$-SUPCODE", which is particularly beneficial for isotope-enriched Si devices where charge noise dominates Overhauser noise, offering a level of error reduction comparable to the original SUPCODE while yielding gate times that are 30% to 50% shorter. Our results show that the SUPCODE noise-compensating pulses provide a fast, simple, and effective approach to error suppression, bringing gate errors well below the quantum error correction threshold in principle.

**32.    Spectral broadening and shaping of nanosecond pulses: towards shaping of single photons from quantum emitters**

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate spectral broadening and shaping of exponentially-decaying nanosecond pulses via nonlinear mixing with a phase-modulated pump in a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. A strong, 1550~nm pulse is imprinted with a temporal phase and used to upconvert a weak 980 nm pulse to 600 nm while simultaneously broadening the spectrum to that of a Lorentzian pulse up to 10 times shorter. While the current experimental demonstration is for spectral shaping, we also provide a numerical study showing the feasibility of subsequent spectral phase correction to achieve temporal compression and re-shaping of a 1~ns mono-exponentially decaying pulse to a 250 ps Lorentzian, which would constitute a complete spectro-temporal waveform shaping protocol. This method, which uses quantum frequency conversion in PPLN with >100:1 signal-to-noise ratio, is compatible with single photon states of light.

<p>
In this comment we argue that negative absolute temperatures are a well-established concept for systems with bounded spectra. They are not only consistent with thermodynamics, but are even unavoidable for a consistent description of the thermal equilibrium of inverted populations.

Sixty years ago, Karplus and Luttinger pointed out that quantum particles moving on a lattice could acquire an anomalous transverse velocity in response to a force, providing an explanation for the unusual Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals. A striking manifestation of this transverse transport was then revealed in the quantum Hall effect, where the plateaus depicted by the Hall conductivity were attributed to a topological invariant characterizing Bloch bands: the Chern number. Until now, topological transport associated with non-zero Chern numbers has only been revealed in electronic systems. Here we use studies of an atomic cloud's transverse deflection in response to an optical gradient to measure the Chern number of artificially generated Hofstadter bands. These topological bands are very flat and thus constitute good candidates for the realization of fractional Chern insulators. Combining these deflection measurements with the determination of the band populations, we obtain an experimental value for the Chern number of the lowest band $\nu_{\mathrm{exp}} =0.99(5)$. This result, which constitutes the first Chern-number measurement in a non-electronic system, is facilitated by an all-optical artificial gauge field scheme, generating uniform flux in optical superlattices.

<blockquote>
<p>
The lasing and coherent perfect absorption (CPA) properties of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric microrings with mixed index and gain gratings, externally coupled to a bus waveguide, are theoretically investigated. For a complex grating at the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point, perfect unidirectional (either clockwise or counterclockwise) laser emission can be realized, however the grating does not discriminate longitudinal modes and CPA can not be simultaneously achieved. Above the grating $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point, single mode emission and simultaneous CPA can be obtained, with unbalanced and controllable excitation of clockwise and counterclockwise modes in the ring.

Many superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to dielectric loss, making the fabrication of coherent quantum circuits challenging. To elucidate this issue, we characterize the interfaces and surfaces of superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators and study the associated microwave loss. We show that contamination induced by traditional qubit lift-off processing is particularly detrimental to quality factors without proper substrate cleaning, while roughness plays at most a small role. Aggressive surface treatment is shown to damage the crystalline substrate and degrade resonator quality. We also introduce methods to characterize and remove ultra-thin resist residue, providing a way to quantify and minimize remnant sources of loss on device surfaces.

The geometric structure of an energy band in a solid is fundamental for a wide range of many-body phenomena in condensed matter and is uniquely characterized by the distribution of Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. In analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures the magnetic flux penetrating a given area in real space, we realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal lattice, where it has allowed us to directly detect the singular $\pi$ Berry flux localized at each Dirac point. We show that the interferometer enables one to determine the distribution of Berry curvature with high momentum resolution. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures and can also facilitate holonomic quantum computing through controlled exploitation of the geometry of Hilbert space.
