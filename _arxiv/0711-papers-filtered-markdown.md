**1.    Quantum Cloning of Continuous Variable Entangled States**  
Christian Weedbrook, Nicolai B. Grosse, Thomas Symul, Ping Koy Lam, Timothy C. Ralph  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 052313 (2008).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0039  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the quantum cloning of continuous variable entangled states. This is achieved by introducing two symmetric entanglement cloning machines (or e-cloners): a local e-cloner and a global e-cloner; where we look at the preservation of entanglement in the clones under the condition that the fidelity of the clones is maximized. These cloning machines are implemented using simple linear optical elements such as beam splitters and homodyne detection along with squeeze gates. We show that the global e-cloner out-performs the local e-cloner both in terms of the fidelity of the cloned states as well as the strength of the entanglement of the clones. There is a minimum strength of entanglement (3dB for the inseparability criterion and 5.7dB for the EPR paradox criterion) of the input state of the global e-cloner that is required to preserve the entanglement in the clones.

**2.    Negative refraction with tunable absorption in an active dense gas of atoms**  
P. P. Orth, R. Hennig, C. H. Keitel, J. Evers  
New J. Phys. 15, 013027 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0303  
<blockquote>
<p>
Applications of negative index materials (NIM) presently are severely limited by absorption. Next to improvements of metamaterial designs, it has been suggested that dense gases of atoms could form a NIM with negligible losses. In such gases, the low absorption is facilitated by quantum interference. Here, we show that additional gain mechanisms can be used to tune and effectively remove absorption in a dense gas NIM. In our setup, the atoms are coherently prepared by control laser fields, and further driven by a weak incoherent pump field to induce gain. We employ nonlinear optical Bloch equations to analyze the optical response. Metastable Neon is identified as a suitable experimental candidate at infrared frequencies to implement a lossless active negative index material.

**3.    Efficient feedback controllers for continuous-time quantum error correction**  
Bradley A. Chase, Andrew J. Landahl, J. M. Geremia  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 032304 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0689  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient approach to continuous-time quantum error correction that extends the low-dimensional quantum filtering methodology developed by van Handel and Mabuchi [quant-ph/0511221 (2005)] to include error recovery operations in the form of real-time quantum feedback. We expect this paradigm to be useful for systems in which error recovery operations cannot be applied instantaneously. While we could not find an exact low-dimensional filter that combined both continuous syndrome measurement and a feedback Hamiltonian appropriate for error recovery, we developed an approximate reduced-dimensional model to do so. Simulations of the five-qubit code subjected to the symmetric depolarizing channel suggests that error correction based on our approximate filter performs essentially identically to correction based on an exact quantum dynamical model.

**4.    Review on qudits production and their application to Quantum Communication and Studies on Local Realism**  
Marco Genovese, Paolo Traina  
Adv. Sci. Lett. 1, 153-160 (2008).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1288  
<blockquote>
<p>
The codification in higher dimensional Hilbert Spaces (whose logical basis states are dubbed qudits in analogy with bidimensional qubits) presents various advantages both for Quantum Information applications and for studies on Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Purpose of this review is to introduce qudits, to summarize their application to Quantum Communication and researches on Local Realism and, finally, to describe some recent experiment for realizing them. A Little more in details: after a short introduction, we will consider the advantages of testing local realism with qudits, discussing both the 3-4 dimensional case (both for maximally and non-maximally entanglement) and then the extension to an arbitrary dimension. Afterwards, we will discuss the theoretical results on using qudits for quantum communication, epitomizing the outcomes on a larger security in Quantum Key Distribution protocols (again considering separately qutrits, ququats and generalization to arbitrary dimension). Finally, we will present the experiments performed up to now for producing quantum optical qudits and their applications. In particular, we will mention schemes based on interferometric set-ups, orbital angular momentum entanglement and biphoton polarization. Finally, we will summarize what hyperentanglement is and its applications.

**5.    Emission spectra of atoms with non-Markovian interaction: Fluorescence in a photonic crystal**  
Ines de Vega, Daniel Alonso  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1499  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a formula to evaluate the spontaneous emission spectra of an atom in contact with a radiation field with non-Markovian effects. This formula is written in terms of a two-time correlation of system observables and the environmental correlation function, and depends on the distance between the emitting atom and the detector. As an example, we use it to analyze the fluorescence spectra of a two level atom placed as an impurity in a photonic crystal. The radiation field within those materials has a gap or discontinuity where electromagnetic modes cannot propagate in the stationary limit. In that situation, the atomic emission occurs in the form of evanescent waves which are detected with less efficiency the farther we place the detector. The methodology presented in this paper may be useful to study the non-Markovian dynamics of any quantum open system in linear interaction with a harmonic oscillator reservoir and within the weak coupling approximation.

**6.    Decoherence in quantum walks and quantum computers**  
Andrew P. Hines, P.C.E. Stamp  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1555  
<blockquote>
<p>
Decoherence is the major stumbling block in the realization of a large-scale quantum computer. Ingenious methods have been devised to overcome decoherence, but their success has been proven only for over-simplified models of system-environment interaction. Whether such methods will be reliable in the face of more realistic models is a fundamental open question. In this partly pedagogical article, we study two toy models of quantum information processing, using the language of \emph{quantum walks}. Decoherence is incorporated in 3 ways - by coupling to a noisy `projective measurement' system, and by coupling to oscillator and spin baths.

**7.    Symmetry in quantum walks**  
Hari Krovi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1694  
<blockquote>
<p>
A discrete-time quantum walk on a graph is the repeated application of a unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph. Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before the walk reaches an ending condition. We derive an expression for hitting time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the walk on the hypercube for various coins and decoherence models. We show that, by contrast to classical walks, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial states. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have infinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition for their existence. The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Symmetries of a graph, given by its automorphism group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. Using the irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions such that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times for some initial states. Symmetry can also cause the walk to be confined to a subspace of the original Hilbert space for certain initial states. We show that a quantum walk confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group can be seen as a different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph and we give an explicit construction of the quotient graph. We conjecture that the existence of a small quotient graph with finite hitting times is necessary for a walk to exhibit a quantum speed-up. Finally, we use symmetry and the theory of decoherence-free subspaces to determine when the subspace of the quotient graph is a decoherence-free subspace of the dynamics.

**8.    On the optimality of individual entangling-probe attacks against BB84 quantum key distribution**  
I. Herbauts, S. Bettelli, H. HÃ¼bel, M. Peev  
Eur. Phys. J. D, 46, 395-406 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1728  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that an existing method to study ideal individual attacks on the BB84 QKD protocol using error discard can be adapted to reconciliation with error correction, and that an optimal attack can be explicitly found. Moreover, this attack fills Luetkenhaus bound, independently of whether error positions are leaked to Eve, proving that it is tight. In addition, we clarify why the existence of such optimal attacks is not in contradiction with the established ``old-style'' theory of BB84 individual attacks, as incorrectly suggested recently in a news feature.

**9.    Optimizing the discrete time quantum walk using a SU(2) coin**  
C.M. Chandrashekar, R. Srikanth, Raymond Laflamme  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 032326 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1882  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a generalized version of the discrete time quantum walk, using the SU(2) operation as the quantum coin. By varying the coin parameters, the quantum walk can be optimized for maximum variance subject to the functional form $\sigma^2 \approx N^2$ and the probability distribution in the position space can be biased. We also discuss the variation in measurement entropy with the variation of the parameters in the SU(2) coin. Exploiting this we show how quantum walk can be optimized for improving mixing time in an $n$-cycle and for quantum walk search.

**10.    Quantum properties of counter-propagating two-photon states generated in a planar waveguide**  
Jan Perina Jr  
Phys. Rev. A 77 (2008) 013803  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2025  
<blockquote>
<p>
A nonlinear planar waveguide pumped by a beam orthogonal to its surface may serve as a versatile source of photon pairs. Changing pump-pulse duration, pump-beam transverse width, and angular decomposition of pump-beam frequencies characteristics of a photon pair including spectral widths of signal and idler fields, their time durations as well as degree of entanglement of two fields can be changed significantly. Using the measured spectral widths of the down-converted fields and width of a coincidence-count dip in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer entropy of entanglement can be determined.

**11.    Nonlinear optical spectroscopy of single, few, and many molecules; nonequilibrium Green's function QED approach**  
Christoph A. Marx, Upendra Harbola, Shaul Mukamel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2094  
<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear optical signals from an assembly of N noninteracting particles consist of an incoherent and a coherent component, whose magnitudes scale \sim N and \sim N(N-1), respectively. A unified microscopic description of both types of signals is developed using a quantum electrodynamical (QED) treatment of the optical fields. Closed nonequilibrium Green's function expressions are derived that incorporate both stimulated and spontaneous processes. General (n+1)-wave mixing experiments are discussed as an example of spontaneously generated signals. When performed on a single particle, such signals cannot be expressed in terms of the nth order polarization, as predicted by the semiclassical theory. Stimulated processes are shown to be purely incoherent in nature. Within the QED framework, heterodyne-detected wave mixing signals are simply viewed as incoherent stimulated emission, whereas homodyne signals are generated by coherent spontaneous emission.

**12.    Entanglement generation using silicon wire waveguide**  
Hiroki Takesue, Yasuhiro Tokura, Hiroshi Fukuda, Tai Tsuchizawa, Toshifumi Watanabe, Koji Yamada, Sei-ichi Itabashi  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 201108 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2328  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the first entanglement generation experiment that utilizes a silicon waveguide. Using spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1.09-cm-long silicon wire waveguide, we generated 1.5-um, high-purity time-bin entangled photons without temperature control, and observed a two-photon interference fringe with >73% visibility.

**13.    Non-Markovian decoherence and disentanglement scenarios in quantum Brownian motion**  
C. Hoerhammer, H. Buettner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3138  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovian decoherence and disentanglement dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with special emphasis on non-Gaussian continuous variable systems. The dynamics are described by the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation of quantum Brownian motion. The time evolution of the decoherence function of a single-mode superposition is compared to the concurrence of a two-mode entangled state. It is verified that moderate non-Markovian influences slow down the decay of interference fringes and quantum correlations, while strong non-Markovian effects resulting from an out-of-resonance bath can even accelerate the loss of coherence, compared to predictions of Markovian approximations. Qualitatively different scenarios including exponential, Gaussian or algebraic decay of the decoherence function are analyzed. It is shown that partial revivals of coherence can occur in case of non-Lindblad-type dynamics.

**14.    Assessing non-Markovian dynamics**  
M.M. Wolf, J. Eisert, T.S. Cubitt, J.I. Cirac  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3172  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate what a snapshot of a quantum evolution - a quantum channel reflecting open system dynamics - reveals about the underlying continuous time evolution. Remarkably, from such a snapshot, and without imposing additional assumptions, it can be decided whether or not a channel is consistent with a time (in)dependent Markovian evolution, for which we provide computable necessary and sufficient criteria. Based on these, a computable measure of `Markovianity' is introduced. We discuss how the consistency with Markovian dynamics can be checked in quantum process tomography. The results also clarify the geometry of the set of quantum channels with respect to being solutions of time (in)dependent master equations.

**15.    Complementarity of Private and Correctable Subsystems in Quantum Cryptography and Error Correction**  
Dennis Kretschmann, David W. Kribs, Robert W. Spekkens  
Phys. Rev. A 78, 032330 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3438  
<blockquote>
<p>
We make an explicit connection between fundamental notions in quantum cryptography and quantum error correction. Error-correcting subsystems (and subspaces) for quantum channels are the key vehicles for contending with noise in physical implementations of quantum information-processing. Private subsystems (and subspaces) for quantum channels play a central role in cryptographic schemes such as quantum secret sharing and private quantum communication. We show that a subsystem is private for a channel precisely when it is correctable for a complementary channel. This result is shown to hold even for approximate notions of private and correctable defined in terms of the diamond norm for superoperators.

**16.    Sequential Implementation of Global Quantum Operations**  
L. Lamata, J. Leon, D. Perez-Garcia, D. Salgado, E. Solano  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 180506 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3652  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the possibility for a global unitary applied on an arbitrary number of qubits to be decomposed in a sequential unitary procedure, where an ancillary system is allowed to interact only once with each qubit. We prove that sequential unitary decompositions are in general impossible for genuine entangling operations, even with an infinite-dimensional ancilla, being the controlled-NOT gate a paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, we find particular nontrivial operations in quantum information that can be performed in a sequential unitary manner, as is the case of quantum error correction and quantum cloning.

**17.    Effects of relative phase and interactions on atom-laser outcoupling from a double-well Bose-Einstein condensate: Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics**

J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 41 (2008) 025301.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3731  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate aspects of the dynamics of a continuous atom-laser scheme based on the merging of independently formed atomic condensates. Our theoretical analysis covers the Markovian as well as the non-Markovian operational regimes, and is based on a semiclassical (mean-field) two-mode model. The role of the relative phase between the two condensates and the effect of interatomic interactions on the evolution of the trapped populations and the distribution of outcoupled atoms are discussed.

**18.    Universal Behavior of Quantum Walks with Long-Range Steps**  
Oliver Muelken, Volker Pernice, Alexander Blumen  
Phys. Rev. E 77, 021117 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3762  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks with long-range steps $R^{-\gamma}$ ($R$ being the distance between sites) on a discrete line behave in similar ways for all $\gamma\geq2$. This is in contrast to classical random walks, which for $\gamma >3$ belong to a different universality class than for $\gamma \leq 3$. We show that the average probabilities to be at the initial site after time $t$ as well as the mean square displacements are of the same functional form for quantum walks with $\gamma=2$, 4, and with nearest neighbor steps. We interpolate this result to arbitrary $\gamma\geq2$.

**19.    Unitarity plus causality implies localizability**  
Pablo Arrighi, Vincent Nesme, Reinhard Werner  
QIP 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3975  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a graph with a single quantum system at each node. The entire compound system evolves in discrete time steps by iterating a global evolution $U$. We require that this global evolution $U$ be unitary, in accordance with quantum theory, and that this global evolution $U$ be causal, in accordance with special relativity. By causal we mean that information can only ever be transmitted at a bounded speed, the speed bound being quite naturally that of one edge of the underlying graph per iteration of $U$. We show that under these conditions the operator $U$ can be implemented locally; i.e. it can be put into the form of a quantum circuit made up with more elementary operators -- each acting solely upon neighbouring nodes. We take quantum cellular automata as an example application of this representation theorem: this analysis bridges the gap between the axiomatic and the constructive approaches to defining QCA.

**20.    The Expressional Limits of Formal Languages in the Notion of Observation**  
Stathis Livadas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4155  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article I deal with the notion of observation in the most fundamental sense and its representation by means of formal languages serving as expressional tools of formal-axiomatical theories. In doing so, I have taken this notion in two diverse contexts. In the first as an epistemic notion that refers to its interpretation in a formal mathematical environment and then to its interpretation in a quantum mechanical environment. The second context in which I tried to approach the notion of observation is that of a phenomenological constitution basically as it is described in E. Husserl's original works. Assuming that in phenomenological constitution mathematical objects are special cases of perceptual objects including consequently objects of a quantum mechanical measurement, the question is to inquire on the limits of their description in the language of a formal-axiomatical theory. On one hand, I derive an irreducibility on the level of observables as indecomposable atoms without any further syntactical content in formal representation and on the other a transcendence of a continuous substratum self-constituted as a kind of impredicative synthetic unity on which to define an observational frame and generate a predicative universe of discourse.

**21.    Generation of polarization entanglement from spatially-correlated photons in spontaneous parametric down-conversion**  
Ryosuke Shimizu, Takashi Yamaguchi, Yasuyoshi Mitsumori, Hideo Kosaka, Keiichi Edamatsu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4177  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel scheme to generate polarization entanglement from spatially-correlated photon pairs. We experimentally realized a scheme by means of a spatial correlation effect in a spontaneous parametric down-conversion and a modified Michelson interferometer. The scheme we propose in this paper can be interpreted as a conversion process from spatial correlation to polarization entanglement.

**22.    Quantum cloning a pair of orthogonally polarized photons with linear optics**  
Jaromir Fiurasek, Nicolas J. Cerf  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 052308 (2008).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4212  
<blockquote>
<p>
A linear optical probabilistic scheme for the optimal cloning of a pair of orthogonally-polarized photons is devised, based on single- and two-photon interferences. It consists in a partial symmetrization device, realized with a modified unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, followed by two independent Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers. This scheme has the advantage that it enables quantum cloning without the need for stimulated amplification in a nonlinear medium. It can also be modified so to make an optical two-qubit partial SWAP gate, thereby providing a potentially useful tool to linear optics quantum computing.

**23.    A hazard of open quantum dynamics: Markov approximations encounter map domains**  
Thomas F. Jordan, Anil Shaji, E. C. G. Sudarshan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4370  
<blockquote>
<p>
A Markov approximation in open quantum dynamics can give unphysical results when a map acts on a state that is not in its domain. This is examined here in a simple example, an open quantum dynamics for one qubit in a system of two interacting qubits, for which the map domains have been described quite completely. A time interval is split into two parts and the map from the exact dynamics for the entire interval is replaced by the conjunction of that same map for both parts. If there is any correlation between the two qubits, unphysical results can appear as soon as the map conjunction is used, even for infinitesimal times. If the map is repeated an unlimited number of times, every state is at risk of being taken outside the bounds of physical meaning. Treatment by slippage of initial conditions is discussed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3347  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate spectral properties of a quantum particle confined to an infinite straight planar strip by imposing Robin boundary conditions with variable coupling. Assuming that the coupling function tends to a constant at infinity, we localize the essential spectrum and derive a sufficient condition which guarantees the existence of bound states. Further properties of the associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are studied numerically by the mode-matching technique.

**25.    A Coupled Oscillator Model for Grover's Quantum Database Search Algorithm**  
Aavishkar A. Patel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4733  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover's database search algorithm is the optimal algorithm for finding a desired object from an unsorted collection of items. Although it was discovered in the context of quantum computation, it is simple and versatile enough to be implemented using any physical system that allows superposition of states, and several proposals have been made in the literature. I study a mechanical realisation of the algorithm using coupled simple harmonic oscillators, and construct its physical model for the simplest case of four identical oscillators. The identification oracle is implemented as an elastic reflection of the desired oscillator, and the overrelaxation operation is realised as evolution of the system by half an oscillation period. I derive the equations of motion, and solve them both analytically and by computer simulation. I extend the ideal case analysis and explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to changes in the initial conditions, masses of springs and damping. The amplitude amplification provided by the algorithm enhances the energy of the desired oscillator, while running the algorithm backwards spreads out the energy of the perturbed oscillator among its partners. The former (efficient focusing of energy into a specific oscillator) can have interesting applications in processes that need crossing of an energy threshold for completion, and can be useful in nanotechnological devices and catalysis. The latter (efficient redistribution of energy) can be useful in processes requiring rapid dissipation of energy, such as shock-absorbers and vibrational shielding. I present some tentative proposals.
