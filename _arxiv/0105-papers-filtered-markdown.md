**1.    Robust control in the quantum domain**  
Andrew Doherty, John Doyle, Hideo Mabuchi, Kurt Jacobs, Salman Habib  
Proceedings of the 39th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, p949 (2000)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105018  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent progress in quantum physics has made it possible to perform experiments in which individual quantum systems are monitored and manipulated in real time. The advent of such new technical capabilities provides strong motivation for the development of theoretical and experimental methodologies for quantum feedback control. The availability of such methods would enable radically new approaches to experimental physics in the quantum realm. Likewise, the investigation of quantum feedback control will introduce crucial new considerations to control theory, such as the uniquely quantum phenomena of entanglement and measurement back-action. The extension of established analysis techniques from control theory into the quantum domain may also provide new insight into the dynamics of complex quantum systems. We anticipate that the successful formulation of an input-output approach to the analysis and reduction of large quantum systems could have very general applications in non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and in the nascent field of quantum information theory.

**2.    Self-consistent non-Markovian theory of a quantum state evolution for quantum information processing**  
Doyeol Ahn, Jinhyoung Lee, S. W. Hwang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105065  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that the operator sum representation for non-Markovian dynamics and the Lindblad master equation in Markovian limit can be derived from a formal solution to quantum Liouville equation for a qubit system in the presence of decoherence processes self-consistently. Our formulation is the first principle theory based on projection-operator formalism to obtain an exact reduced density operator in time-convolutionless form starting from the quantum Liouville equation for a noisy quantum computer. The advantage of our approach is that it is general enough to describe a realistic quantum computer in the presence of decoherence provided details of the Hamiltonians are known.

**3.    Feasible Linear-optics Generation of Polarization-entangled Photons Assisted with Single-photon Quantum Non-demolition Measurement**  
Zeng-Bing Chen, Jian-Wei Pan, Yong-De Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105100  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a feasible scheme to create $n$-party ($n\geq 2$) polarization-entangled photon states in a controllable way. The scheme requires only single-photon sources, single-photon quantum non-demolition measurement (SP-QNDM) and simple linear optical elements, usually with high perfections. The SP-QNDM acts as a non-destructive projection measurement onto the wanted entangled states and filters out the unwanted terms. Our scheme in fact realizes entanglement of non-interacting photons; the interaction occurs only implicitly in the optical elements and SP-QNDM. We also briefly consider purification of mixed single-photon states within our scheme.

**4.    Dynamical description of quantum computing: generic nonlocality of quantum noise**  
Robert Alicki, Michal Horodecki, Pawel Horodecki, Ryszard Horodecki  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 062101 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105115  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop dynamical non-Markovian description of quantum computing in weak coupling limit, in lowest order approximation. We show that long range memory of quantum reservoir produces strong interrelation between structure of noise and quantum algorithm, implying nonlocal attacks of noise. We then argue that the quantum error correction method fails to protect quantum computation against electromagnetic or phonon vacuum which exhibit $1/t^4$ memory. This shows that the implicit assumption of quantum error correction theory -- independence of noise and self-dynamics -- fails in long time regimes. We also use our approach to present {\it pure} decoherence and decoherence accompanied by dissipation in terms of spectral density of reservoir. The so-called {\it dynamical decoupling} method is discussed in this context. Finally, we propose {\it minimal decoherence model}, in which the only source of decoherence is vacuum. We optimize fidelity of quantum information processing under the trade-off between speed of gate and strength of decoherence.

**5.    Proof of security of quantum key distribution with two-way classical communications**  
Daniel Gottesman, Hoi-Kwong Lo  
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 49, No. 2, p. 457 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105121  
<blockquote>
<p>
Shor and Preskill have provided a simple proof of security of the standard quantum key distribution scheme by Bennett and Brassard (BB84) by demonstrating a connection between key distribution and entanglement purification protocols with one-way communications. Here we provide proofs of security of standard quantum key distribution schemes, BB84 and the six-state scheme, against the most general attack, by using the techniques of *two*-way entanglement purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only one-way classical communications in QKD. This is done by the explicit construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy amplification of) BB84 that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which is higher than what any BB84 scheme with only one-way classical communications can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state scheme over BB84 by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a higher bit error rate than BB84. In particular, our six-state protocol can tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25% bit error rate for any secure BB84 protocol. Consequently, our protocols may allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error correction, and privacy amplification protocols.

**6.    Multivariable functions approximation using a single quantum neuron**  
A.A. Ezhov, A.G. Khromov, G.P. Berman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105134  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a model element able to perform universal stochastic approximations of continuous multivariable functions in both neuron-like and quantum form. The implementation of this model in the form of a multi-barrier, multiple-slit system is proposed and it is demonstrated that this single neuron-like model is able to perform the XOR function unrealizable with single classical neuron. For the simplified waveguide variant of this model it is proved for different interfering quantum alternatives with no correlated adjustable parameters, that the system can approximate any continuous function of many variables. This theorem is applied to the 2-input quantum neural model based on the use of the schemes developed for controlled nonlinear multiphoton absorption of light by quantum systems. The relation between the field of quantum neural computing and quantum control is discussed.

**7.    Strictly contractive quantum channels and physically realizable quantum computers**  
Maxim Raginsky  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 032306 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105141  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the robustness of quantum computers under the influence of errors modelled by strictly contractive channels. A channel $T$ is defined to be strictly contractive if, for any pair of density operators $\rho,\sigma$ in its domain, $\| T\rho - T\sigma \|_1 \le k \| \rho-\sigma \|_1$ for some $0 \le k < 1$ (here $\| \cdot \|_1$ denotes the trace norm). In other words, strictly contractive channels render the states of the computer less distinguishable in the sense of quantum detection theory. Starting from the premise that all experimental procedures can be carried out with finite precision, we argue that there exists a physically meaningful connection between strictly contractive channels and errors in physically realizable quantum computers. We show that, in the absence of error correction, sensitivity of quantum memories and computers to strictly contractive errors grows exponentially with storage time and computation time respectively, and depends only on the constant $k$ and the measurement precision. We prove that strict contractivity rules out the possibility of perfect error correction, and give an argument that approximate error correction, which covers previous work on fault-tolerant quantum computation as a special case, is possible.
