**1.    Adaptive homodyne measurement of optical phase**  
Michael A. Armen, John K. Au, John K. Stockton, Andrew C. Doherty, Hideo Mabuchi  
Phys. Rev. Lett., 89, 133602 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204005  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an experimental demonstration of the power of real-time feedback in quantum metrology, confirming a theoretical prediction by Wiseman regarding the superior performance of an adaptive homodyne technique for single-shot measurement of optical phase. For phase measurements performed on weak coherent states with no prior knowledge of the signal phase, we show that the variance of adaptive homodyne estimation approaches closer to the fundamental quantum uncertainty limit than any previously demonstrated technique. Our results underscore the importance of real-time feedback for reaching quantum performance limits in coherent telecommunication, precision measurement and information processing.

**2.    Quantum search by measurement**  
Andrew M. Childs, Enrico Deotto, Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, Sam Gutmann, Andrew J. Landahl  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 032314 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204013  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial search problems that uses only a sequence of measurements. The algorithm is similar in spirit to quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, in that the goal is to remain in the ground state of a time-varying Hamiltonian. Indeed, we show that the running times of the two algorithms are closely related. We also show how to achieve the quadratic speedup for Grover's unstructured search problem with only two measurements. Finally, we discuss some similarities and differences between the adiabatic and measurement algorithms.

**3.    A New Protocol and Lower Bounds for Quantum Coin Flipping**  
Andris Ambainis  
Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 68(2): 398-416, 2004.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204022  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new protocol and two lower bounds for quantum coin flipping. In our protocol, no dishonest party can achieve one outcome with probability more than 0.75. Then, we show that our protocol is optimal for a certain type of quantum protocols. For arbitrary quantum protocols, we show that if a protocol achieves a bias of at most $\epsilon$, it must use at least $\Omega(\log \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ rounds of communication. This implies that the parallel repetition fails for quantum coin flipping. (The bias of a protocol cannot be arbitrarily decreased by running several copies of it in parallel.)

**4.    Trading quantum for classical resources in quantum data compression**  
Patrick Hayden, Richard Jozsa, Andreas Winter  
J. Math. Phys. Vol. 43 No. 9 pp. 4404-4444 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204038  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the visible compression of a source E of pure quantum signal states, or, more formally, the minimal resources per signal required to represent arbitrarily long strings of signals with arbitrarily high fidelity, when the compressor is given the identity of the input state sequence as classical information. According to the quantum source coding theorem, the optimal quantum rate is the von Neumann entropy S(E) qubits per signal. We develop a refinement of this theorem in order to analyze the situation in which the states are coded into classical and quantum bits that are quantified separately. This leads to a trade--off curve Q(R), where Q(R) qubits per signal is the optimal quantum rate for a given classical rate of R bits per signal. Our main result is an explicit characterization of this trade--off function by a simple formula in terms of only single signal, perfect fidelity encodings of the source. We give a thorough discussion of many further mathematical properties of our formula, including an analysis of its behavior for group covariant sources and a generalization to sources with continuously parameterized states. We also show that our result leads to a number of corollaries characterizing the trade--off between information gain and state disturbance for quantum sources. In addition, we indicate how our techniques also provide a solution to the so--called remote state preparation problem. Finally, we develop a probability--free version of our main result which may be interpreted as an answer to the question: ``How many classical bits does a qubit cost?'' This theorem provides a type of dual to Holevo's theorem, insofar as the latter characterizes the cost of coding classical bits into qubits.

**5.    High-fidelity teleportation of entanglements of running-wave field states**  
R. M. Serra, C. J. Villas-Boas, N. G. de Almeida, M. H. Y. Moussa  
J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 4, 316 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204057  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a scheme for the teleportation of entanglements of zero- and one-photon running-wave field states. In addition to linear optical elements, Kerr nonlinearity is also employed so as to achieve a 100% probability of success in the ideal case. A comprehensive phenomenological treatment of errors in the domain of running-wave physics, for linear and nonlinear optical elements, is also given, making it possible to calculate the fidelity of the teleportation process. A strategy for carrying out the Bell-type measurement which is able to probe the absorption of photons in the optical elements is adopted. Such strategy, combined with usually small damping constants characterizing the optical devices, results in a high fidelity for the teleportation process. The feasibility of the proposed scheme relies on the fact that the Kerr nonlinearity it demands can be achieved through the recently reported ultraslow light propagation in cold atomic media [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1419 (2000); Phys. Rev. A 65, 033833 (2002)].

**6.    Lower bound for a class of weak quantum coin flipping protocols**

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204063  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the class of protocols for weak quantum coin flipping introduced by Spekkens and Rudolph (quant-ph/0202118). We show that, for any protocol in this class, one party can win the coin flip with probability at least $1/\sqrt{2}$.

**7.    Photon counting schemes and performance of non-deterministic nonlinear gates in linear optics**  
Stephen D. Bartlett, Eleni Diamanti, Barry C. Sanders, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
Proceedings of Free-Space Laser Communication and Laser Imaging II, Vol. 4821, SPIE International Symposium on Optical Science and Technology (7-11 July 2002), eds. J C Ricklin and D G Voelz (SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204073  
<blockquote>
<p>
The performance of nondeterministic nonlinear gates in linear optics relies on the photon counting scheme being employed and the efficiencies of the detectors in such schemes. We assess the performance of the nonlinear sign gate, which is a critical component of linear optical quantum computing, for two standard photon counting methods: the double detector array and the visible light photon counter. Our analysis shows that the double detector array is insufficient to provide the photon counting capability for effective nondeterministic nonlinear transformations, and we determine the gate fidelity for both photon counting methods as a function of detector efficiencies.

**8.    The characterization of Gaussian operations and Distillation of Gaussian States**  
GÃ©za Giedke, J. Ignacio Cirac  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 032316 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204085  
<blockquote>
<p>
We characterize the class of all physical operations that transform Gaussian states to Gaussian states. We show that this class coincides with that of all operations which can be performed on Gaussian states using linear optical elements and homodyne measurements. For bipartite systems we characterize the processes which can be implemented by local operations and classical communication, as well as those that can be implemented using positive partial transpose preserving maps. As an application, we show that Gaussian states cannot be distilled by local Gaussian operations and classical communication. We also define and characterize positive (but not completely positive) Gaussian maps.

**9.    Renyi-entropic bounds on quantum communication**  
Wim van Dam, Patrick Hayden  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204093  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we establish new bounds on the quantum communication complexity of distributed problems. Specifically, we consider the amount of communication that is required to transform a bipartite state into another, typically more entangled, state. We obtain lower bounds in this setting by studying the Renyi entropy of the marginal density matrices of the distributed system. The communication bounds on quantum state transformations also imply lower bounds for the model of communication complexity where the task consists of the the distributed evaluation of a function f(x,y). Our approach encapsulates several known lower bound methods that use the log-rank or the von Neumann entropy of the density matrices involved. The technique is also effective for proving lower bounds on problems involving a promise or for which the "hard" distributions of inputs are correlated. As examples, we show how to prove a nearly tight bound on the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of the inner product function in the presence of unlimited amounts of EPR-type entanglement and a similarly strong bound on the complexity of the shifted quadratic character problem.

**10.    Markovian Behaviour and Constrained Maximization of the Entropy in Chaotic Quantum Systems**  
A. Romanelli, A.C. Sicardi Schifino, G. Abal, R. Siri, R. Donangelo  
Physics Letters A 313 (2003) 325-329.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204135  
<blockquote>
<p>
The separation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a Markovian and an interference term provides a new insight in the quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems. The competition between these two terms determines the localized or diffusive character of the dynamics. In the case of the Kicked Rotor, we show how the constrained maximization of the entropy implies exponential localization.

**11.    Random Walk and Diffusion on a Smash Line Algebra**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Tsohantjis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204148  
<blockquote>
<p>
Working withing the framework of Hopf algebras, a random walk and the associated diffusion equation are constructed on a space that is algebraically described as the merging of the real line algebra with the anyonic line algebra. Technically this merged structure is a smash algebra, namely an algebra resulting by a braided tensoring of real with anyonic line algebras. The motivation of introducing the smashing results from the necessity of having non commuting increments in the random walk. Based on the observable-state duality provided by the underlying Hopf structure, the construction is cast into two dual forms: one using functionals determined by density probability functions and the other using the associated Markov transition operator. The ensuing diffusion equation is shown to possess triangular matrix realization. The study is completed by the incorporation of Hamiltonian dynamics in the above random walk model, and by the construction of the dynamical equation obeyed by statistical moments of the problem for generic entangled density functions.

**12.    A stronger no-cloning theorem**  
Richard Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0204153  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that (non-orthogonal) pure states cannot be cloned so one may ask: how much or what kind of additional (quantum) information is needed to supplement one copy of a quantum state in order to be able to produce two copies of that state by a physical operation? For classical information, no supplementary information is required. However for pure quantum (non-orthogonal) states, we show that the supplementary information must always be as large as it can possibly be i.e. the clone must be able to be generated from the additional information alone, independently of the first (given) copy.

**13.    Design and proof of concept for silicon-based quantum dot quantum bits**  
Mark Friesen, Paul Rugheimer, Donald E. Savage, Max G. Lagally, Daniel W. van der Weide, Robert Joynt, Mark A. Eriksson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0204035  
<blockquote>
<p>
Spins based in silicon provide one of the most promising architectures for quantum computing. Quantum dots are an inherently scalable technology. Here, we combine these two concepts into a workable design for a silicon-germanium quantum bit. The novel structure incorporates vertical and lateral tunneling, provides controlled coupling between dots, and enables single electron occupation of each dot. Precise modeling of the design elucidates its potential for scalable quantum computing. For the first time it is possible to translate the requirements of fault-tolerant error correction into specific requirements for gate voltage control electronics in quantum dots. We demonstrate that these requirements are met by existing pulse generators in the kHz-MHz range, but GHz operation is not yet achievable. Our calculations further pinpoint device features that enhance operation speed and robustness against leakage errors. We find that the component technologies for silicon quantum dot quantum computers are already in hand.

**14.    Transparency Resonances and Bound States of the $Î´^\prime$ Junction**  
P.L. Christiansen, A.V. Zolotaryuk, V.N. Ermakov, Y.B. Gaididei  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0204045  
<blockquote>
<p>
Exact positive and negative energy solutions for the eigenvalue problem of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in one dimension with a $\delta^\prime$ interaction are found and analyzed. An infinite series of transparency resonance levels in the strength of this interaction is shown to exist. This result is against the actual belief that the $\delta^\prime$ potential acts as a totally reflecting wall. A finite number of bound states is obtained, contrary to the previous result on the existence of only one bound state. A new effect of a {\it negative stepwise} drop in the electron density across the $\delta^\prime$ junction is observed. The solutions are also applied to the propagation of the electromagnetic field in dielectric media.
