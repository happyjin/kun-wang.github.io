**1.    Two examples of discrete-time quantum walks taking continuous steps**  
Alex D. Gottlieb  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310026  
<blockquote>
<p>
This note introduces some examples of quantum random walks in d-dimensional Eucilidean space and proves the weak convergence of their rescaled n-step densities. One of the examples is called the Plancherel quantum walk because the "quantum coin flip" is the Fourier Integral (or Plancherel) Transform. The other examples are the Birkhoff quantum walks, so named because the coin flips are effected by means of measure preserving transformations to which the Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem is applied.

**2.    A high-efficiency quantum non-demolition single photon number resolving detector**  
W. J. Munro, Kae Nemoto, R. G. Beausoleil, T. P. Spiller  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 033819 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310066  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss a novel approach to the problem of creating a photon number resolving detector using the giant Kerr nonlinearities available in electromagnetically induced transparency. Our scheme can implement a photon number quantum non-demolition measurement with high efficiency ($\sim$99%) using less than 1600 atoms embedded in a dielectric waveguide.

**3.    The Minimum Distance Problem for Two-Way Entanglement Purification**  
Andris Ambainis, Daniel Gottesman  
IEEE Trans. Info. Theory vol. 52, issue 2, 748-753 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310097  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement purification takes a number of noisy EPR pairs and processes them to produce a smaller number of more reliable pairs. If this is done with only a forward classical side channel, the procedure is equivalent to using a quantum error-correcting code (QECC). We instead investigate entanglement purification protocols with two-way classical side channels (2-EPPs) for finite block sizes. In particular, we consider the analog of the minimum distance problem for QECCs, and show that 2-EPPs can exceed the quantum Hamming bound and the quantum Singleton bound. We also show that 2-EPPs can achieve the rate k/n = 1 - (t/n) \log_2 3 - h(t/n) - O(1/n) (asymptotically reaching the quantum Hamming bound), where the EPP produces at least k good pairs out of n total pairs with up to t arbitrary errors, and h(x) = -x \log_2 x - (1-x) \log_2 (1-x) is the usual binary entropy. In contrast, the best known lower bound on the rate of QECCs is the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound k/n \geq 1 - (2t/n) \log_2 3 - h(2t/n). Indeed, in some regimes, the known upper bound on the asymptotic rate of good QECCs is strictly below our lower bound on the achievable rate of 2-EPPs.

**4.    Quantum Algorithms for the Triangle Problem**  
Frederic Magniez, Miklos Santha, Mario Szegedy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310134  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two new quantum algorithms that either find a triangle (a copy of $K_{3}$) in an undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes, or reject if $G$ is triangle free. The first algorithm uses combinatorial ideas with Grover Search and makes $\tilde{O}(n^{10/7})$ queries. The second algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{13/10})$ queries, and it is based on a design concept of Ambainis~\cite{amb04} that incorporates the benefits of quantum walks into Grover search~\cite{gro96}. The first algorithm uses only $O(\log n)$ qubits in its quantum subroutines, whereas the second one uses O(n) qubits. The Triangle Problem was first treated in~\cite{bdhhmsw01}, where an algorithm with $O(n+\sqrt{nm})$ query complexity was presented, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$.

**5.    Polarization phase gate with a tripod atomic system**  
S. Rebic, D. Vitali, C. Ottaviani, P. Tombesi, M. Artoni, F. Cataliotti, R. Corbalan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310148  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the nonlinear optical response of a four-level atomic system driven into a tripod configuration. The large cross-Kerr nonlinearities that occurr in such a system are shown to produce nonlinear phase shift of order $\pi$. Such a substantial shift may be observed in a cold atomic gas in a magneto-optical trap where it coupl be fasibly exploited towards the realization of a polarization quantum phase gate. The experimental feasibility of such a gate is here examined in detail.

**6.    Quantum Feedback Control of Atomic Motion in an Optical Cavity**  
Daniel A. Steck, Kurt Jacobs, Hideo Mabuchi, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Salman Habib  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004) 223004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310153  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum feedback cooling of atomic motion in an optical cavity as a prototypical nonlinear quantum control problem. We design a feedback algorithm that can cool the atom to the ground state of the optical potential with high efficiency despite the nonlinear nature of this problem. An important ingredient is a simplified state-estimation algorithm, necessary for a real-time implementation of the feedback loop. We also describe the critical role of parity dynamics in the cooling process and present a simple theory that predicts the achievable steady-state atomic energies.

**7.    Stability of quantum Fourier transformation on Ising quantum computer**  
Giuseppe Luca Celardo, Carlos Pineda, Marko ?nidari?  
International Journal of Quantum Information 3, 441-462 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310163  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the influence of errors on the implementation of the quantum Fourier transformation (QFT) on the Ising quantum computer (IQC). Two kinds of errors are studied: (i) due to spurious transitions caused by pulses and (ii) due to external perturbation. The scaling of errors with system parameters and number of qubits is explained. We use two different procedures to fight each of them. To suppress spurious transitions we use correcting pulses (generalized $2\pi k$ method) while to suppress errors due to external perturbation we use an improved QFT algorithm. As a result, the fidelity of quantum computation is increased by several orders of magnitude and is thus stable in a much wider range of physical parameters.

**8.    How much security does Y-00 protocol provide us ?**  
Tsuyoshi Nishioka, Toshio Hasegawa, Hirokazu Ishizuka, Kentaro Imafuku, Hideki Imai  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310168  
<blockquote>
<p>
New quantum cryptography, often called Y-00 protocol, has much higher performance than the conventional quantum cryptographies. It seems that the conventional quantum cryptographic attacks are inefficient at Y-00 protocol as its security is based on the different grounds from that of the conventional ones. We have, then, tried to cryptoanalyze Y-00 protocol in the view of cryptographic communication system. As a result, it turns out that the security of Y-00 protocol is equivalent to that of classical stream cipher.

**9.    Quantum random walk on the line as a markovian process**  
A. Romanelli, A.C. Sicardi-Schifino, R. Siri, G. Abal, A. Auyuanet, R. Donangelo  
Physica A Volume/Issue338/3-4 pp. 395-405 (2004).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze in detail the discrete--time quantum walk on the line by separating the quantum evolution equation into Markovian and interference terms. As a result of this separation, it is possible to show analytically that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker's position with time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution. If the evolution is decoherent, as in the classical case, the variance is shown to increase linearly with time, as expected. Furthermore we show that this system has an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor. As this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm, one may employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker.

**10.    Entanglement production by quantum error correction in the presence of correlated environment**  
G. De Chiara, R. Fazio, C. Macchiavello, G. M. Palma  
Europhys. Lett. 67, 714 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310173  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the effect of a quantum error correcting code on the entanglement of encoded logical qubits in the presence of a dephasing interaction with a correlated environment. Such correlated reservoir introduces entanglement between physical qubits. We show that for short times the quantum error correction interprets such entanglement as errors and suppresses it. However for longer time, although quantum error correction is no longer able to correct errors, it enhances the rate of entanglement production due to the interaction with the environment.

**11.    Strategies to measure a quantum state**  
Franz Embacher, Heide Narnhofer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310180  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of determining the mixed quantum state of a large but finite number of identically prepared quantum systems from data obtained in a sequence of ideal (von Neumann) measurements, each performed on an individual copy of the system. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not average over the possible unknown states but work out a ``typical'' probability distribution on the set of states, as implied by the experimental data. As a consequence, any measure of knowledge about the unknown state and thus any notion of ``best strategy'' (i.e. the choice of observables to be measured, and the number of times they are measured) depend on the unknown state. By learning from previously obtained data, the experimentalist re-adjusts the observable to be measured in the next step, eventually approaching an optimal strategy. We consider two measures of knowledge and exhibit all ``best'' strategies for the case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss some features of the problem in higher dimensions and in the infinite dimensional case.

**12.    Limit theorems and absorption problems for one-dimensional correlated random walks**  
Norio Konno  
Stochastic Models, Vol.25, Issue 1, pp.28-49 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310191  
<blockquote>
<p>
There has recently been considerable interest in quantum walks in connection with quantum computing. The walk can be considered as a quantum version of the so-called correlated random walk. We clarify a strong structural similarity between both walks and study limit theorems and absorption problems for correlated random walks by our PQRS method, which was used in our analysis of quantum walks.

**13.    Entanglement interferometry for precision measurement of atomic scattering properties**  
Artur Widera, Olaf Mandel, Markus Greiner, Susanne Kreim, Theodor W. H?nsch, Immanuel Bloch  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0310719  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a two-particle matter wave interferometer realized with pairs of trapped 87Rb atoms. Each pair of atoms is confined at a single site of an optical lattice potential. The interferometer is realized by first creating a coherent spin-mixture of the two atoms and then tuning the inter-state scattering length via a Feshbach resonance. The selective change of the inter-state scattering length leads to an entanglement dynamics of the two-particle state that can be detected in a Ramsey interference experiment. This entanglement dynamics is employed for a precision measurement of atomic interaction parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer allows to separate lattice sites with one or two atoms in a non-destructive way.

**14.    Self-dual random-plaquette gauge model and the quantum toric code**  
Koujin Takeda, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
Nucl. Phys. B686 (2004) 377-396  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0310279  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the four-dimensional Z_2 random-plaquette lattice gauge theory as a model of topological quantum memory, the toric code in particular. In this model, the procedure of quantum error correction works properly in the ordered (Higgs) phase, and phase boundary between the ordered (Higgs) and disordered (confinement) phases gives the accuracy threshold of error correction. Using self-duality of the model in conjunction with the replica method, we show that this model has exactly the same mathematical structure as that of the two dimensional random-bond Ising model, which has been studied very extensively. This observation enables us to derive a conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point (accuracy threshold) of the model, p_c=0.889972..., and leads to several nontrivial results including bounds on the accuracy threshold in three dimensions.
