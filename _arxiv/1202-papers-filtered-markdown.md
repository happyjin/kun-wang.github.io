**1.    Large deviation analysis for quantum security via smoothing of Renyi entropy of order 2**  
Masahito Hayashi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0322  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that the security evaluation can be done by smoothing of R\'{e}nyi entropy of order 2 in the classical and quantum settings when we apply universal$_2$ hash functions. Using the smoothing of Renyi entropy of order 2, we derive security bounds for $L_1$ distinguishability and modified mutual information criterion under the classical and quantum setting, and have derived these exponential decreasing rates. These results are extended to the case when we apply $\varepsilon$-almost dual universal$_2$ hash functions. Further, we apply this analysis to the secret key generation with error correction.

**2.    Observation of reduction in Casimir force without change of dielectric permittivity**  
A. A. Banishev, C.-C. Chang, R. Castillo-Garza, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko, U. Mohideen  
Int. J. Mod. Phys. A, v.27, N15, 1260001-(1-15) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0478  
<blockquote>
<p>
Additional information is provided on the effect of the significant (up to 35%) reduction in the magnitude of the Casimir force between an Au-coated sphere and an indium tin oxide film which was observed after UV treatment of the latter. A striking feature of this effect is that the reduction is not accompanied with a corresponding variation of the dielectric permittivity, as confirmed by direct ellipsometry measurements. The measurement data are compared with computations using the Lifshitz theory. It is shown that the data for the untreated sample are in a very good agreement with theory taking into account the free charge carriers in the indium tin oxide. The data for the UV-treated sample exclude the theoretical results obtained with account of free charge carriers. These data are found to be in a very good agreement with theory disregarding the free charge carriers in an indium tin oxide film. A possible theoretical explanation of our observations as a result of phase transition of indium tin oxide from metallic to dielectric state is discussed in comparison with other related experiments.

**3.    On the entropy of decoherence matrix for quantum walks**  
Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa  
Yokohama Mathematical Journal 58 (2012), 65-78  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1376  
<blockquote>
<p>
The decoherence matrix studied by Gudder and Sorkin (2011) can be considered as a map from the set of all the pairs of $n$-length paths to complex numbers, which is induced by the discrete-time quantum walk. The decoherence matrix is one of the decoherence functionals which present their historical quantum measure theory. In this paper, we compute the von Neumann entropy of the decoherence matrix. To do so, we use the result that the eigensystem of the decoherence matrix can be expressed by a corresponding correlated random walk.

**4.    Quantum Simulation of Tunneling in Small Systems**  
Andrew T. Sornborger  
Scientific Reports, 2, 597 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1536  
<blockquote>
<p>
A number of quantum algorithms have been performed on small quantum computers; these include Shor's prime factorization algorithm, error correction, Grover's search algorithm and a number of analog and digital quantum simulations. Because of the number of gates and qubits necessary, however, digital quantum particle simulations remain untested. A contributing factor to the system size required is the number of ancillary qubits needed to implement matrix exponentials of the potential operator. Here, we show that a set of tunneling problems may be investigated with no ancillary qubits and a cost of one single-qubit operator per time step for the potential evolution. We show that physically interesting simulations of tunneling using 2 qubits (i.e. on 4 lattice point grids) may be performed with 40 single and two-qubit gates. Approximately 70 to 140 gates are needed to see interesting tunneling dynamics in three-qubit (8 lattice point) simulations.

**5.    Slowing light with a coupled optomechanical crystal array**  
Zhenglu Duan, Bixuan Fan  
EPL (Europhysics Letters), 2012, 99(4): 44005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1900  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the propagation of light in a resonator optical waveguide consisting of evanescently coupled optomechanical crystal array. In the strong driving limit, the Hamiltonian of system can be linearized and diagonalized. In this case we obtain the polaritons, which is formed by the interaction of photons and the collective excitation of mechanical resonators. By analyzing the dispersion relations of polaritons, we find that the band structure can be controlled by changing the related parameters. It has been suggested an engineerable band structure can be used to slow and stop light pulses.

**6.    Super-resolving multi-photon interferences with independent light sources**  
Steffen Oppel, Thomas BÃ¼ttner, Pieter Kok, Joachim von Zanthier  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 233603 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2294  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to use multi-photon interferences from statistically independent light sources in combination with linear optical detection techniques to enhance the resolution in imaging. Experimental results with up to five independent thermal light sources confirm this approach to improve the spatial resolution. Since no involved quantum state preparation or detection is required the experiment can be considered an extension of the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment for spatial intensity correlations of order N>2.

**7.    Strongly correlated photons generated by coupling a three- or four-level system to a waveguide**  
Huaixiu Zheng, Daniel J. Gauthier, Harold U. Baranger  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 043832 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2776  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the generation of strongly correlated photons by coupling an atom to photonic quantum fields in a one-dimensional waveguide. Specifically, we consider a three-level or four-level system for the atom. Photon-photon bound states emerge as a manifestation of the strong photon-photon correlation mediated by the atom. Effective repulsive or attractive interaction between photons can be produced, causing either suppressed multiphoton transmission (photon blockade) or enhanced multiphoton transmission (photon-induced tunneling). As a result, nonclassical light sources can be generated on demand by sending coherent states into the proposed system. We calculate the second-order correlation function of the transmitted field and observe bunching and antibunching caused by the bound states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed system can produce photon pairs with a high degree of spectral entanglement, which have a large capacity for carrying information and are important for large-alphabet quantum communication.

**8.    Non-Markovianity, Loschmidt echo and criticality: a unified picture**  
Pinja Haikka, John Goold, Suzanne McEndoo, Francesco Plastina, Sabrina Maniscalco  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 060101(R) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2997  
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple relationship between recently proposed measures of non-Markovianity and the Loschmidt echo is established, holding for a two-level system (qubit) undergoing pure dephasing due to a coupling with a many-body environment. We show that the Loschmidt echo is intimately related to the information flowing out from and occasionally back into the system. This, in turn, determines the non-Markovianity of the reduced dynamics. In particular, we consider a central qubit coupled to a quantum Ising ring in the transverse field. In this context, the information flux between system and environment is strongly affected by the environmental criticality; the qubit dynamics is shown to be Markovian exactly and only at the critical point. Therefore non-Markovianity is an indicator of criticality in the model considered here.

**9.    Robust nonlocality tests with displacement-based measurements**  
Jonatan Bohr Brask, Rafael Chaves  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 010103(R) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3049  
<blockquote>
<p>
Lately, much interest has been directed towards designing setups that achieve decisive tests of local realism. Here we present Bell tests with measurements based on linear optical displacements and single-photon detection. The scheme displays good tolerance to loss. In particular, for entangled squeezed states, we find thresholds compatible with current efficiencies of detectors and sources. Furthermore, the scheme is easily extendible to any number of observers, allowing observation of multipartite nonlocality for a single photon shared among multiple modes. We also consider the case of atom-photon entanglement, where the loss threshold can be lowered further, as well as local filters compensating transmission and coupling inefficiencies at the source.

**10.    Time-convolutionless non-Markovian master equation in strong-coupling regime**  
Yang Li, Bin Luo, Jian-Wei Zhang, Hong Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3288  
<blockquote>
<p>
The time-convolutionless (TCL) non-Markovian master equation was generally thought to break down at finite time due to its singularity and fail to produce the asymptotic behavior in strong coupling regime. However, in this paper, we show that the singularity is not an obstacle for validity of the TCL master equation. Further, we propose a multiscale perturbative method valid for solving the TCL master equation in strong coupling regime, though the ordinary perturbative method invalidates therein.

**11.    No-signaling Quantum Key Distribution: Solution by Linear Programming**  
Won-Young Hwang, Joonwoo Bae, Nathan Killoran  
Quantum Information Processing 14, 687 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3822  
<blockquote>
<p>
We outline a straightforward approach for obtaining a secret key rate using only no-signaling constraints and linear programming. Assuming an individual attack, we consider all possible joint probabilities. Initially, we study only the case where Eve has binary outcomes, and we impose constraints due to the no-signaling principle and given measurement outcomes. Within the remaining space of joint probabilities, by using linear programming, we get bound on the probability of Eve correctly guessing Bob's bit. We then make use of an inequality that relates this guessing probability to the mutual information between Bob and a more general Eve, who is not binary-restricted. Putting our computed bound together with the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner formula, we obtain a positive key generation rate. The optimal value of this rate agrees with known results, but was calculated in a more straightforward way, offering the potential of generalization to different scenarios.

**12.    Optimal counterfeiting attacks and generalizations for Wiesner's quantum money**  
Abel Molina, Thomas Vidick, John Watrous  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4010  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an analysis of Wiesner's quantum money scheme, as well as some natural generalizations of it, based on semidefinite programming. For Wiesner's original scheme, it is determined that the optimal probability for a counterfeiter to create two copies of a bank note from one, where both copies pass the bank's test for validity, is (3/4)^n for n being the number of qubits used for each note. Generalizations in which other ensembles of states are substituted for the one considered by Wiesner are also discussed, including a scheme recently proposed by Pastawski, Yao, Jiang, Lukin, and Cirac, as well as schemes based on higher dimensional quantum systems. In addition, we introduce a variant of Wiesner's quantum money in which the verification protocol for bank notes involves only classical communication with the bank. We show that the optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can succeed in two independent verification attempts, given access to a single valid n-qubit bank note, is (3/4+sqrt(2)/8)^n. We also analyze extensions of this variant to higher-dimensional schemes.

**13.    Simple Non-Markovian Microscopic Models for the Depolarizing Channel of a Single Qubit**  
K. M. Fonseca Romero, R. Lo Franco  
Phys. Scr. 86 (2012) 065004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4210  
<blockquote>
<p>
The archetypal one-qubit noisy channels ---depolarizing, phase-damping and amplitude-damping channels--- describe both Markovian and non-Markovian evolution. Simple microscopic models for the depolarizing channel, both classical and quantum, are considered. Microscopic models which describe phase damping and amplitude damping channels are briefly reviewed.

**14.    System-environment correlations and Non-Markovian dynamics**  
Ansgar Pernice, Julius Helm, Walter T. Strunz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4280  
<blockquote>
<p>
We determine the total state dynamics of a dephasing open quantum system using the standard environment of harmonic oscillators. Of particular interest are random unitary approaches to the same reduced dynamics and system-environment correlations in the full model. Concentrating on a model with an at times negative dephasing rate, the issue of "non-Markovianity" will also be addressed. Crucially, given the quantum environment, the appearance of non-Markovian dynamics turns out to be accompanied by a loss of system-environment correlations. Depending on the initial purity of the qubit state, these system-environment correlations may be purely classical over the whole relevant time scale, or there may be intervals of genuine system-environment entanglement. In the latter case, we see no obvious relation between the build-up or decay of these quantum correlations and "Non-Markovianity".

**15.    High threshold error correction for the surface code**  
James R. Wootton, Daniel Loss  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4316  
<blockquote>
<p>
An algorithm is presented for error correction in the surface code quantum memory. This is shown to correct depolarizing noise up to a threshold error rate of 18.5%, exceeding previous results and coming close to the upper bound of 18.9%. The time complexity of the algorithm is found to be polynomial with error suppression, allowing efficient error correction for codes of realistic sizes.

**16.    Towards a Unified Framework for Approximate Quantum Error Correction**  
Prabha Mandayam, Hui Khoon Ng  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 012335 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5139  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent work on approximate quantum error correction (QEC) has opened up the possibility of constructing subspace codes that protect information with high fidelity in scenarios where perfect error correction is impossible. Motivated by this, we investigate the problem of approximate subsystem codes. Subsystem codes extend the standard formalism of subspace QEC to codes in which only a subsystem within a subspace of states is used to store information in a noise-resilient fashion. Here, we demonstrate easily checkable sufficient conditions for the existence of approximate subsystem codes. Furthermore, for certain classes of subsystem codes and noise processes, we prove the efficacy of the transpose channel as a simple-to-construct recovery map that works nearly as well as the optimal recovery channel. This work generalizes our earlier approach [H.K. Ng and P. Mandayam, Phys. Rev. A 81 062342 (2010)] of using the transpose channel for approximate correction of subspace codes to the case of subsystem codes, and brings us closer to a unifying framework for approximate QEC.

**17.    Quantumness beyond quantum mechanics**  
A. S. Sanz  
J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 361, 012016 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5181  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bohmian mechanics allows us to understand quantum systems in the light of other quantum traits than the well-known ones (coherence, diffraction, interference, tunneling, discreteness, entanglement, etc.). Here the discussion focusses precisely on two of these interesting aspects, which arise when quantum mechanics is though within this theoretical framework: the non-crossing property, which allows for distinguishability without erasing interference patterns, and the possibility to define quantum probability tubes, along which the probability remains constant all the way. Furthermore, taking into account this hydrodynamic-like description as a link, it is also shown how this knowledge (concepts and ideas) can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields of physics (for example, the transmission of light along waveguides).

We use quantum process tomography to characterize a full universal set of all-microwave gates on two superconducting single-frequency single-junction transmon qubits. All extracted gate fidelities, including those for Clifford group generators, single-qubit pi/4 and pi/8 rotations, and a two-qubit controlled-NOT, exceed 95% (98%), without (with) accounting for state preparation and measurement errors. Furthermore, we introduce a process map representation in the Pauli basis which is visually efficient and informative. This high-fidelity gate set serves as another critical building block towards scalable architectures of superconducting qubits for error correction schemes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5459  
<blockquote>
<p>
Scalable quantum computing can only be achieved if qubits are manipulated fault-tolerantly. Topological error correction - a novel method which combines topological quantum computing and quantum error correction - possesses the highest known tolerable error rate for a local architecture. This scheme makes use of cluster states with topological properties and requires only nearest-neighbour interactions. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of topological error correction with an eight-photon cluster state. It is shown that a correlation can be protected against a single error on any qubit, and when all qubits are simultaneously subjected to errors with equal probability, the effective error rate can be significantly reduced. This demonstrates the viability of topological error correction. Our work represents the first experimental effort to achieve fault-tolerant quantum information processing by exploring the topological properties of quantum states.

<p>
We report a superconducting artificial atom with an observed quantum coherence time of T2*=95us and energy relaxation time T1=70us. The system consists of a single Josephson junction transmon qubit embedded in an otherwise empty copper waveguide cavity whose lowest eigenmode is dispersively coupled to the qubit transition. We attribute the factor of four increase in the coherence quality factor relative to previous reports to device modifications aimed at reducing qubit dephasing from residual cavity photons. This simple device holds great promise as a robust and easily produced artificial quantum system whose intrinsic coherence properties are sufficient to allow tests of quantum error correction.

<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum error correction codes have high thresholds and are well suited to physical implementation. The minimum weight perfect matching algorithm can be used to efficiently handle errors in such codes. We perform a timing analysis of our current implementation of the minimum weight perfect matching algorithm. Our implementation performs the classical processing associated with an nxn lattice of qubits realizing a square surface code storing a single logical qubit of information in a fault-tolerant manner. We empirically demonstrate that our implementation requires only O(n^2) average time per round of error correction for code distances ranging from 4 to 512 and a range of depolarizing error rates. We also describe tests we have performed to verify that it always obtains a true minimum weight perfect matching.

We present a new approach to simulating Hamiltonian dynamics based on implementing linear combinations of unitary operations rather than products of unitary operations. The resulting algorithm has superior performance to existing simulation algorithms based on product formulas and, most notably, scales better with the simulation error than any known Hamiltonian simulation technique. Our main tool is a general method to nearly deterministically implement linear combinations of nearby unitary operations, which we show is optimal among a large class of methods.

<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a coherent mid-infrared continuum source with 700 cm-1 usable bandwidth, readily tuned within 600 - 2500 cm-1 (4 - 17 \mum) and thus covering much of the infrared "fingerprint" molecular vibration region. It is based on nonlinear frequency conversion in GaSe using a compact commercial 100-fs-pulsed Er fiber laser system providing two amplified near-infrared beams, one of them broadened by a nonlinear optical fiber. The resulting collimated mid-infrared continuum beam of 1 mW quasi-cw power represents a coherent infrared frequency comb with zero carrier-envelope phase, containing about 500,000 modes that are exact multiples of the pulse repetition rate of 40 MHz. The beam's diffraction-limited performance enables long-distance spectroscopic probing as well as maximal focusability for classical and ultraresolving near-field microscopies. Applications are foreseen also in studies of transient chemical phenomena even at ultrafast pump-probe scale, and in high-resolution gas spectroscopy for e.g. breath analysis.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many quantum systems are being investigated in the hope of building a large-scale quantum computer. All of these systems suffer from decoherence, resulting in errors during the execution of quantum gates. Quantum error correction enables reliable quantum computation given unreliable hardware. Unoptimized topological quantum error correction (TQEC), while still effective, performs very suboptimally, especially at low error rates. Hand optimizing the classical processing associated with a TQEC scheme for a specific system to achieve better error tolerance can be extremely laborious. We describe a tool Autotune capable of performing this optimization automatically, and give two highly distinct examples of its use and extreme outperformance of unoptimized TQEC. Autotune is designed to facilitate the precise study of real hardware running TQEC with every quantum gate having a realistic, physics-based error model.

<p>
We evaluate the degree of quantum correlation between two fermions (bosons) subject to continuous time quantum walks in a one-dimensional ring lattice with periodic boundary conditions. In our approach, no particle-particle interaction is considered. We show that the interference effects due to exchange symmetry can result into the appearance of non-classical correlations. The role played onto the appearance of quantum correlations by the quantum statistics of the particles, the boundary conditions, and the partition of the system is widely investigated. Quantum correlations also been investigated in a model mimicking the ballistic evolution of two indistinguishable particles in a 1D continuous space structure. Our results are consistent with recent quantum optics and electron quantum optics experiments where the showing up of two-particle non-classical correlations has been observed even in the absence of mutual interaction between the particles.

The propagation of short lightpulses in waveguiding structures with optical feedback, in our case optical microresonators, has been studied theoretically and experimentally. It appears that, dependent on the measurement set-up, ballistic transport or interference in the time domain of fs and ps laser pulses can be observed. The experiments are analyzed in terms of characteristic time scales of the source, the waveguide device and the detector arrangement and are related to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Based on this analysis a criterion is given for the upper bitrate for error free data transmission through optical microresonators.

Phys. Rev. B 85, 174304 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1614  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovian effects on the dynamics of entanglement in an exactly-solvable model that involves two independent oscillators each coupled to its own stochastic noise source. First, we develop Lie algebraic and functional integral methods to find an exact solution to the single-oscillator problem which includes an analytic expression for the density matrix and the complete statistics, i.e., the probability distribution functions for observables. For long bath time-correlations, we see non-monotonic evolution of the uncertainties in observables. Further, we extend this exact solution to the two-particle problem and find the dynamics of entanglement in a subspace. We find the phenomena of `sudden death' and `rebirth' of entanglement. Interestingly, all memory effects enter via the functional form of the energy and hence the time of death and rebirth is controlled by the amount of noisy energy added into each oscillator. If this energy increases above (decreases below) a threshold, we obtain sudden death (rebirth) of entanglement.

We analyze d-wave resonances in atom-atom scattering in the presence of harmonic confinement by employing a higher partial wave pseudopotential. Analytical results for the scattering amplitude and transmission are obtained and compared to corresponding numerical ones, which employ the Lennard-Jones potential. Qualitative agreement is observed for weak confinement. For strong confinement the pseudopotential does not capture the s- and d-wave interference phenomena yielding an asymmetric Fano profile for the transmission resonance.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 256802 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3591  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an experiment where the quantum coherence in the edge states of the integer quantum Hall regime is tuned with a decoupling gate. The coherence length is determined by measuring the visibility of quantum interferences in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a function of temperature, in the quantum Hall regime at filling factor two. The temperature dependence of the coherence length can be varied by a factor of two. The strengthening of the phase coherence at finite temperature is shown to arise from a reduction of the coupling between co-propagating edge states. This opens the way for a strong improvement of the phase coherence of Quantum Hall systems. The decoupling gate also allows us to investigate how inter-edge state coupling influence the quantum interferences' dependence on the injection bias. We find that the finite bias visibility can be decomposed into two contributions: a Gaussian envelop which is surprisingly insensitive to the coupling, and a beating component which, on the contrary, is strongly affected by the coupling.

**30.    Symmetry and localization of quantum walk induced by extra link in cycles**  
Xin-Ping Xu, Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 042327 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4208  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study the impact of single extra link on the coherent dynamics modeled by continuous-time quantum walks. For this purpose, we consider the continuous-time quantum walk on the cycle with an additional link. We find that the additional link in cycle indeed cause a very different dynamical behavior compared to the dynamical behavior on the cycle. We analytically treat this problem and calculate the Laplacian spectrum for the first time, and approximate the eigenvalues and eigenstates using the Chebyshev polynomial technique and perturbation theory. It is found that the probability evolution exhibits a similar behavior like the cycle if the exciton starts far away from the two ends of the added link. We explain this phenomenon by the eigenstate of the largest eigenvalue. We prove symmetry of the long-time averaged probabilities using the exact determinant equation for the eigenvalues expressed by Chebyshev polynomials. In addition, there is a significant localization when the exciton starts at one of the two ends of the extra link, we show that the localized probability is determined by the largest eigenvalue and there is a significant lower bound for it even in the limit of infinite system. Finally, we study the problem of trapping and show the survival probability also displays significant localization for some special values of network parameters, and we determine the conditions for the emergence of such localization. All our findings suggest that the different dynamics caused by the extra link in cycle is mainly determined by the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenstate. We hope the Laplacian spectral analysis in this work provides a deeper understanding for the dynamics of quantum walks on networks.

<blockquote>
<p>
Large cross-section GaN waveguides are proposed as a suitable architecture to achieve integrated quantum photonic circuits. Directional couplers with this geometry have been designed with aid of the beam propagation method and fabricated using inductively coupled plasma etching. Scanning electron microscopy inspection shows high quality facets for end coupling and a well defined gap between rib pairs in the coupling region. Optical characterization at 800 nm shows single-mode operation and coupling-length-dependent splitting ratios. Two photon interference of degenerate photon pairs has been observed in the directional coupler by measurement of the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip with 96% visibility.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a superconducting quantum point contact in a circuit quantum electrodynamics setup. We study three different configurations, attainable with current technology, where a quantum point contact is coupled galvanically to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes can be achieved with realistic parameters, allowing the coherent exchange between a superconducting quantum point contact and a quantized intracavity field.

<blockquote>
<p>
The concept of valence bond resonance plays a fundamental role in the theory of the chemical bond and is believed to lie at the heart of many-body quantum physical phenomena. Here we show direct experimental evidence of a time-resolved valence bond quantum resonance with ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. By means of a superlattice structure we create a three-dimensional array of independent four-site plaquettes, which we can fully control and manipulate in parallel. Moreover, we show how small-scale plaquette resonating valence bond states with s- and d-wave symmetry can be created and characterized. We anticipate our findings to open the path towards the creation and analysis of many-body RVB states in ultracold atomic gases.
