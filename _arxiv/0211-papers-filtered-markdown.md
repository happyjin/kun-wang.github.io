**1.    Quantum Markov Channels for Qubits**  
Sonja Daffer, Krzysztof Wodkiewicz, John K. McIver  
PRA 67, 062312 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211001  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine stochastic maps in the context of quantum optics. Making use of the master equation, the damping basis, and the Bloch picture we calculate a non-unital, completely positive, trace-preserving map with unequal damping eigenvalues. This results in what we call the squeezed vacuum channel. A geometrical picture of the effect of stochastic noise on the set of pure state qubit density operators is provided. Finally, we study the capacity of the squeezed vacuum channel to transmit quantum information and to distribute EPR states.

**2.    Implementation of dense coding using the generalized Grover's algorithm**  
Jingfu Zhang, Zhiheng Lu, Lu Shan, Zhiwei Deng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211004  
<blockquote>
<p>
Dense coding has been implemented using the generalized Grover's algorithm and its inverse operation. Exploiting the superpositions of two Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, messages that are possible to be transmitted increase. Our scheme is demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Experimental results show a good agreement between theory and experiment.

**3.    Efficient implementations of the Quantum Fourier Transform: an experimental perspective**  
Kavita Dorai, Dieter Suter  
Intl. J. Qtm. Info. , Vol. 3, 413 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211030  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a key ingredient in most quantum algorithms. We have compared various spin-based quantum computing schemes to implement the QFT from the point of view of their actual time-costs and the accuracy of the implementation. We focus here on an interesting decomposition of the QFT as a product of the non-selective Hadamard transformation followed by multiqubit gates corresponding to square- and higher-roots of controlled-NOT gates. This decomposition requires only O(n) operations and is thus linear in the number of qubits $n$. The schemes were implemented on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor and the resultant density matrices reconstructed using standard quantum state tomography techniques. Their experimental fidelities have been measured and compared.

**4.    Quantum Computations with Optical Waveguide Modes**  
Jian Fu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211038  
<blockquote>
<p>
A fully optical method to perform any quantum computation with optical waveguide modes is proposed by supplying the prescriptions for a universal set of quantum gates. The proposal for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two normal modes of multi-mode waveguides. The proposed universal set of gates has the potential of being more compact and easily realized than other optical implementations, since it is based on planar lightwave circuit technology and can be constructed by using Mach-Zehnder interferometer configurations having semiconductor optical amplifiers with very high refractive nonlinearity in their arms.

**5.    Quantum Error Models and Error Mitigation for Long-Distance Teleportation Architectures**  
Jeffrey H. Shapiro, Joe Aung, Brent J. Yen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211086  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum communication architecture is being developed for long-distance, high-fidelity qubit teleportation. It uses an ultrabright narrowband source of polarization-entangled photons, plus trapped-atom quantum memories, and it is compatible with long-distance transmission over standard telecommunication fiber. This paper reports error models for the preceding teleportation architecture, and for an extension thereto which enables long-distance transmission and storage of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The use of quantum error correction or entanglement purification to improve the performance of these quantum communication architectures is also discussed.

**6.    Hidden Translation and Translating Coset in Quantum Computing**  
K. Friedl, G. Ivanyos, F. Magniez, M. Santha, P. Sen  
SIAM Journal on Computing 43:1 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211091  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give efficient quantum algorithms for the problems of Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup in a large class of non-abelian solvable groups including solvable groups of constant exponent and of constant length derived series. Our algorithms are recursive. For the base case, we solve efficiently Hidden Translation in $\Z_{p}^{n}$, whenever $p$ is a fixed prime. For the induction step, we introduce the problem Translating Coset generalizing both Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup, and prove a powerful self-reducibility result: Translating Coset in a finite solvable group $G$ is reducible to instances of Translating Coset in $G/N$ and $N$, for appropriate normal subgroups $N$ of $G$. Our self-reducibility framework combined with Kuperberg's subexponential quantum algorithm for solving Hidden Translation in any abelian group, leads to subexponential quantum algorithms for Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup in any solvable group.

**7.    Classical Concepts in Quantum Programming**  
Bernhard Oemer  
International Journal of Theoretical Physics 44/7, pp. 943-955, 2005.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211100  
<blockquote>
<p>
The rapid progress of computer technology has been accompanied by a corresponding evolution of software development, from hardwired components and binary machine code to high level programming languages, which allowed to master the increasing hardware complexity and fully exploit its potential. This paper investigates, how classical concepts like hardware abstraction, hierarchical programs, data types, memory management, flow of control and structured programming can be used in quantum computing. The experimental language QCL will be introduced as an example, how elements like irreversible functions, local variables and conditional branching, which have no direct quantum counterparts, can be implemented, and how non-classical features like the reversibility of unitary transformation or the non-observability of quantum states can be accounted for within the framework of a procedural programming language.

**8.    Mixed quantum state detection with inconclusive results**  
Yonina C. Eldar  
Phys. Rev. A. 67, 042309 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211121  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of designing an optimal quantum detector with a fixed rate of inconclusive results that maximizes the probability of correct detection, when distinguishing between a collection of mixed quantum states. We develop a sufficient condition for the scaled inverse measurement to maximize the probability of correct detection for the case in which the rate of inconclusive results exceeds a certain threshold. Using this condition we derive the optimal measurement for linearly independent pure-state sets, and for mixed-state sets with a broad class of symmetries. Specifically, we consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets and compound geometrically uniform (CGU) state sets with generators that satisfy a certain constraint. We then show that the optimal measurements corresponding to GU and CGU state sets with arbitrary generators are also GU and CGU respectively, with generators that can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time within any desired accuracy by solving a semidefinite programming problem.

**9.    The Hidden Subgroup Problem in Affine Groups: Basis Selection in Fourier Sampling**  
Cristopher Moore, Daniel Rockmore, Alexander Russell, Leonard Schulman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211124  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many quantum algorithms, including Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a hidden subgroup problem, in which a subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a quantum state y uniformly supported on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are then solved by Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and measured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of the Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method, where only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can be reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known, method. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show that hidden subgroups of semidirect products of Z_p by Z_q, where q divides (p-1) and q = p / polylog(p), can be efficiently determined by the strong standard method. Furthermore, the weak standard method and the ``forgetful'' Abelian method are insufficient for these groups. We extend this to an information-theoretic solution for the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect products of Z_p by \Z_q where q divides (p-1) and, in particular, the Affine groups A_p. Finally, we prove a closure property for the class of groups over which the hidden subgroup problem can be solved efficiently.

**10.    Quantum Algorithms for some Hidden Shift Problems**  
Wim van Dam, Sean Hallgren, Lawrence Ip  
Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pages 489-498 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211140  
<blockquote>
<p>
Almost all of the most successful quantum algorithms discovered to date exploit the ability of the Fourier transform to recover subgroup structure of functions, especially periodicity. The fact that Fourier transforms can also be used to capture shift structure has received far less attention in the context of quantum computation. In this paper, we present three examples of ``unknown shift'' problems that can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer using the quantum Fourier transform. We also define the hidden coset problem, which generalizes the hidden shift problem and the hidden subgroup problem. This framework provides a unified way of viewing the ability of the Fourier transform to capture subgroup and shift structure.

**11.    Controllability properties for finite dimensional quantum Markovian master equations**  
C. Altafini  
J. Math. Phys., 44(6):2357-2372, 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211194  
<blockquote>
<p>
Various notions from geometric control theory are used to characterize the behavior of the Markovian master equation for N-level quantum mechanical systems driven by unitary control and to describe the structure of the sets of reachable states. It is shown that the system can be accessible but neither small-time controllable nor controllable in finite time. In particular, if the generators of quantum dynamical semigroups are unital, then the reachable sets admit easy characterizations as they monotonically grow in time. The two level case is treated in detail.

**12.    Density matrix operatorial solution of the non--Markovian Master Equation for Quantum Brownian Motion**  
F. Intravaia, S. Maniscalco, A. Messina  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 042108 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211196  
<blockquote>
<p>
An original method to exactly solve the non-Markovian Master Equation describing the interaction of a single harmonic oscillator with a quantum environment in the weak coupling limit is reported. By using a superoperatorial approach we succeed in deriving the operatorial solution for the density matrix of the system. Our method is independent of the physical properties of the environment. We show the usefulness of our solution deriving explicit expressions for the dissipative time evolution of some observables of physical interest for the system, such as, for example, its mean energy.

**13.    A geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation**  
Y. Jack Ng, H. van Dam  
Phys.Lett. A309 (2003) 335-339  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0211002  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation by considering a spin-1/2 particle travelling with the speed of light in a cubic spacetime lattice. The mass of the particle acts to flip the multi-component wavefunction at the lattice sites. Starting with a difference equation for the case of one spatial and one time dimensions, we generalize the approach to higher dimensions. Interactions with external electromagnetic and gravitational fields are also considered. One logical interpretation is that only at the lattice sites is the spin-1/2 particle aware of its mass and the presence of external fields.
