**1.    Quantum fast Fourier transform using multilevel atoms**  
Ashok Muthukrishnan, C. R. Stroud Jr  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112017  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an implementation of the quantum fast Fourier transform algorithm in an entangled system of multilevel atoms. The Fourier transform occurs naturally in the unitary time evolution of energy eigenstates and is used to define an alternate wave-packet basis for quantum information in the atom. A change of basis from energy levels to wave packets amounts to a discrete quantum Fourier transform within each atom. The algorithm then reduces to a series of conditional phase transforms between two entangled atoms in mixed energy and wave-packet bases. We show how to implement such transforms using wave-packet control of the internal states of the ions in the linear ion-trap scheme for quantum computing.

**2.    Continuous variable teleportation of single photon states (Proceedings version)**  
Toshiki Ide, Holger F. Hofmann, Takayoshi Kobayashi, Akira Furusawa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112018  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the changes to a single photon state caused by the non-maximal entanglement in continuous variable quantum teleportation. It is shown that the teleportation measurement introduces field coherence in the output.

**3.    Entanglement in the Dicke model**  
S. Schneider, G.J. Milburn  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112042  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how an ion trap, configured for the coherent manipulation of external and internal quantum states, can be used to simulate the irreversible dynamics of a collective angular momentum model known as the Dicke model. In the special case of two ions, we show that entanglement is created in the coherently driven steady state with linear driving. For the case of more than two ions we calculate the entanglement between two ions in the steady state of the Dicke model by tracing over all the other ions. The entanglement in the steady state is a maximum for the parameter values corresponding roughly to a bifurcation of a fixed point in the corresponding semiclassical dynamics. We conjecture that this is a general mechanism for entanglement creation in driven dissipative quantum systems.

**4.    Linear Optical CNOT Gate in the Coincidence Basis**  
T. C. Ralph, N. K. Langford, T. B. Bell, A. G. White  
Physical Review A 65, 062324 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112088  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe the operation and tolerances of a non-deterministic, coincidence basis, quantum CNOT gate for photonic qubits. It is constructed solely from linear optical elements and requires only a two-photon source for its demonstration.

**5.    An entanglement monotone derived from Grover's algorithm**  
Ofer Biham, Michael A. Nielsen, Tobias J. Osborne  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112097  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper demonstrates that how well a state performs as an input to Grover's search algorithm depends critically upon the entanglement present in that state; the more entanglement, the less well the algorithm performs. More precisely, suppose we take a pure state input, and prior to running the algorithm apply local unitary operations to each qubit in order to maximize the probability P_max that the search algorithm succeeds. We prove that, for pure states, P_max is an entanglement monotone, in the sense that P_max can never be decreased by local operations and classical communication.

**6.    Approximate quantum error correction**  
Benjamin Schumacher, Michael D. Westmoreland  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112106  
<blockquote>
<p>
The errors that arise in a quantum channel can be corrected perfectly if and only if the channel does not decrease the coherent information of the input state. We show that, if the loss of coherent information is small, then approximate error correction is possible.

**7.    Photoconductance Quantization in a Single-Photon Detector**  
Hideo Kosaka, Deepak S. Rao, Hans D. Robinson, Prabhakar Bandaru, Toshitsugu Sakamoto, Eli Yablonovitch  
Phys. Rev. B 65, R201307 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112125  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have made a single-photon detector that relies on photoconductive gain in a narrow electron channel in an AlGaAs/GaAs 2-dimensional electron gas. Given that the electron channel is 1-dimensional, the photo-induced conductance has plateaus at multiples of the quantum conductance 2e$^{2}$/h. Super-imposed on these broad conductance plateaus are many sharp, small, conductance steps associated with single-photon absorption events that produce individual photo-carriers. This type of photoconductive detector could measure a single photon, while safely storing and protecting the spin degree of freedom of its photo-carrier. This function is valuable for a quantum repeater that would allow very long distance teleportation of quantum information.

**8.    Error correction code for protecting three-qubit quantum information against erasures**  
Chui-Ping Yang, Shih-I Chu, Siyuan Han  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112141  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum error correction code which protects three quantum bits (qubits) of quantum information against one erasure, i.e., a single-qubit arbitrary error at a known position. To accomplish this, we encode the original state by distributing quantum information over six qubits which is the minimal number for the present task (see reference [1]). The encoding and error recovery operations for such a code are presented. It is noted that the present code is also a three-qubit quantum hidded information code over each qubit. In addition, an encoding scheme for hiding $n$-qubit quantum information over each qubit is proposed.
