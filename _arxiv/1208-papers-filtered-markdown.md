**1.    Stochastic Variational Method as Quantization Scheme I: Hamiltonian Form and Uncertainty Relation**  
T. Koide, T. Kodama  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0258  
<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) is the generalization of the variation method to the case with stochastic variables. In this series of papers, we investigate the applicability of SVM as an alternative quantization scheme. In Part I, we discuss the formulation of the uncertainty relation in SVM by developing the Hamiltonian form of SVM. We further study that our formulation is applicable to define the uncertainty relation in a quantum dissipative process described by the Kostin equation and show that this minimum uncertainty relation does not disappear in the asymptotic limit of time.

**2.    Realization of the driven nonlinear Schr?dinger equation with stationary light**  
Priyam Das, Changsuk Noh, Dimitris G. Angelakis  
Europhys. Lett. 103 (2013) 34001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0313  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a versatile platform for studying nonlinear out-of-equilibrium physics. The platform is based on a slow light setup where an optical waveguide is interfaced with cold atoms to realize the driven nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a potential. We compare the proposed setup with similar setups using Bose-Einstein condensates and investigate the system's response under coherent driving for a lattice potential. The slow light setup provides novel angles in the study of nonlinear dynamics due to its advantages in introducing and modulating the driving, the extra tunability over the sign and strength of the available nonlinearities, and the possibility to electromagnetically carve out the underlying potential on demand.

**3.    Quantum random walk : effect of quenching**  
Sanchari Goswami, Parongama Sen  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 022314 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0424  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of quenching on a discrete quantum random walk by removing a detector placed at a position $x_D$ abruptly at time $t_R$ from its path. The results show that this may lead to an enhancement of the occurrence probability at $x_D$ provided the time of removal $t_R < t_{R}^{lim}$ where $t_{R}^{lim}$ scales as $x_D{^2}$. The ratio of the occurrence probabilities for a quenched walker ($t_R \neq 0$) and free walker ($t_R =0$) shows that it scales as $1/t_R$ at large values of $t_R$ independent of $x_D$. On the other hand if $t_R$ is fixed this ratio varies as $x_{D}^{2}$ for small $x_D$. The results are compared to the classical case. We also calculate the correlations as functions of both time and position.

**4.    Local random quantum circuits are approximate polynomial-designs**  
Fernando G. S. L. Brandao, Aram W. Harrow, Michal Horodecki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0692  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed of polynomially many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate unitary poly(n)-design. Previously it was unknown whether random quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic entries, are infinity-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of small depth and prove they constitute a quantum poly(n)-copy tensor-product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov et al. We give three applications of the results. First we show that almost every circuit U of size n^k on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size n^[(k+3)/6] that are given oracle access to U; this provides a data-hiding scheme against computationally bounded adversaries. Second we reconsider a recent argument of Masanes et al concerning local equilibration of time-evolving quantum systems, and strengthen the connection between fast equilibration of small subsystems and the circuit complexity of the Hamiltonian. Third we show that in one dimension almost every parallel local circuit of linear depth generates topological order, matching an upper bound to the problem due to Bravyi et al.

**5.    From Classical Four-Wave Mixing to Parametric Fluorescence in Silicon micro-ring resonators**  
Stefano Azzini, Davide Grassani, Matteo Galli, Lucio Claudio Andreani, Marc Sorel, Michael J. Strain, L. G. Helt, J. E. Sipe, Marco Liscidini, Daniele Bajoni  
Optics Letters, Vol. 37 Issue 18, pp.3807-3809 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0765  
<blockquote>
<p>
Four-wave mixing can be stimulated or occur spontaneously. The first process is intrinsically much stronger, and well understood through classical nonlinear optics. The latter, also known as parametric fluorescence, can be explained only in the framework of a quantum theory of light. We experimentally demonstrate that, in a micro-ring resonator, there exists a simple relation between the efficiencies of these two processes, which is independent of the nonlinearity and size of the ring. In particular we show that the average power generated by parametric fluorescence can be immediately estimated from a classical FWM experiment. These results suggest that classical nonlinear characterization of a photonic integrated structure can provide accurate information on its nonlinear quantum properties.

**6.    Dynamics of spontaneous emission in a single-end photonic waveguide**  
T. Tufarelli, F. Ciccarello, M. S. Kim  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 013820 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0969  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system, e.g. an atom or atomlike object, coupled to a single-end, i.e., semi-infinite, one-dimensional photonic waveguide such that one end behaves as a perfect mirror while light can pass through the opposite end with no back-reflection. Through a quantum microscopic model we show that such geometry can cause non-exponential and long-lived atomic decay. Under suitable conditions, a bound atom-photon stationary state appears in the atom-mirror interspace so as to trap a considerable amount of initial atomic excitation. Yet, this can be released by applying an atomic frequency shift causing a revival of photon emission. The resilience of such effects to typical detrimental factors is analyzed.

**7.    Realization of the probability laws in the quantum central limit theorems by a quantum walk**  
Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1005  
<blockquote>
<p>
Since a limit distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on the line was derived in 2002, a lot of limit theorems for quantum walks with a localized initial state have been reported. On the other hand, in quantum probability theory, there are four notions of independence (free, monotone, commuting, and boolean independence) and quantum central limit theorems associated to each independence have been investigated. The relation between quantum walks and quantum probability theory is still unknown. As random walks are fundamental models in the Kolmogorov probability theory, can the quantum walks play an important role in quantum probability theory? To discuss this problem, we focus on a discrete-time 2-state quantum walk with a non-localized initial state and present a limit theorem. By using our limit theorem, we generate probability laws in the quantum central limit theorems from the quantum walk.

**8.    Optimal quantum query bounds for almost all Boolean functions**  
Andris Ambainis, Arturs Backurs, Juris Smotrovs, Ronald de Wolf  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1122  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that almost all n-bit Boolean functions have bounded-error quantum query complexity at least n/2, up to lower-order terms. This improves over an earlier n/4 lower bound of Ambainis, and shows that van Dam's oracle interrogation is essentially optimal for almost all functions. Our proof uses the fact that the acceptance probability of a T-query algorithm can be written as the sum of squares of degree-T polynomials.

**9.    Two-photon transport through a waveguide coupling to a whispering gallery resonator containing an atom and photon-blockade effect**  
T. Shi, Shanhui Fan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1258  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the two-photon transport through a waveguide side-coupling to a whispering-gallery-atom system. Using the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) reduction approach, we present the general formula for the two-photon processes including the two-photon scattering matrices, the wavefunctions and the second order correlation functions of the out-going photons. Based on the exact results of the second order correlation functions, we analyze the quantum statistics behaviors of the out-going photons for two different cases: (a) the ideal case without the inter-modal coupling in the whispering gallery resonator; (b) the case in the presence of the inter-modal coupling which leads to more complex nonlinear behavior. In the ideal case, we show that the system consists of two independent scattering pathways, a free pathway by a cavity mode without atomic excitation, and a "Jaynes-Cummings" pathway described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of a single-mode cavity coupling to an atom. The free pathway does not contribution to correlated two-photon processes. In the presence of intermodal mixing, the system no longer exhibit a free resonant pathway. Instead, both the single-photon and the two photon transport properties depend on the position of the atom. Thus, in the presence of intermodal mixing one can in fact tune the photon correlation properties by changing the position of the atom. Our formalism can be used to treat resonator and cavity dissipation as well.

**10.    Entanglement of two superconducting qubits in a waveguide cavity via monochromatic two-photon excitation**

Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 240505 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1287  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report a system where fixed interactions between non-computational levels make bright the otherwise forbidden two-photon 00 --> 11 transition. The system is formed by hand selection and assembly of two discrete component transmon-style superconducting qubits inside a rectangular microwave cavity. The application of a monochromatic drive tuned to this transition induces two-photon Rabi-like oscillations between the ground and doubly-excited states via the Bell basis. The system therefore allows all-microwave two-qubit universal control with the same techniques and hardware required for single qubit control. We report Ramsey-like and spin echo sequences with the generated Bell states, and measure a two-qubit gate fidelity of 90% (unconstrained) and 86% (maximum likelihood estimator).

**11.    Analytic asymptotic performance of topological codes**  
Austin G. Fowler  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 040301(R) (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1334  
<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum error correction codes are extremely practical, typically requiring only a 2-D lattice of qubits with tunable nearest neighbor interactions yet tolerating high physical error rates p. It is computationally expensive to simulate the performance of such codes at low p, yet this is a regime we wish to study as low physical error rates lead to low qubit overhead. We present a very general method of analytically estimating the low p performance of the most promising class of topological codes. Our method can handle arbitrary periodic quantum circuits implementing the error detection associated with this class of codes, and arbitrary Pauli error models for each type of quantum gate. Our analytic expressions take only seconds to obtain, versus hundreds of hours to perform equivalent low p simulations.

Bi-Heng Liu, Dong-Yang Cao, Yun-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Elsi-Mari Laine, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Jyrki Piilo  
Scientific Reports 3, 1781 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1358  
<blockquote>
<p>
The study of open quantum systems is important for fundamental issues of quantum physics as well as for technological applications such as quantum information processing. Recent developments in this field have increased our basic understanding on how non-Markovian effects influence the dynamics of an open quantum system, paving the way to exploit memory effects for various quantum control tasks. Most often, the environment of an open system is thought to act as a sink for the system information. However, here we demonstrate experimentally that a photonic open system can exploit the information initially held by its environment. Correlations in the environmental degrees of freedom induce nonlocal memory effects where the bipartite open system displays, counterintuitively, local Markovian and global non-Markovian character. Our results also provide novel methods to protect and distribute entanglement, and to experimentally quantify correlations in photonic environments.

**13.    Enhanced quantum teleportation in non-Markovian environments**  
Xiang Hao, Shiqun Zhu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1550  
<blockquote>
<p>
The protocol of the teleportation of an arbitrary unknown one-qubit state is investigated when the quantum channel is subject to the decoherence from the non-Markovian environments with the memory effects. The quality of the teleportation measured by the average fidelity and minimal fidelity can be enhanced in the non-Markovian channel. The memory effects give rise to the revival of the fidelity which is better than that obtained by the Markovian channel.

**14.    Dynamics of quantum discord in asymmetric and local non-Markovian environments**  
Xiang Hao, Tao Pan, Jinqiao Sha  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1554  
<blockquote>
<p>
The non-Markovian decoherence of quantum and classical correlations is analytically obtained when two qubits are asymmetrically subjected to the bit flip channel and phase flip channel. For one class of initial mixed states, quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord decay synchronously with classical correlations. The discovery that the decaying rates of quantum and classical correlations suddenly change at the characteristic time is physically interpreted by the distance from quantum state to the closest classical states. In a large time interval, quantum correlations are greater than classical correlations. The quantum and classical correlations can be preserved over a longer period of time via the kernel characterizing the environment memory effects.

Andrea Chiuri, Chiara Greganti, Laura Mazzola, Mauro Paternostro, Paolo Mataloni  
Scientific Reports 2, 968 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1630  
<blockquote>
<p>
The simulation of quantum processes is a key goal for the grand programme aiming at grounding quantum technologies as the way to explore complex phenomena that are inaccessible through standard, classical calculators. Some interesting steps have been performed in this direction and this scenario has recently been extended to open quantum evolutions, marking the possibility to investigate important features of the way a quantum system interacts with its environment. Here we demonstrate experimentally the (non-)Markovianity of a process where system and environment are coupled through a simulated transverse Ising model. By engineering the evolution in a fully controlled photonic quantum simulator, we assess and demonstrate the role that system-environment correlations have in the emergence of memory effects.

**16.    Quantum walk as a generalized measuring device**  
Pawel Kurzynski, Antoni Wojcik  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 200404 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1800  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a one-dimensional discrete time quantum walk can be used to implement a generalized measurement in terms of positive operator value measure (POVM) on a single qubit. More precisely, we show that for a single qubit any set of rank 1 and rank 2 POVM elements can be generated by a properly engineered quantum walk. In such a scenario the measurement of particle at position x=i corresponds to a measurement of a POVM element E_i on a qubit. We explicitly construct quantum walks implementing unambiguous state discrimination and SIC-POVM.

Phys. Rev. A 86, 042328 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1815  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum receiver is an important tool for overcoming the standard quantum limit (SQL) of discrimination errors in optical communication. We theoretically study the quantum receivers for discriminating ternary and quaternary phase shift keyed coherent states in terms of average error rate and mutual information. Our receiver consists of on/off-type photon detectors and displacement operations w/o electrical feedforward operations. We show that for the ternary signals, the receiver shows a reasonable gain from the SQL even without feedforward. This scheme is realizable with the currently available technology. For the quaternary signals feedforward operation is crucial to overcome the SQL with imperfect devices. We also analytically examine the asymptotic limit of the performance of the proposed receiver with respect to the number of feedforward steps.

**18.    Massless Dirac particle in a stochastic magnetic field: A solvable quantum walk approximation**  
A. J. Bracken, D. Ellinas, I. Smyrnakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2082  
<blockquote>
<p>
A massless Dirac particle is considered, moving along the x-axis while Pauli-coupled by its anomalous magnetic moment to a piecewise constant magnetic field along the same axis, with stochastically varying sign. The motion is approximated as a quantum walk with unitary noise, for which the evolution can be found exactly. Initially ballistic, the motion approaches a classical diffusion on a time-scale determined by the speed of light, the size of the magnetic moment, the strength of the field and the time interval between changes in its direction. It is suggested that a process of this type could occur in the Sun's corona, significantly affecting the solar fluxes of one or more neutrino types.

**19.    Quantum-correlation breaking channels, broadcasting scenarios, and finite Markov chains**  
J. K. Korbicz, P. Horodecki, R. Horodecki  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 042319 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2162  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the classical results concerning quantum channels is the characterization of entanglement-breaking channels [M. Horodecki et al., Rev. Math. Phys 15, 629 (2003)]. We address the question whether there exists a similar characterization on the level of quantum correlations which may go beyond entanglement. The answer is fully affirmative in the case of breaking quantum correlations down to the, so called, CQ (Classical-Quantum) type, and the corresponding channels turn out to be measurement maps, while it is no longer true in the CC (Classical-Classical) case. The study of the latter reveals an unexpected link between quantum state and local correlation broadcasting and finite Markov chains. We present a possibility of broadcasting via non von Neumann measurements, which relies on the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. Surprisingly, this is not the typical generalized C-NOT gate scenario, appearing naturally in this context.

**20.    Super-stable tomography of any linear optical device**  
Anthony Laing, Jeremy L. O'Brien  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2868  
<blockquote>
<p>
Linear optical circuits of growing complexity are playing an increasing role in emerging photonic quantum technologies. Individual photonic devices are typically described by a unitary matrix containing amplitude and phase information, the characterisation of which is a key task. We present a constructive scheme to retrieve the unitary matrix describing an arbitrary linear optical device using data obtained from one-photon and two-photon ensembles. The scheme is stable on the arbitrarily increasable length scale of the photon packet and independent of photon loss at input and output ports of the device. We find a one-to-one correspondence between ideal data and unitary matrix, and identify the class of non-unitary matrices capable of reproducing the data. The method is extended for coherent state probes, which can simulate two-photon statistics with a reduced visibility. We analyse the performance of reconstruction to simulated noise.

**21.    Nonlinear Optics Quantum Computing with Circuit-QED**  
Prabin Adhikari, Mohammad Hafezi, J. M. Taylor  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 060503, 2013  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2960  
<blockquote>
<p>
One approach to quantum information processing is to use photons as quantum bits and rely on linear optical elements for most operations. However, some optical nonlinearity is necessary to enable universal quantum computing. Here, we suggest a circuit-QED approach to nonlinear optics quantum computing in the microwave regime, including a deterministic two-photon phase gate. Our specific example uses a hybrid quantum system comprising a LC resonator coupled to a superconducting flux qubit to implement a nonlinear coupling. Compared to the self-Kerr nonlinearity, we find that our approach has improved tolerance to noise in the qubit while maintaining fast operation.

Iaakov Exman, Efrat Levy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3905  
<blockquote>
<p>
Distributed computing seems to be a natural approach to overcome size limitations of quantum computers in terms of number of qubits. But one lacks an efficient distribution approach to deal systematically with potential algorithms. This work proposes suitable quantum probes to reduce measurements in distributed sub-systems. Probes are introduced in the context of distributed Grover search. These are shown to be indeed efficient. The latter can be generalized to be applicable to other distributed algorithms of interest.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the context of quantum state engineering we analyze the effect of observation on nonlinear optical $n$-photon Fock state generation. We show that it is possible to truncate the vacuum component from an arbitrary photon number superposition without modifying its remaining parts. In the course of the full dynamical analysis of the effect of observation, it is also found that the Zeno and the anti-Zeno effects repeat periodically. We discuss the close relationship between vacuum state truncation and so-called "interaction-free" measurement.

Quantum mechanics still provides new unexpected effects when considering the transport of energy and information. Models of continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonians, have been intensely used to investigate the effectiveness of transport. Here we show how breaking time-reversal symmetry of the unitary dynamics in this model can enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of quantum transport. Examples ranging from exciton transport to complex networks are presented. This opens new prospects for more efficient methods to transport energy and information.

Zeyang Liao, M. Al-Amri, M. Suhail Zubairy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4187  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum entanglement is a critical resource for quantum information and quantum computation. However, entanglement of a quantum system is subjected to change due to the interaction with the environment. One typical result of the interaction is the amplitude damping that usually results in the reduction of the entanglement. Here we propose a protocol to protect quantum entanglement from the amplitude damping by applying Hadamard and CNOT gates. As opposed to some recently studied methods, the scheme presented here does not require weak measurement in the reversal process, leading to a faster recovery of entanglement. We propose a possible experimental implementation based on linear optical system.

Quantum input-output response analysis is a useful method for modeling the dynamics of complex quantum networks, such as those for communication or quantum control via cascade connections. Non-Markovian effects have not yet been studied in such networks. Here we extend the Markovian input-output network formalism developed in optical systems to non-Markovian cascaded networks which can be used, e.g., to analyze the input-output response of mesoscopic quantum networks. We use this formalism to explore the behavior of superconducting qubit networks, where we examine the effect of finite cavity bandwidths. We also discuss its application to open- and closed-loop control networks, and show how these networks create effective Hamiltonians for the controlled system.

<p>
Large-scale universal quantum computing requires the implementation of quantum error correction (QEC).

We perform quantum process tomography of the encoded gate operations, demonstrate the successful correction of all possible single qubit errors and measure the fidelity of the encoded logical gate operations.

Yuting Ping, John H. Jefferson, Brendon W. Lovett  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4828  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the state of a flying qubit may be transferred to a chain of identical, (near) ferromagnetically polarised, but non-interacting, static spin-1/2 particles in a passive way. During this process the flying qubit is coherently polarised, emerging in the direction of the majority static spins. We also show that this process is reversible for at least two flying qubits injected sequentially and thus has the potential to be exploited as a passive quantum memory to encode the flying qubits without the necessity of resetting between successive encoding operations. We show that the quantum information may be spread over many static spins in the memory chain, making the mechanism resistent to spin decoherence and other imperfections. Among some potential architectures, we discuss implementing the memory in a photonic waveguide embedded with quantum dots, which is resilient to various possible errors.

<p>
Quantum codes are subspaces of the state space of a quantum system that are used to protect quantum information. Some common classes of quantum codes are stabilizer (or additive) codes, non-stabilizer (or non-additive) codes obtained from stabilizer codes, and Clifford codes. These are analyzed in a framework using the Fourier transform on finite groups, the finite group in question being a subgroup of the quantum error group considered. All the classes of codes that can be obtained in this framework are explored, including codes more general than Clifford codes. The error detection properties of one of these more general classes ("direct sums of translates of Clifford codes") are characterized. Examples codes are constructed, and computer code search results presented and analysed.

**31.    The Implications of Ignorance for Quantum Error Correction Thresholds**  
Alastair Kay  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 032328 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4924  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correcting codes have a distance parameter, conveying the minimum number of single spin errors that could cause error correction to fail. However, the success thresholds of finite per-qubit error rate that have been proven for the likes of the Toric code require them to work well beyond this limit. We argue that without the assumption of being below the distance limit, the success of error correction is not only contingent on the noise model, but what the noise model is believed to be. Any discrepancy must adversely affect the threshold rate, and risks invalidating existing threshold theorems. We prove that for the 2D Toric code, suitable thresholds still exist by utilising a mapping to the 2D random bond Ising model.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a state discrimination problem which deals with settings of minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination systematically by introducing a margin for the probability of an incorrect guess. We analyze discrimination of three symmetric pure states of a qubit. The measurements are classified into three types, and one of the three types is optimal depending on the value of the error margin. The problem is formulated as one of semidefinite programming. Starting with the dual problem derived from the primal one, we analytically obtain the optimal success probability and the optimal measurement that attains it in each domain of the error margin. Moreover, we analyze the case of three symmetric mixed states of a qubit.

<p>
We investigate how to protect quantum correlations for two qubits each locally interacting with its own non-Markovian environment by making use of bang-bang pulses. It is shown that the quantum discord dynamics presents the phenomenon of sudden change for some certain initial states. We also find that the amount of quantum correlation between two qubits can be improved by applying a train of pulses and protected more effectively with shorter interval pulses or longer reservoir correlation time.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5681  
<blockquote>
<p>
We evaluate the spin squeezing dynamics of N independent spin-1/2 particles with exchange symmetry. Each spin interacts with its own reservoir, and the reservoirs are independently and identical. The spin squeezing parameter is analytically calculated with different kinds of decoherence. The spin squeezing property vanishes with evolution time under the Markovian decoherence. Whereas coupled to the non-Markovian decoherence channels, the spin squeezing property collapses and revives with time. As spin squeezing can be regarded as a witness of multipartite entanglement, thus our scheme shows the collapse and revival of multipartite entanglement under non-Markovian decoherence.

<p>
We studied the dynamics of an initially inverted atom in a semi-infinite waveguide, in the presence of a single propagating photon. We show that atomic relaxation is enhanced by a factor of 2, leading to maximal bunching in the output field. This optimal irreversible stimulated emission is a novel phenomenon that can be observed with state-of-the-art solid-state atoms and waveguides. When the atom interacts with two one-dimensional electromagnetic environments, the preferential emission in the stimulated field can be exploited to efficiently amplify a classical or a quantum state.

We study an initially inverted three-level atom in the lambda configuration embedded in a waveguide, interacting with a propagating single-photon pulse.

This quantum transistor operates over a wide range of frequencies, and can be implemented with today's solid-state technologies.

We review a recently developed theoretical approach to the experimental detection and quantification of bipartite quantum correlations between a qubit and a d dimensional system. Specifically, introducing a properly designed measure Q, the presented scheme allows us to quantify general quantum correlations for arbitrary states of 2 x d systems without the need to fully reconstruct them by tomographic techniques. We take in exam the specifics of the required experimental architecture in nuclear magnetic resonance and optical settings. Finally we extend this approach to models of open system dynamics and discuss possible advantages and limitations in such a context.

<blockquote>
<p>
Codeword stabilized quantum codes provide a unified approach to constructing quantum error-correcting codes, including both additive and non-additive quantum codes. Standard codeword stabilized quantum codes encode quantum information into subspaces. The more general notion of encoding quantum information into a subsystem is known as an operator (or subsystem) quantum error correcting code. Most operator codes studied to date are based in the usual stabilizer formalism. We introduce operator quantum codes based on the codeword stabilized quantum code framework. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for operator quantum error correction, we derive a error correction condition for operator codeword stabilized quantum codes. Based on this condition, the word operators of a operator codeword stabilized quantum code are constructed from a set of classical binary errors induced by generators of the gauge group. We use this scheme to construct examples of both additive and non-additive codes that encode quantum information into a subsystem.

The model shows instances where one has non-Markovianity in both senses and cases when one has Markovianity in the second sense but not in the first one.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6371  
<blockquote>
<p>
While adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) possesses some intrinsic robustness to noise, it is expected that a form of error control will be necessary for large scale computations. Error control ideas developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily to the AQC model and to date there have been two main proposals to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy gap protection and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that these two methods are fundamentally related and may be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for fault-tolerant, large-scale AQC and that a form of error correction is needed. This manuscript has been superseded by the articles, "Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and challenges," arXiv:1307.5893, and "Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics," arXiv:1307.5892.

Zhuo Wang, Sixia Yu, Heng Fan, C.H. Oh  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6529  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction assisted by entanglement helps to transmit the encoded qudits through quantum channels with some of them being noiseless. Here we consider a more realistic scheme for experiments what we called as partial-noisy quantum channels in which, instead of completely free of noise, only part of the qudit suffers no noise. In this scenario we show by an explicit example that two half-noisy channels work better than one noiseless channel, a queer phenomenon showing 1/2+1/2>1. Our example also saturates a unified quantum Singleton bound, valid for the standard and entanglement-assisted codes as well. Furthermore, as illustrated by a mixed-alphabet code with half-noisy channels, a higher dimensional physical qudit can so improve the performance of a partial-noisy channel that it even outperforms a noiseless channel.

Jaroslav Novotny, Gernot Alber, Igor Jex  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0764  
<blockquote>
<p>
The asymptotic dynamics of quantum Markov chains generated by the most general physically relevant quantum operations is investigated. It is shown that it is confined to an attractor space on which the resulting quantum Markov chain is diagonalizable. A construction procedure of a basis of this attractor space and its associated dual basis is presented. It applies whenever a strictly positive quantum state exists which is contracted or left invariant by the generating quantum operation. Moreover, algebraic relations between the attractor space and Kraus operators involved in the definition of a quantum Markov chain are derived. This construction is not only expected to offer significant computational advantages in cases in which the dimension of the Hilbert space is large and the dimension of the attractor space is small but it also sheds new light onto the relation between the asymptotic dynamics of quantum Markov chains and fixed points of their generating quantum operations.

<blockquote>
<p>
Giant optical nonlinearity is observed under both continuous-wave and pulsed excitation in a deterministically-coupled quantum dot-micropillar system, in a pronounced strong-coupling regime. Using absolute reflectivity measurements we determine the critical intracavity photon number as well as the input and output coupling efficiencies of the device. Thanks to a near-unity input-coupling efficiency, we demonstrate a record nonlinearity threshold of only 8 incident photons per pulse. The output-coupling efficiency is found to strongly influence this nonlinearity threshold. We show how the fundamental limit of single-photon nonlinearity can be attained in realistic devices, which would provide an effective interaction between two coincident single photons.

We investigate a new class of optical mesh periodic structures that are discretized in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. These networks are composed of waveguide arrays that are discretely coupled while phase elements are also inserted to discretely control their effective potentials and can be realized both in the temporal and the spatial domain. Their band structure and impulse response is studied in both the passive and parity-time (PT) symmetric regime. The possibility of band merging and the emergence of exceptional points along with the associated optical dynamics are considered in detail both above and below the PT-symmetry breaking point. Finally unidirectional invisibility in PT-synthetic mesh lattices is also examined along with possible superluminal light transport dynamics.

<p>
We study for the first time the effect of the geometry of quantum wire networks on their nonlinear optical properties and show that for some geometries, the first hyperpolarizability is largely enhanced and the second hyperpolarizability is always negative or zero. We use a one-electron model with tight transverse confinement. In the limit of infinite transverse confinement, the transverse wavefunctions drop out of the hyperpolarizabilities, but their residual effects are essential to include in the sum rules. The effects of geometry are manifested in the projections of the transition moments of each wire segment onto the 2-D lab frame. Numerical optimization of the geometry of a loop leads to hyperpolarizabilities that rival the best chromophores. We suggest that a combination of geometry and quantum-confinement effects can lead to systems with ultralarge nonlinear response.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2143  
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete-time quantum walks have been shown to simulate all known topological phases in one and two dimensions. Being periodically driven quantum systems, their topological description, however, is more complex than that of closed Hamiltonian systems. We map out the topological phases of the particle-hole symmetric one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk. We find that there is no chiral symmetry in this system: its topology arises from the particle-hole symmetry alone. We calculate the Z2 \times Z2 topological invariant in a simple way that is consistent with a general definition for 1-dimensional periodically driven quantum systems. These results allow for a transparent interpretation of the edge states on a finite lattice via the the bulk-boundary correspondance. We find that the bulk Floquet operator does not contain all the information needed for the topological invariant. As an illustration to this statement, we show that in the split-step quantum walk, the edges between two bulks with the same Floquet operator can host topologically protected edge states.

<p>
In this paper the inverse problem of the correspondence between the solutions of the Dirac equation and the electromagnetic 4-potentials, is fully solved. The Dirac solutions are classified into two classes. The first one consists of degenerate Dirac solutions corresponding to an infinite number of 4-potentials while the second one consists of non-degenerate Dirac solutions corresponding to one and only one electromagnetic 4-potential. Explicit expressions for the electromagnetic 4-potentials are provided in both cases. Further, in the case of the degenerate Dirac solutions, it is proven that at least two 4-potentials are gauge inequivalent, and consequently correspond to different electromagnetic fields. An example is provided to illustrate this case.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3256  
<blockquote>
<p>
Coherent feedback control considers purely quantum controllers in order to overcome disadvantages such as the acquisition of suitable quantum information, quantum error correction, etc. These approaches lack a systematic characterization of quantum realizability. Recently, a condition characterizing when a system described as a linear stochastic differential equation is quantum was developed. Such condition was named physical realizability, and it was developed for linear quantum systems satisfying the quantum harmonic oscillator canonical commutation relations. In this context, open two-level quantum systems escape the realm of the current known condition. When compared to linear quantum system, the challenges in obtaining such condition for such systems radicate in that the evolution equation is now a bilinear quantum stochastic differential equation and that the commutation relations for such systems are dependent on the system variables. The goal of this paper is to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the preservation of the Pauli commutation relations, as well as to make explicit the relationship between this condition and physical realizability.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3329  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on three-dimensional optical trapping of single ions in an optical lattice formed by two counter-propagating laser beams. We characterize the trapping parameters of the standing wave using the ion as a sensor stored in a hybrid trap consisting of a radio-frequency (rf), a dc, and the optical potential. When loading ions directly from the rf into the standing-wave trap, we observe a dominant heating rate. Monte Carlo simulations confirm rf-induced parametric excitations within the deep optical lattice as the main source. We demonstrate a way around this effect by an alternative transfer protocol which involves an intermediate step of optical confinement in a single-beam trap avoiding the temporal overlap of the standing wave and the rf field. Implications arise for hybrid (rf/optical) and pure optical traps as platforms for ultra-cold chemistry experiments exploring atom--ion collisions or quantum simulation experiments with ions, or combinations of ions and atoms.

Optical frequency comparison of the 40Ca+ clock transition \nu_{Ca} (2S1/2-2D5/2, 729nm) against the 87Sr optical lattice clock transition \nu_{Sr}(1S0-3P0, 698nm) has resulted in a frequency ratio \nu_{Ca} / \nu_{Sr} = 0.957 631 202 358 049 9(2 3). The rapid nature of optical comparison allowed the statistical uncertainty of frequency ratio \nu_{Ca} / \nu_{Sr} to reach 1x10-15 in only 1000s and yielded a value consistent with that calculated from separate absolute frequency measurements of \nu_{Ca} using the International Atomic Time (TAI) link. The total uncertainty of the frequency ratio using optical comparison (free from microwave link uncertainties) is smaller than that obtained using absolute frequency measurement, demonstrating the advantage of optical frequency evaluation. We report the absolute frequency of ^{40}Ca+ with a systematic uncertainty 14 times smaller than our previous measurement [1].

We propose a new experiment on measuring the Casimir force and its gradient between an Au-coated sphere and two different plates made of doped semiconductors. The concentrations of charge carriers in the plates are chosen slightly below and above the critical density at which the Mott-Anderson insulator-metal transition occurs. We calculate changes in the Casimir force and the Casimir pressure due to the insulator-metal transition using the standard Lifshitz theory and the phenomenological approach neglecting the contribution of free charge carriers in the dielectric permittivity of insulator materials (this approach was recently supported by the measurement data of several experiments). It is demonstrated that for the special selection of semiconductor materials (S- or Se-doped Si, B-doped diamond) calculation results using both theoretical approaches differ significantly and the predicted effects are easily detectable using the existing laboratory setups. In the case that the prediction of the phenomenological approach is confirmed, this would open opportunities to modify the van der Waals and Casimir forces with almost no change of room-temperature dielectric permittivity.

In this paper, a complex-valued measure of bi-product path space induced by quantum walk is presented. In particular, we consider three types of conditional return paths in a power set of the bi-product path space (1) $\Lambda \times \Lambda $, (2) $\Lambda \times \Lambda'$ and (3) $\Lambda'\times \Lambda'$, where $\Lambda$ is the set of all $2n$-length ($n\in \mathbb{N}$) return paths and $\Lambda'(\subseteq \Lambda)$ is the set of all $2n$-length return paths going through $nx$ ($x\in [-1,1]$) at time $n$. We obtain asymptotic behaviors of the complex-valued measures for the situations (1)-(3) which imply two kinds of weak convergence theorems (Theorems 1 and 2). One of them suggests a weak limit of weak values.
