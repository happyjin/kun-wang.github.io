<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correcting codes enable the information contained in a quantum state to be protected from decoherence due to external perturbations. Applied to NMR, quantum coding does not alter normal relaxation, but rather converts the state of a ``data'' spin into multiple quantum coherences involving additional ancilla spins. These multiple quantum coherences relax at differing rates, thus permitting the original state of the data to be approximately reconstructed by mixing them together in an appropriate fashion. This paper describes the operation of a simple, three-bit quantum code in the product operator formalism, and uses geometric algebra methods to obtain the error-corrected decay curve in the presence of arbitrary correlations in the external random fields. These predictions are confirmed in both the totally correlated and uncorrelated cases by liquid-state NMR experiments on 13C-labeled alanine, using gradient-diffusion methods to implement these idealized decoherence models. Quantum error correction in weakly polarized systems requires that the ancilla spins be prepared in a pseudo-pure state relative to the data spin, which entails a loss of signal that exceeds any potential gain through error correction. Nevertheless, this study shows that quantum coding can be used to validate theoretical decoherence mechanisms, and to provide detailed information on correlations in the underlying NMR relaxation dynamics.

**3.    An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction**

in Quantum Computation: A Grand Mathematical Challenge for the Twenty-First Century and the Millennium, ed. S. J. Lomonaco, Jr., pp. 221-235 (American Mathematical Society, Providence, Rhode Island, 2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004072  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements.

**4.    Quantum Clock Synchronization Based on Shared Prior Entanglement**  
Richard Jozsa, Daniel S. Abrams, Jonathan P. Dowling, Colin P. Williams  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0004105  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that two spatially separated parties (Alice and Bob) can utilize shared prior quantum entanglement, and classical communications, to establish a synchronized pair of atomic clocks. In contrast to classical synchronization schemes, the accuracy of our protocol is independent of Alice or Bob's knowledge of their relative locations or of the properties of the intervening medium.

**5.    Interplay between Zeeman Coupling and Swap Action in Spin-based Quantum Computer Models: Error Correction in Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields**  
Xuedong Hu, Rogerio de Sousa, S. Das Sarma  
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 918 (2001).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0004459  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider theoretically the interplay between Zeeman coupling and exchange-induced swap action in spin-based quantum dot quantum computer models in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields, which are invariably present in real systems. We estimate quantitatively swap errors caused by the inhomogeneous field, establishing that error correction would, in principle, be possible in the presence of non-uniform magnetic fields in realistic structures.
