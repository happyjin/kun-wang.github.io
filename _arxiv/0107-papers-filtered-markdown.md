**1.    Translation-covariant Markovian master equation for a test particle in a quantum fluid**  
B. Vacchini  
J. Math. Phys. 42 (2001) 4291-4312  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107009  
<blockquote>
<p>
A recently proposed master equation in the Lindblad form is studied with respect to covariance properties and existence of a stationary solution. The master equation describes the interaction of a test particle with a quantum fluid, the so-called Rayleigh gas, and is characterized by the appearance of a two-point correlation function known as dynamic structure factor, which reflects symmetry and statistical mechanics properties of the fluid. In the case of a free gas all relevant physical parameters, such as fugacity, ratio between the masses, momentum transfer and energy transfer are put into evidence, giving an exact expansion of the dynamic structure factor. The limit in which these quantities are small is then considered. In particular in the Brownian limit a Fokker-Planck equation is obtained in which the corrections due to quantum statistics can be explicitly evaluated and are given in terms of the Bose function $g_0 (z)$ and the Fermi function $f_0 (z)$.

**2.    Fidelity and the communication of quantum information**  
Stephen M. Barnett, Claire R. Gilson, Masahide Sasaki  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34(35), 6755 (2001).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107024  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare and contrast the error probability and fidelity as measures of the quality of the receiver's measurement strategy for a quantum communications system. The error probability is a measure of the ability to retrieve {\it classical} information and the fidelity measures the retrieval of {\it quantum} information. We present the optimal measurement strategies for maximising the fidelity given a source that encodes information on the symmetric qubit-states.

**3.    Quantum-scissors device for optical state truncation: A proposal for practical realization**  
Sahin Kaya Ozdemir, Adam Miranowicz, Masato Koashi, Nobuyuki Imoto  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 063818 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107048  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a realizable experimental scheme to prepare superposition of the vacuum and one-photon states by truncating an input coherent state. The scheme is based on the quantum scissors device proposed by Pegg, Phillips, and Barnett [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] and uses photon-counting detectors, a single-photon source, and linear optical elements. Realistic features of the photon counting and single-photon generation are taken into account and possible error sources are discussed together with their effect on the fidelity and efficiency of the truncation process. Wigner function and phase distribution of the generated states are given and discussed for the evaluation of the proposed scheme.

**4.    Probabilistic Quantum Logic Operations Using Polarizing Beam Splitters**  
T.B. Pittman, B.C. Jacobs, J.D. Franson  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 062311 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107091  
<blockquote>
<p>
It has previously been shown that probabilistic quantum logic operations can be performed using linear optical elements, additional photons (ancilla), and post-selection based on the output of single-photon detectors. Here we describe the operation of several quantum logic operations of an elementary nature, including a quantum parity check and a quantum encoder, and we show how they can be combined to implement a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. All of these gates can be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one state of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization, which allows a simple explanation of each operation. We also describe a polarizing beam splitter implementation of a CNOT gate that is closely analogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by Gottesman and Chuang [Nature 402, p.390 (1999)]. Finally, our approach has the interesting feature that it makes practical use of a quantum-eraser technique.

**5.    Discrimination of the Bell states of qudits by means of linear optics**  
Miloslav Dusek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107119  
<blockquote>
<p>
The question of the discrimination of the Bell states of two qudits (i.e., d-dimensional quantum systems) by means of passive linear optical elements and conditional measurements is discussed. A qudit is supposed to be represented by d optical modes containing exactly one photon altogether. From recent results of Calsamiglia it follows that there is no way how to distinguish the Bell states of two qudits for d>2 - not even with the probability of success lower than one - without any auxiliary photons in ancillary modes. Following the results of Carollo and Palma it is proved that it is impossible to distinguish even only one such a Bell state with certainty (i.e., with the probability of success equal to one), irrespective of how many auxiliary photons are involved. However, it is shown that auxiliary photons can help to discriminate the Bell states of qudits with the high probability of success: A Bell-state analyzer based on the idea of linear optics quantum computation that can achieve the probability of success arbitrarily close to one is described. It requires many auxiliary photons that must be first "combined" into entangled states.

**6.    PPLN Waveguide for Quantum Communication**  
S.Tanzilli, H.de Riedmatten, W.Tittel, H. Zbinden, P. Baldi, M. de Micheli, D.B. Ostrowsky, N. Gisin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107125  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on energy-time and time-bin entangled photon-pair sources based on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Degenerate twin photons at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and coupled into standard telecom fibers. Our PPLN waveguide features a very high conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6), roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes, this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed pump. To investigate the quality of the entangled states, we perform photon-pair interference experiments, leading to visibilities of 97% for the case of energy-time entanglement and of 84% for the case of time-bin entanglement. Although the last figure must still be improved, these tests demonstrate the high potential of PPLN waveguide based sources to become a key element for future quantum communication schemes

**7.    Preparation of polarization entangled mixed states of two photons**  
Chuanwei Zhang  
Phys. Rev. A 69, 014304 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107145  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for preparing arbitrary two photons polarization entangled mixed states via controlled location decoherence. The scheme uses only linear optical devices and single-mode optical fibers, and may be feasible in experiment within current optical technology.

**8.    Conditional beam splitting attack on quantum key distribution**  
John Calsamiglia, Stephen M. Barnett, Norbert LÃ¼tkenhaus  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 012312 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107148  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a novel attack on quantum key distribution based on the idea of adaptive absorption [calsam01]. The conditional beam splitting attack is shown to be much more efficient than the conventional beam spitting attack, achieving a performance similar to the, powerful but currently unfeasible, photon number splitting attack. The implementation of the conditional beam splitting attack, based solely on linear optical elements, is well within reach of current technology.
