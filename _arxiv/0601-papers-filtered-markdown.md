**1.    Dependences of the Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a cavity wall on atomic and material properties**  
V.M.Mostepanenko, J.F.Babb, A.O.Caride, G.L.Klimchitskaya, S.I.Zanette  
J. Phys. A, v.39, N21, pp6583--6587 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601031  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Casimir-Polder and van der Waals interactions between an atom and a flat cavity wall are investigated under the influence of real conditions including the dynamic polarizability of the atom, actual conductivity of the wall material and nonzero temperature of the wall. The cases of different atoms near metal and dielectric walls are considered. It is shown that to obtain accurate results for the atom-wall interaction at short separations, one should use the complete tabulated optical data for the complex refractive index of the wall material and the accurate dynamic polarizability of an atom. At relatively large separations in the case of a metal wall, one may use the plasma model dielectric function to describe the dielectric properties of wall material. The obtained results are important for the theoretical interpretation of experiments on quantum reflection and Bose-Einstein condensation.

**2.    Single spin measurement using cellular automata techniques**  
Carlos A. Perez-Delgado, Michele Mosca, Paola Cappellaro, David G. Cory  
Physical Review Letters 97, 100501 (2006).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601054  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an approach for single spin measurement. Our method uses techniques from the theory of quantum cellular automata to correlate a large amount of ancillary spins to the one to be measured. It has the distinct advantage of being efficient, and to a certain extent fault-tolerant. Under ideal conditions, it requires the application of only order of cube root of N steps (each requiring a constant number of rf pulses) to create a system of N correlated spins. It is also fairly robust against pulse errors, imperfect initial polarization of the ancilla spin system, and does not rely on entanglement. We study the scalability of our scheme through numerical simulation.

**3.    Shot noise in an electron waveguide square root of NOT gate**  
Linda E. Reichl, Michael G. Snyder  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601113  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a calculation of the shot noise in a ballistic electron waveguide square root of NOT gate. A general expression for the shot noise in the leads connected to these types of gates is shown. We then parameterize an S-matrix which qualitatively describes the action of a square root of NOT gate previously found through numerical methods for GaAs/Al_xGa_{1-x}As based waveguides systems. Using this S-matrix, the shot noise in a single output lead and across two output leads is calculated. We find that the measurement of the shot noise across two output leads allows for the determination of the fidelity of the gate itself.

**4.    Remarkable Degenerate Quantum Stabilizer Codes Derived from Duadic Codes**  
Salah A. Aly, Andreas Klappenecker, Pradeep Kiran Sarvepalli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601117  
<blockquote>
<p>
Good quantum codes, such as quantum MDS codes, are typically nondegenerate, meaning that errors of small weight require active error-correction, which is--paradoxically--itself prone to errors. Decoherence free subspaces, on the other hand, do not require active error correction, but perform poorly in terms of minimum distance. In this paper, examples of degenerate quantum codes are constructed that have better minimum distance than decoherence free subspaces and allow some errors of small weight that do not require active error correction. In particular, two new families of [[n,1,>= sqrt(n)]]_q degenerate quantum codes are derived from classical duadic codes.

**5.    Quantum regression theorem for non-Markovian Lindblad equations**  
Adrian A. Budini  
J. Stat. Phys. 131, 51 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601140  
<blockquote>
<p>
We find the conditions under which a quantum regression theorem can be assumed valid for non-Markovian master equations consisting in Lindblad superoperators with memory kernels. Our considerations are based on a generalized Born-Markov approximation, which allows us to obtain our results from an underlying Hamiltonian description. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian quantum regression theorem can only be granted in a stationary regime if the dynamics satisfies a quantum detailed balance condition. As an example we study the correlations of a two level system embedded in a complex structured reservoir and driven by an external coherent field.

**6.    Cloning of Gaussian states by linear optics**  
Stefano Olivares, Matteo G. A. Paris, Ulrik L. Andersen  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 062330 (2006).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601164  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze in details a scheme for cloning of Gaussian states based on linear optical components and homodyne detection recently demonstrated by U. L. Andersen et al. [PRL 94 240503 (2005)]. The input-output fidelity is evaluated for a generic (pure or mixed) Gaussian state taking into account the effect of non-unit quantum efficiency and unbalanced mode-mixing. In addition, since in most quantum information protocols the covariance matrix of the set of input states is not perfectly known, we evaluate the average cloning fidelity for classes of Gaussian states with the degree of squeezing and the number of thermal photons being only partially known.

**7.    A microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap for scalable quantum information processing**  
S. Seidelin, J. Chiaverini, R. Reichle, J. J. Bollinger, D. Leibfried, J. Britton, J. H. Wesenberg, R. B. Blakestad, R. J. Epstein, D. B. Hume, J. D. Jost, C. Langer, R. Ozeri, N. Shiga, D. J. Wineland  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 253003 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601173  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate confinement of individual atomic ions in a radio-frequency Paul trap with a novel geometry where the electrodes are located in a single plane and the ions confined above this plane. This device is realized with a relatively simple fabrication procedure and has important implications for quantum state manipulation and quantum information processing using large numbers of ions. We confine laser-cooled Mg-24 ions approximately 40 micrometer above planar gold electrodes. We measure the ions' motional frequencies and compare them to simulations. From measurements of the escape time of ions from the trap, we also determine a heating rate of approximately five motional quanta per millisecond for a trap frequency of 5.3 MHz.

**8.    Linear optical scheme for error-free entanglement distribution and a quantum repeater**  
Demetrios Kalamidas  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 054304 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601203  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a linear optical scheme for error-free distribution of two-photon polarization entangled Bell states over noisy channels. The scheme can be applied to an elementary quantum repeater protocol with potentially significant improvements in efficiency and system complexity. The scheme is based on the use of polarization and time-bin encoding of photons and can perform single-pair, single-step purification with currently available technology.

**9.    Constrained Mechanics and Noiseless Subsystems**  
Tomasz Konopka, Fotini Markopoulou  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0601028  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many theories are formulated as constrained systems. We provide a mechanism that explains the origin of physical states of a constrained system by a process of selection of noiseless subsystems when the system is coupled to an external environment. Effectively, physical states that solve all the constraints are selected by a passive error correction scheme which has been developed in the context of quantum information processing. We apply this mechanism to several constrained theories including the relativistic particle, electromagnetism, and quantum gravity, and discuss some interesting (and speculative) implications on the problem of time and the status of symmetries in nature.

**10.    Properties of quasi-one-dimensional molecules with Feshbach resonance interaction**  
V. A. Yurovsky  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 052709 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0601073  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bound states and collisions of atoms with two-channel two-body interactions in harmonic waveguides are analyzed. The closed-channel contributions to two-atom bound states become dominant in the case of a weak resonance. At low energies and values of the non-resonant scattering length the problem can be approximated by a one-dimensional resonant model. Three-body problem becomes nonintegrable and the properties of triatomic molecules become different from those predicted by the integrable Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model.
