**1.    The Quantum Fourier Transform and Extensions of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem**  
Lisa R. Hales  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212002  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) has emerged as the primary tool in quantum algorithms which achieve exponential advantage over classical computation and lies at the heart of the solution to the abelian hidden subgroup problem, of which Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log algorithms are a special case. We begin by addressing various computational issues surrounding the QFT and give improved parallel circuits for both the QFT over a power of 2 and the QFT over an arbitrary cyclic group. These circuits are based on new insight into the relationship between the discrete Fourier transform over different cyclic groups. We then exploit this insight to extend the class of hidden subgroup problems with efficient quantum solutions. First we relax the condition that the underlying hidden subgroup function be distinct on distinct cosets of the subgroup in question and show that this relaxation can be solved whenever G is a finitely-generated abelian group. We then extend this reasoning to the hidden cyclic subgroup problem over the reals, showing how to efficiently generate the bits of the period of any sufficiently piecewise-continuous function on R. Finally, we show that this problem of period-finding over R, viewed as an oracle promise problem, is strictly harder than its integral counterpart. In particular, period-finding over R lies outside the complexity class MA, a class which contains period-finding over the integers.

**2.    The rotating wave system-reservoir coupling: limitations and meaning in the non-Markovian regime**  
F. Intravaia, S. Maniscalco, A. Messina  
Eur. Phys. J. B 32, 97 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212009  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper deals with the dissipative dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a bosonic reservoir. The Master Equations based on the Rotating Wave and on the Feynman-Vernon system--reservoir couplings are compared highlighting differences and analogies. We discuss quantitatively and qualitatively the conditions under which the counter rotating terms can be neglected. By comparing the analytic solution of the heating function relative to the two different coupling models we conclude that, even in the weak coupling limit, the counter rotating terms give rise to a significant contribution in the non--Markovian short time regime. The main result of this paper is that such a contribution is actually experimentally measurable and thus relevant for a correct description of the system dynamics.

**3.    Practical scheme for the optimal measuremnet in quantum interferometric devices**  
Masahiro Takeoka, Masashi Ban, Masahide Sasaki  
Phys. Lett. A 313 (2003) pp. 16-20  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply a Kennedy-type detection scheme, which was originally proposed for a binary communications system, to interferometric sensing devices. We show that the minimum detectable perturbation of the proposed system reaches the ultimate precision bound which is predicted by Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing. To provide concrete examples, we apply our interferometric scheme to phase shift detection by using coherent and squeezed probe fields.

**4.    Systematic Analysis of Majorization in Quantum Algorithms**  
Roman Orus, Jose I. Latorre, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado  
European Physical Journal D 29, 119-132 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212094  
<blockquote>
<p>
Motivated by the need to uncover some underlying mathematical structure of optimal quantum computation, we carry out a systematic analysis of a wide variety of quantum algorithms from the majorization theory point of view. We conclude that step-by-step majorization is found in the known instances of fast and efficient algorithms, namely in the quantum Fourier transform, in Grover's algorithm, in the hidden affine function problem, in searching by quantum adiabatic evolution and in deterministic quantum walks in continuous time solving a classically hard problem. On the other hand, the optimal quantum algorithm for parity determination, which does not provide any computational speed-up, does not show step-by-step majorization. Lack of both speed-up and step-by-step majorization is also a feature of the adiabatic quantum algorithm solving the 2-SAT ``ring of agrees'' problem. Furthermore, the quantum algorithm for the hidden affine function problem does not make use of any entanglement while it does obey majorization. All the above results give support to a step-by-step Majorization Principle necessary for optimal quantum computation.

**5.    Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Quantum Information Processing using a two-dimensional Fourier Transform Technique**  
Ranabir Das, T.S. Mahesh, Anil Kumar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212116  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new method of quantum state tomography for quantum information processing is described. The method based on two-dimensional Fourier transform technique involves detection of all the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix in a two-dimensional experiment. All the diagonal elements are detected in another one-dimensional experiment. The method is efficient and applicable to a wide range of spin systems. The proposed method is explained using a 2 qubit system and demonstrated by tomographing arbitrary complex density matrices of 2 and 4 qubit systems using simulations.

**6.    Implement Quantum Random Walks with Linear Optics Elements**  
Zhi Zhao, Jiangfeng Du, Hui Li, Tao Yang, Zeng-Bing Chen, Jian-Wei Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212149  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum random walk has drawn special interests because its remarkable features to the classical counterpart could lead to new quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a feasible scheme to implement quantum random walks on a line using only linear optics elements. With current single-photon interference technology, the steps that could be experimentally implemented can be extended to very large numbers. We also show that, by decohering the quantum states, our scheme for quantum random walk tends to be classical.

**7.    Non-ideality of quantum operations with the electron spin of a 31P donor in a Si crystal due to interaction with a nuclear spin system**  
S. Saikin, L. Fedichkin  
Phys. Rev. B 67, 161302(R) (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0212501  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine a 31P donor electron spin in a Si crystal to be used for the purposes of quantum computation. The interaction with an uncontrolled system of 29Si nuclear spins influences the electron spin dynamics appreciably. The hyperfine field at the 29Si nuclei positions is non-collinear with the external magnetic field. Quantum operations with the electron wave function, i.e. using magnetic field pulses or electrical gates, change the orientation of hyperfine field and disturb the nuclear spin system. This disturbance produces a deviation of the electron spin qubit from an ideal state, at a short time scale in comparison with the nuclear spin diffusion time. For H_ext=9 T, the estimated error rate is comparable to the threshold value required by the quantum error correction algorithms. The rate is lower at higher external magnetic fields.

**8.    Crossover from Diffusive to Ballistic Transport in Periodic Quantum Maps**  
Daniel K. Wojcik, J. Robert Dorfman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0212036  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive an expression for the mean square displacement of a particle whose motion is governed by a uniform, periodic, quantum multi-baker map. The expression is a function of both time, $t$, and Planck's constant, $\hbar$, and allows a study of both the long time, $t\to\infty$, and semi-classical, $\hbar\to 0$, limits taken in either order. We evaluate the expression using random matrix theory as well as numerically, and observe good agreement between both sets of results. The long time limit shows that particle transport is generically ballistic, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. The mean square displacement for non-zero Planck's constant, and finite time, exhibits a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant. We argue, that these results are generic for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum multi-baker, and that a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Some connections between our work and the other literature on quantum random walks are discussed. These walks are of some interest in the theory of quantum computation.
