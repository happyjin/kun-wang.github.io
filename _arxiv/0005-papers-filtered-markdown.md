**1.    Preparation of GHZ states via Grover's quantum searching algorithm**  
Hao-Sheng Zeng, Le-Man Kuang  
Chin. Phys. Lett. 17 (2000) 410  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005002  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we propose an approach to prepare GHZ states of an arbitrary multi-particle system in terms of Grover's fast quantum searching algorithm. This approach can be regarded as an extension of the Grover's algorithm to find one or more items in an unsorted database.

**2.    Quantum Kolmogorov Complexity**  
Andre Berthiaume, Wim van Dam, Sophie Laplante  
Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2001, pages 201-221  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005018  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we give a definition for quantum Kolmogorov complexity. In the classical setting, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of the shortest program that can produce this string as its output. It is a measure of the amount of innate randomness (or information) contained in the string. We define the quantum Kolmogorov complexity of a qubit string as the length of the shortest quantum input to a universal quantum Turing machine that produces the initial qubit string with high fidelity. The definition of Vitanyi (Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Annual Conference on Computational Complexity, 2000) measures the amount of classical information, whereas we consider the amount of quantum information in a qubit string. We argue that our definition is natural and is an accurate representation of the amount of quantum information contained in a quantum state.

**3.    Heating of trapped particles close to surfaces - Blackbody and beyond**  
C. Henkel, M. Wilkens  
acta phys. slov. 50 (2000) 293-304  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005038  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss heating and decoherence in traps for ions and neutral particles close to metallic surfaces. We focus on simple trap geometries and compute noise spectra of thermally excited electromagnetic fields. If the trap is located in the near field of the substrate, the field fluctuations are largely increased compared to the level of the blackbody field, leading to much shorter coherence and life times of the trapped atoms. The corresponding time constants are computed for ion traps and magnetic traps. Analytical estimates for the size dependence of the noise spectrum are given. We finally discuss prospects for the coherent transport of matter waves in integrated surface waveguides.

**4.    Quantum Amplitude Amplification and Estimation**  
Gilles Brassard, Peter Hoyer, Michele Mosca, Alain Tapp  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005055  
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a Boolean function $\chi: X \to \{0,1\}$ that partitions set $X$ between its good and bad elements, where $x$ is good if $\chi(x)=1$ and bad otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.

**5.    Improved Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force Using Gold Surfaces**  
B.W. Harris, F. Chen, U. Mohideen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005088  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report an improved precision measurement of the Casimir force using metallic gold surfaces. The force is measured between a large gold coated sphere and flat plate using an Atomic Force Microscope. The use of gold surfaces removes some theoretical uncertainties in the interpretation of the measurement. The forces are also measured at smaller surface separations. The complete dielectric spectrum of the metal is used in the comparison of theory to the experiment. The average statistical precision remains at the same 1% of the forces measured at the closest separation. These results should lead to the development of stronger constraints on hypothetical forces.

**6.    Inversionless amplification and laser-induced transparency at the discrete transitions and the transitions to continuum**  
A. K. Popov  
Bull. Russ. A.S., Phys. 60(6)(1996) 927 [Izv. RAN, Fiz. 60(6)(1996) 99]  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005108  
<blockquote>
<p>
The effects of coherence of quantum transitions and the interference of resonant nonlinear optical processes on the spectra of absorption, amplification, and nonlinear-optical generation are considered. The most favorable conditions are discussed for the inversionless amplification, resonant refraction in the absence of absorption and for resonant enhancement of nonlinear-optical generation at the discrete transitions and the transitions to continuum.

A. K. Popov, S. G. Rautian  
Proc. SPIE Vol. 2798 (1996) 49-61  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005114  
<blockquote>
<p>
Interference effects in quantum transitions, giving rise to amplification without inversion, optical transparency and to enhancements in nonlinear optical frequency conversions are considered. Review of the relevant early theoretical and experimental results is given. The role of relaxation processes, spontaneous cascade of polarizations, local field effects, Doppler-broadening, as well as specific features of the interference in the spectral continuum are discussed.

**8.    On the Additivity of Entanglement of Formation**

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005126  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study whether the entanglement of formation is additive over tensor products and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of vector states that enables us to show additivity in two special cases.

**9.    Instabilities and self-socillations in atomic four-wave mixing**  
J. Heurich, H. Pu, M. G. Moore, P. Meystre  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0005479  
<blockquote>
<p>
The development of integrated, waveguide-based atom optical devices requires a thorough understanding of nonlinear matter-wave mixing processes in confined geometries. This paper analyzes the stability of counterpropagating two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in such a geometry. The steady state field equations of this system are solved analytically, predicting a multivalued relation between the input and output field intensities. The spatio-temporal linear stability of these solutions is investigated numerically, leading to the prediction of a self-oscillation threshold that can be expressed in terms of a matter-wave analog of the Fresnel number in optics.

**10.    Power, energy, and spectrum of a naked singularity explosion**  
Tomohiro Harada, Hideo Iguchi, Ken-ichi Nakao  
Phys.Rev. D62 (2000) 084037  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0005114  
<blockquote>
<p>
Naked singularity occurs in the gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous dust ball from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. We show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the naked singularity. The energy flux is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-3/2}$ for a minimally coupled massless scalar field, while is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-1}$ for a conformally coupled massless scalar field, where $t_{\rm CH}-t$ is the `remained time' until the distant observer could observe the singularity if the naked singularity was formed. As a consequence, the radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields. The amount of the power and the energy depends on parameters which characterize the initial density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud. In particular, there is characteristic frequency $\nu_{s}$ of singularity above which the divergent energy is radiated. The energy flux is dominated by particles of which the wave length is about $t_{\rm CH}-t$ at each moment. The observed total spectrum is nonthermal, i.e., $\nu dN/d\nu \sim (\nu/\nu_{s})^{-1}$ for $\nu>\nu_{s}$. If the naked singularity formation could continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is radiated, the radiated energy would reach about $10^{54}(M/M_{\odot})$ erg. The calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out to be consistent as a rough order estimate. The analysis does not depend on whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning. This phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultra high energy cosmic rays or a central engine of gamma ray bursts.

**11.    Waveguides coupled through a semitransparent barrier: a Birman-Schwinger analysis**  
Pavel Exner, David Krejcirik  
Rev.Math.Phys. 13 (2001) 307-334  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0005030  
<blockquote>
<p>
The paper is devoted to a model of a mesoscopic system consisting of a pair of parallel planar waveguides separated by an infinitely thin semitransparent boundary modeled by a transverse delta interaction. We develop the Birman-Schwinger theory for the corresponding generalized Schroedinger operator. The spectral properties become nontrivial if the barrier coupling is not invariant with respect to longitudinal translations, in particular, there are bound states if the barrier is locally more transparent in the mean and the coupling parameter reaches the same asymptotic value in both directions along the guide axis. We derive the weak-coupling expansion of the ground-state eigenvalue for the cases when the perturbation is small in the supremum and the L^1-norms. The last named result applies to the situation when the support of the leaky part shrinks: the obtained asymptotics differs from that of a double guide divided by a pierced Dirichlet barrier. We also derive an upper bound on the number of bound states.
