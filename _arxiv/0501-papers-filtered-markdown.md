**1.    Unconditional quantum cloning of coherent states with linear optics**  
Ulrik L. Andersen, Vincent Josse, Gerd Leuchs  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501005  
<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme for optimal Gaussian cloning of optical coherent states is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Its optical realization is based entirely on simple linear optical elements and homodyne detection. The optimality of the presented scheme is only limited by detection inefficiencies. Experimentally we achieved a cloning fidelity of about 65%, which almost touches the optimal value of 2/3.

**2.    Tensor polarizability and dispersive quantum measurement of multilevel atoms**  
JM Geremia, John K. Stockton, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501033  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optimally extracting information from measurements performed on a physical system requires an accurate model of the measurement interaction. Continuously probing the collective spin of an Alkali atom cloud via its interaction with an off-resonant optical probe is an important example of such a measurement where realistic modeling at the quantum level is possible using standard techniques from atomic physics. Typically, however, tutorial descriptions of this technique have neglected the multilevel structure of realistic atoms for the sake of simplification. In this paper we account for the full multilevel structure of Alkali atoms and derive the irreducible form of the polarizability Hamiltonian describing a typical dispersive quantum measurement. For a specific set of parameters, we then show that semiclassical predictions of the theory are consistent with our experimental observations of polarization scattering by a polarized cloud of laser-cooled Cesium atoms. We also derive the signal-to-noise ratio under a single measurement trial and use this to predict the rate of spin-squeezing with multilevel Alkali atoms for arbitrary detuning of the probe beam.

**3.    Experimental Construction of Optical Multi-qubit Cluster States From Bell States**  
An-Ning Zhang, Chao-Yang Lu, Xiao-Qi Zhou, Yu-Ao Chen, Zhi Zhao, Tao Yang, Jian-Wei Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501036  
<blockquote>
<p>
Cluster states serve as the central physical resource for the measurement-based quantum computation. We here present a simple experimental demonstration of the scalable cluster-state-construction scheme proposed by Browne and Rudolph. In our experiment, three-photon cluster states are created from two Bell states using linear optical devices. By observing a violation of three-particle Mermin inequality of $|< \textit{A}>| = 3.10\pm0.03 $, we also for the first time report a genuine three-photon entanglement. In addition, the entanglement properties of the cluster states are examined under $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_x$ measurements on a qubit.

**4.    Continuous quantum error correction by cooling**  
Mohan Sarovar, G. J. Milburn  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501038  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe an implementation of quantum error correction that operates continuously in time and requires no active interventions such as measurements or gates. The mechanism for carrying away the entropy introduced by errors is a cooling procedure. We evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme by simulation, and remark on its connections to some recently proposed error prevention procedures.

**5.    Optimal measurements for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem**  
Dave Bacon, Andrew M. Childs, Wim van Dam  
Chicago Journal of Theoretical Computer Science (2006), no. 2  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501044  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dihedral hidden subgroup problem as the problem of distinguishing hidden subgroup states. We show that the optimal measurement for solving this problem is the so-called pretty good measurement. We then prove that the success probability of this measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as a function of the density nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the hidden subgroup state and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular, for nu<1 the optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the hidden subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while for nu>1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a probability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of a group G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to solve the hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal measurement for determining a single bit of the answer, and show that it exhibits the same threshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal measurement by a quantum circuit, and thereby establish further connections between the dihedral hidden subgroup problem and average case subset sum problems. In particular, we show that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the optimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset sum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum solutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement.

**6.    Continuous quantum error correction**  
Mohan Sarovar, G. J. Milburn  
Quantum Communication, Measurement & Computing (QCMC'04), ed. S. M. Barnett, E. Andersson, J. Jeffers, P. Ohberg, O. Hirota (AIP Conference Proceedings), p. 121 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501049  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe new implementations of quantum error correction that are continuous in time, and thus described by continuous dynamical maps. We evaluate the performance of such schemes using numerical simulations, and comment on the effectiveness and applicability of continuous error correction for quantum computing.

**7.    The Symmetric Group Defies Strong Fourier Sampling: Part I**  
Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell, Leonard J. Schulman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501056  
<blockquote>
<p>
We resolve the question of whether Fourier sampling can efficiently solve the hidden subgroup problem. Specifically, we show that the hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric group cannot be efficiently solved by strong Fourier sampling, even if one may perform an arbitrary POVM on the coset state. Our results apply to the special case relevant to the Graph Isomorphism problem.

**8.    The Symmetric Group Defies Strong Fourier Sampling: Part II**  
Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501066  
<blockquote>
<p>
Part I of this paper showed that the hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric group--including the special case relevant to Graph Isomorphism--cannot be efficiently solved by strong Fourier sampling, even if one may perform an arbitrary POVM on the coset state. In this paper, we extend these results to entangled measurements. Specifically, we show that the hidden subgroup problem on the symmetric group cannot be solved by any POVM applied to pairs of coset states. In particular, these hidden subgroups cannot be determined by any polynomial number of one- or two-register experiments on coset states.

**9.    High-fidelity teleportation beyond the no-cloning limit and entanglement swapping for continuous variables**  
Nobuyuki Takei, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Takao Aoki, Akira Furusawa  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220502 (2005).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501086  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate continuous-variable quantum teleportation beyond the no-cloning limit. We teleport a coherent state and achieve the fidelity of 0.70$\pm$0.02 that surpasses the no-cloning limit of 2/3. Surpassing the limit is necessary to transfer the nonclassicality of an input quantum state. By using our high-fidelity teleporter, we demonstrate entanglement swapping, namely teleportation of quantum entanglement, as an example of transfer of nonclassicality.

**10.    Unconditional fidelity thresholds in single copy distillation and some aspects of quantum error correction**  
Pawel Horodecki, Maciej Demianowicz  
Phys. Lett. A 354, 40-47 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501105  
<blockquote>
<p>
Various aspects of distillation of noisy entanglement and some associated effects in quantum error correction are considered. In particular we prove that if only one--way classical communication (from Alice to Bob) is allowed and the shared $d \otimes d$ state is not pure then there is a threshold for optimal entanglement fraction $F$ of the state (being an overlap between the shared state and symmetric maximally entangled state) which can be obtained in single copy distillation process. This implies that to get (probabilistically) arbitrary good conclusive teleportation via mixed state at least one classical bit of backward communication (for Bob to Alice) has to be sent. We provide several other threshold properties in this context including in particular the existence of ultimate threshold of optimal $F$ for states of full rank. Finally the threshold results are linked to those of error correction. Namely it is pointed out that in quantum computer working on fixed number of quantum bits almost any kind of noise can be (probabilistically) corrected only to some threshold error bar though there are some (rare) exceptions.

**11.    Linear-algebraic lambda-calculus**  
Pablo Arrighi, Gilles Dowek  
Quantum Programming Languages 2004, satellite of LICS, Turku Centre for Computer Science General Publication, Vol. 33, (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501150  
<blockquote>
<p>
With a view towards models of quantum computation and/or the interpretation of linear logic, we define a functional language where all functions are linear operators by construction. A small step operational semantic (and hence an interpreter/simulator) is provided for this language in the form of a term rewrite system. The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus hereby constructed is linear in a different (yet related) sense to that, say, of the linear lambda-calculus. These various notions of linearity are discussed in the context of quantum programming languages. KEYWORDS: quantum lambda-calculus, linear lambda-calculus, $\lambda$-calculus, quantum logics.

**12.    Structuring quantum effects: superoperators as arrows**  
J. K. Vizzotto, T. Altenkirch, A. Sabry  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501151  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the model of quantum computation based on density matrices and superoperators can be decomposed in a pure classical (functional) part and an effectful part modeling probabilities and measurement. The effectful part can be modeled using a generalization of monads called arrows. We express the resulting executable model of quantum computing in the programming language Haskell using its special syntax for arrow computations. The embedding in Haskell is however not perfect: a faithful model of quantum computing requires type capabilities which are not directly expressible in Haskell.

**13.    Quantum Weakest Preconditions**  
Ellie D'Hondt, Prakash Panangaden  
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, 2006  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a notion of predicate transformer and, in particular, the weakest precondition, appropriate for quantum computation. We show that there is a Stone-type duality between the usual state-transformer semantics and the weakest precondition semantics. Rather than trying to reduce quantum computation to probabilistic programming we develop a notion that is directly taken from concepts used in quantum computation. The proof that weakest preconditions exist for completely positive maps follows immediately from the Kraus representation theorem. As an example we give the semantics of Selinger's language in terms of our weakest preconditions. We also cover some specific situations and exhibit an interesting link with stabilizers.

**14.    Implausible Consequences of Superstrong Nonlocality**  
Wim van Dam  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501159  
<blockquote>
<p>
This Letter looks at the consequences of so-called 'superstrong nonlocal correlations', which are hypothetical violations of Bell/CHSH inequalities that are stronger than quantum mechanics allows, yet weak enough to prohibit faster-than-light communication. It is shown that the existence of maximally superstrong correlated bits implies that all distributed computations can be performed with a trivial amount of communication, i.e. with one bit. If one believes that Nature does not allow such a computational 'free lunch', then the result in the Letter gives a reason why superstrong correlation are indeed not possible.

**15.    Decoherence in Quantum Walks on the Hypercube**  
Gorjan Alagic, Alexander Russell  
Physical Review A 72, 062304 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501169  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a natural notion of decoherence on quantum random walks over the hypercube. We prove that in this model there is a decoherence threshold beneath which the essential properties of the hypercubic quantum walk, such as linear mixing times, are preserved. Beyond the threshold, we prove that the walks behave like their classical counterparts.

**16.    Dephasing by a nonstationary classical intermittent noise**  
Josef Schriefl, Maxime Clusel, David Carpentier, Pascal Degiovanni  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0501301  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a new phenomenological model for a $1/f^{\mu}$ classical intermittent noise and study its effects on the dephasing of a two-level system. Within this model, the evolution of the relative phase between the $|\pm>$ states is described as a continuous time random walk (CTRW). Using renewal theory, we find exact expressions for the dephasing factor and identify the physically relevant various regimes in terms of the coupling to the noise. In particular, we point out the consequences of the non-stationarity and pronounced non-Gaussian features of this noise, including some new anomalous and aging dephasing scenarii.

**17.    Exact location of the multicritical point for finite-dimensional spin glasses: A conjecture**  
Koujin Takeda, Tomohiro Sasamoto, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
J.Phys. A38 (2005) 3751-3774  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0501372  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point in the phase diagram of spin glass models in finite dimensions. By generalizing our previous work, we combine duality and gauge symmetry for replicated random systems to derive formulas which make it possible to understand all the relevant available numerical results in a unified way. The method applies to non-self-dual lattices as well as to self dual cases, in the former case of which we derive a relation for a pair of values of multicritical points for mutually dual lattices. The examples include the +-J and Gaussian Ising spin glasses on the square, hexagonal and triangular lattices, the Potts and Z_q models with chiral randomness on these lattices, and the three-dimensional +-J Ising spin glass and the random plaquette gauge model.
