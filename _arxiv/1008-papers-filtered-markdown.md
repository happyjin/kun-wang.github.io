**1.    Survival probability in a one-dimensional quantum walk on a trapped lattice**  
Meltem Gonulol, Ekrem Aydiner, Yutaka Shikano, Ozgur E. Mustecaplioglu  
New J. Phys. 13, 033037 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0085  
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of the survival probability of quantum walkers on a one-dimensional lattice with random distribution of absorbing immobile traps are investigated. The survival probability of quantum walkers is compared with that of classical walkers. It is shown that the time dependence of survival probability of quantum walkers has a piecewise stretched exponential character depending on the density of traps in numerical and analytical observations. The crossover between the quantum analogs of the Rosenstock and Donsker-Varadhan behaviors is identified.

**2.    Entanglement Witnesses and Characterizing Entanglement Properties of Some PPT States**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, N. Behzadi, Y. Akbari  
The European Physical Journal D, Volume 55, Number 1, 197-203 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0475  
<blockquote>
<p>
On the basis of linear programming, new sets of entanglement witnesses (EWs) for 3x3 and 4x4 systems are constructed. In both cases, the constructed EWs correspond to the hyperplanes contacting, without intersecting, the related feasible regions at line segments and restricted planes respectively. Due to the special property of the contacting area between the hyper-planes and the feasible regions, the corresponding hyper-planes can be turned around the contacting area throughout a bounded interval and hence create an infinite number of EWs. As these EWs are able to detect entanglement of some PPT states, they are non-decomposable (nd-EWs).

**3.    AMENDART in Markovian circuit QED**  
A. V. Dodonov  
Journal of Physics: Conference Series 274, 012137 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0564  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the cavity field's and atomic asymptotic mean excitation numbers due to anti-rotating term (AMENDART) in the circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (circuit QED) system, composed of a two-level atom and a single cavity field mode, subject to Markovian damping and dephasing mechanisms. We show that the AMENDART are above the thermal values, and their behavior is analyzed analytically and numerically for typical parameters in circuit QED implementations described by the Rabi Hamiltonian. We point out that "parasitic elements", such as other cavity modes or eventual off-resonant atoms, also contribute substantially to AMENDART.

**4.    Photon level crosstalk between parallel fibers installed in urban area**  
Mikio Fujiwara, Shigehito Miki, Taro Yamashita, Zhen Wang, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0893  
<blockquote>
<p>
We estimate the channel characteristics of field-installed dark fibers at single photon levels for quantum key distribution (QKD). Measured fibers are telecom single-mode dark fibers over 45 km connecting a center and suburbs of Tokyo. Their total losses are about 14dB, and 50% of the whole lengths are aerial lines. We find that stray light from other public internet fibers is dominant and crosstalk occurs at bending points in laying cables. These results mean the crosstalk from public networks can increase the bit error rate in the QKD system, and imply an underlying information leakage through an adjacent covered-fiber.

**5.    Nuclear Feedback in a Single Electron-Charged Quantum Dot under Pulsed Optical Control**  
Thaddeus D. Ladd, David Press, Kristiaan De Greve, Peter L. McMahon, Benedikt Friess, Christian Schneider, Martin Kamp, Sven Hoefling, Alfred Forchel, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
Proc. SPIE 7948, Advances in Photonics of Quantum Computing, Memory, and Communication IV, 79480U (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0912  
<blockquote>
<p>
Electron spins in quantum dots under coherent control exhibit a number of novel feedback processes. Here, we present experimental and theoretical evidence of a feedback process between nuclear spins and a single electron spin in a single charged InAs quantum dot, controlled by the coherently modified probability of exciting a trion state. We present a mathematical model describing competition between optical nuclear pumping and nuclear spin-diffusion inside the quantum dot. The model correctly postdicts the observation of a hysteretic sawtooth pattern in the free-induction-decay of the single electron spin, hysteresis while scanning a narrowband laser through the quantum dot's optical resonance frequency, and non-sinusoidal fringes in the spin echo. Both the coherent electron-spin rotations, implemented with off-resonant ultrafast laser pulses, and the resonant narrow-band optical pumping for spin initialization interspersed between ultrafast pulses, play a role in the observed behavior. This effect allows dynamic tuning of the electron Larmor frequency to a value determined by the pulse timing, potentially allowing more complex coherent control operations.

**6.    Limit theorems for a localization model of 2-state quantum walks**  
Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1116  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider 2-state quantum walks (QWs) on the line, which are defined by two matrices. One of the matrices operates the walk at only half-time. In the usual QWs, localization does not occur at all. However, our walk can be localized around the origin. In this paper, we present two limit theorems, that is, one is a stationary distribution and the other is a convergence theorem in distribution.

**7.    Optimal path for a quantum teleportation protocol in entangled networks**  
C. Di Franco, D. Ballester  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 010303(R) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1679  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bellman's optimality principle has been of enormous importance in the development of whole branches of applied mathematics, computer science, optimal control theory, economics, decision making, and classical physics. Examples are numerous: dynamic programming, Markov chains, stochastic dynamics, calculus of variations, and the brachistochrone problem. Here we show that Bellman's optimality principle is violated in a teleportation problem on a quantum network. This implies that finding the optimal fidelity route for teleporting a quantum state between two distant nodes on a quantum network with bi-partite entanglement will be a tough problem and will require further investigation.

**8.    Automated Error Correction For Generalized Bell States**  
Pratyush Pandey, Sriram Prasath E., Manu Gupta, Prasanta K. Panigrahi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2129  
<blockquote>
<p>
A procedure is developed to automatically correct the bit flip and the arbitrary phase change errors in Generalized Bell states (GBS). The phase and parity characteristics of the GBS are encoded in ancilla bits without altering the state under consideration. The same information is then used to correct the state at a different point, through appropriate unitrary control operations. It is also shown that the distributed/indirect measurements on ancilla can yield the error syndrome. The restricted error correction circuit obtained for N-qubit entangled states of the Bell type, are generalized for the corresponding higher dimensions, thus opening up the possibility of designing of task specific error correction circuits.

**9.    Interaction-Free All-Optical Switching via Quantum-Zeno Effect**  
Yu-Ping Huang, Joseph B. Altepeter, Prem Kumar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2408  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel interaction-free scheme for all-optical switching which does not rely on the physical coupling between signal and control waves. The interaction-free nature of the scheme allows it to overcome the fundamental photon-loss limit imposed by the signal-pump coupling. The same phenomenon protects photonic-signal states from decoherence, making devices based on this scheme suitable for quantum applications. Focusing on $\chi^{(2)}$ waveguides, we provide device designs for traveling-wave and Fabry-Perot switches. In both designs, the performance is optimal when the signal switching is induced by coherent dynamical evolution. In contrast, when the switching is induced by a rapid dissipation channel, it is less efficient.

**10.    SU(2) and SU(1,1) Approaches to Phase Operators and Temporally Stable Phase States: Applications to Mutually Unbiased Bases and Discrete Fourier Transforms**  
Natig M. Atakishiyev, Maurice Robert Kibler, Kurt Bernardo Wolf  
Symmetry 2 (2010) 1461  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2881  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a group-theoretical approach to the generalized oscillator algebra Ak recently investigated in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 (2010) 115303. The case k > or 0 corresponds to the noncompact group SU(1,1) (as for the harmonic oscillator and the Poeschl-Teller systems) while the case k < 0 is described by the compact group SU(2) (as for the Morse system). We construct the phase operators and the corresponding temporally stable phase eigenstates for Ak in this group-theoretical context. The SU(2) case is exploited for deriving families of mutually unbiased bases used in quantum information. Along this vein, we examine some characteristics of a quadratic discrete Fourier transform in connection with generalized quadratic Gauss sums and generalized Hadamard matrices.

**11.    The ground state of binary systems with a periodic modulation of the linear coupling**  
Armand Niederberger, Boris A. Malomed, Maciej Lewenstein  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2916  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a quasi-one-dimensional two-component systm, described by a pair of Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger/Gross-Pitaevskii Equations (NLSEs/GPEs), which are coupled by the linear mixing, with local strength $\Omega $, and by the nonlinear incoherent interaction. We assume the self-repulsive nonlinearity in both components, and include effects of a harmonic trapping potential. The model may be realized in terms of periodically modulated slab waveguides in nonlinear optics, and in Bose-Einstein condensates too. Depending on the strengths of the linear and nonlinear couplings between the components, the ground states (GSs) in such binary systems may be symmetric or asymmetric. In this work, we introduce a periodic spatial modulation of the linear coupling, making $\Omega $ an odd, or even function of the coordinate. The sign flips of $\Omega (x)$ strongly modify the structure of the GS in the binary system, as the relative sign of its components tends to lock to the local sign of $\Omega $. Using a systematic numerical analysis, and an analytical approximation, we demonstrate that the GS of the trapped system contains one or several kinks (dark solitons) in one component, while the other component does not change its sign. Final results are presented in the form of maps showing the number of kinks in the GS as a function of the system's parameters, with the odd/even modulation function giving rise to the odd/even number of the kinks. The modulation of $\Omega (x)$ also produces a strong effect on the transition between states with nearly equal and strongly unequal amplitudes of the two components.

**12.    Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion for absorption spectra of molecular aggregates**  
Jan Roden, Walter T. Strunz, Alexander Eisfeld  
J. Chem. Phys. 134, 034902 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3567  
<blockquote>
<p>
In many molecular systems one encounters the situation where electronic excitations couple to a quasi-continuum of phonon modes. That continuum may be highly structured e.g. due to some weakly damped high frequency modes. To handle such a situation, an approach combining the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) description of open quantum systems with an efficient but abstract approximation was recently applied to calculate energy transfer and absorption spectra of molecular aggregates [Roden, Eisfeld, Wolff, Strunz, PRL 103 (2009) 058301]. To explore the validity of the used approximation for such complicated systems, in the present work we compare the calculated (approximative) absorption spectra with exact results. These are obtained from the method of pseudomodes, which we show to be capable of determining the exact spectra for small aggregates and a few pseudomodes. It turns out that in the cases considered, the results of the two approaches mostly agree quite well. The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are discussed.

**13.    Universal quantum computation by discontinuous quantum walk**  
Michael S. Underwood, David L. Feder  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042304 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3578  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are the quantum-mechanical analog of random walks, in which a quantum `walker' evolves between initial and final states by traversing the edges of a graph, either in discrete steps from node to node or via continuous evolution under the Hamiltonian furnished by the adjacency matrix of the graph. We present a hybrid scheme for universal quantum computation in which a quantum walker takes discrete steps of continuous evolution. This `discontinuous' quantum walk employs perfect quantum state transfer between two nodes of specific subgraphs chosen to implement a universal gate set, thereby ensuring unitary evolution without requiring the introduction of an ancillary coin space. The run time is linear in the number of simulated qubits and gates. The scheme allows multiple runs of the algorithm to be executed almost simultaneously by starting walkers one timestep apart.

**14.    Long Distance Entanglement Generation in 2D Networks**  
S. Broadfoot, U. Dorner, D. Jaksch  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3584  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider 2D networks composed of nodes initially linked by two-qubit mixed states. In these networks we develop a global error correction scheme that can generate distance-independent entanglement from arbitrary network geometries using rank two states. By using this method and combining it with the concept of percolation we also show that the generation of long distance entanglement is possible with rank three states. Entanglement percolation and global error correction have different advantages depending on the given situation. To reveal the trade-off between them we consider their application on networks containing pure states. In doing so we find a range of pure-state schemes, each of which has applications in particular circumstances: For instance, we can identify a protocol for creating perfect entanglement between two distant nodes. However, this protocol can not generate a singlet between any two nodes. On the other hand, we can also construct schemes for creating entanglement between any nodes, but the corresponding entanglement fidelity is lower.

**15.    A scheme comparison of Autler-Townes based slow light in inhomogeneously broadened quantum dot media**  
Per Lunnemann, Jesper M?rk  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3826  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a method to achieve significant optical signal delays exploiting the effect of Autler-Townes splitting in an inhomogeneously broadened quantum dot medium. The absorption and slow-down effects are compared for three schemes i.e. $\Xi$, V and $\Lambda$, corresponding to different excitation configurations. Qualitative differences of the V-scheme compared to the $\Xi$- and $\Lambda$-scheme are found, which show that features of Autler-Townes splitting are only revealed in the V-scheme. The underlying physical mechanisms causing this discrepancy are analyzed and discussed. Finally we compare field propagation calculations of the schemes showing significantly larger achievable signal delays for the V-scheme despite finite absorption of the coupling field. This opens the possibility for using waveguide structures for both coupling and probe fields, thus significantly increasing the achievable signal delays.

**16.    Quantum walks: decoherence and coin-flipping games**  
Alejandro Romanelli, Guzmán Hernández  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3924  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the global chirality distribution of the quantum walk on the line when decoherence is introduced either through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle position, or as a result of broken links. The first mechanism drives the system towards a classical diffusive behavior. This is used to build new quantum games, similar to the spin-flip game. The second mechanism involves two different possibilities: (a) All the quantum walk links have the same probability of being broken. (b) Only the quantum walk links on a half-line are affected by random breakage. In case (a) the decoherence drives the system to a classical Markov process, whose master equation is equivalent to the dynamical equation of the quantum density matrix. This is not the case in (b) where the asymptotic global chirality distribution unexpectedly maintains some dependence with the initial condition. Explicit analytical equations are obtained for all cases.

**17.    Faithful nonclassicality indicators and extremal quantum correlations in two-qubit states**  
Davide Girolami, Mauro Paternostro, Gerardo Adesso  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 44, 352002 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4136  
<blockquote>
<p>
The state disturbance induced by locally measuring a quantum system yields a signature of nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement. Here we present a detailed study of such correlations for two-qubit mixed states. To overcome the asymmetry of quantum discord and the unfaithfulness of measurement-induced disturbance (severely overestimating quantum correlations), we propose an ameliorated measurement-induced disturbance as nonclassicality indicator, optimized over joint local measurements, and we derive its closed expression for relevant two-qubit states. We study its analytical relation with discord, and characterize the maximally quantum-correlated mixed states, that simultaneously extremize both quantifiers at given von Neumann entropy: among all two-qubit states, these states possess the most robust quantum correlations against noise.

Quantum Information and Computation 11 (2011) pp. 0485-0495  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5109  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study discrete-time quantum walks on a half line by means of spectral analysis. Cantero et al. [1] showed that the CMV matrix, which gives a recurrence relation for the orthogonal Laurent polynomials on the unit circle [2], expresses the dynamics of the quantum walk. Using the CGMV method introduced by them, the name is taken from their initials, we obtain the spectral measure for the quantum walk. As a corollary, we give another proof for localization of the quantum walk on homogeneous trees shown by Chisaki et al. [3].

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5121  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new form of a Parrondo game using discrete-time quantum walk on a line. The two players A and B with different quantum coins operators, individually losing the game can develop a strategy to emerge as joint winners by using their coins alternatively, or in combination for each step of the quantum walk evolution. We also present a strategy for a player A (B) to have a winning probability more than player B (A). Significance of the game strategy in information theory and physical applications are also discussed.

The problem of one-dimensional quantum wire along which a moving particle interacts with a linear array of N delta-function potentials is studied.

Some particular symmetries and invariances of the delta-function potential array for the N = 2 case are analyzed in detail. It is shown that perfect transmission can take place in a variety of situations.

<blockquote>
<p>
Using convex optimization, we propose entanglement-assisted quantum error correction procedures that are optimized for given noise channels. We demonstrate through numerical examples that such an optimized error correction method achieves higher channel fidelities than existing methods. This improved performance, which leads to perfect error correction for a larger class of error channels, is interpreted in at least some cases by quantum teleportation, but for general channels this interpretation does not hold.

<p>
In materials that do not allow birefringent phase-matching or periodic poling we propose to use waveguides to exploit the tensor structure of the second order nonlinearity for quasi-phase matching of nonlinear interactions. In particular, we concentrate on curved waveguides in which the interplay between the propagation direction, electric field polarizations and the nonlinearity can change the strength and sign of the nonlinear interaction periodically to achieve quasi-phase matching.

**23.    The McEliece Cryptosystem Resists Quantum Fourier Sampling Attacks**  
Hang Dinh, Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2390  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers can break the RSA and El Gamal public-key cryptosystems, since they can factor integers and extract discrete logarithms. If we believe that quantum computers will someday become a reality, we would like to have \emph{post-quantum} cryptosystems which can be implemented today with classical computers, but which will remain secure even in the presence of quantum attacks. In this article we show that the McEliece cryptosystem over \emph{well-permuted, well-scrambled} linear codes resists precisely the attacks to which the RSA and El Gamal cryptosystems are vulnerable---namely, those based on generating and measuring coset states. This eliminates the approach of strong Fourier sampling on which almost all known exponential speedups by quantum algorithms are based. Specifically, we show that the natural case of the Hidden Subgroup Problem to which the McEliece cryptosystem reduces cannot be solved by strong Fourier sampling, or by any measurement of a coset state. We start with recent negative results on quantum algorithms for Graph Isomorphism, which are based on particular subgroups of size two, and extend them to subgroups of arbitrary structure, including the automorphism groups of linear codes. This allows us to obtain the first rigorous results on the security of the McEliece cryptosystem in the face of quantum adversaries, strengthening its candidacy for post-quantum cryptography.

**24.    Quantum f-divergences and error correction**  
F. Hiai, M. Mosonyi, D. Petz, C. Beny  
Reviews in Mathematical Physics, volume 23, issue 7, pp. 691 -- 747, (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2529  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum f-divergences are a quantum generalization of the classical notion of f-divergences, and are a special case of Petz' quasi-entropies. Many well known distinguishability measures of quantum states are given by, or derived from, f-divergences; special examples include the quantum relative entropy, the Renyi relative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that the quantum f-divergences are monotonic under the dual of Schwarz maps whenever the defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all previously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the monotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility theorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability measures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and show that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a set of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be reversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the original one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for operator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main ingredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality and the case of equality. We also consider some special cases where the convexity of f is sufficient for the monotonicity, and obtain the inverse Holder inequality for operators as an application. The presentation is completely self-contained and requires only standard knowledge of matrix analysis.

<p>
One important way to characterize the states having a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken over multibands should be to look at their collective excitation modes. We find that a three-band system has multiple Leggett modes with significantly different masses, which can be classified into different dynamical classes according to whether multiple inter-band Josephson currents add or cancel. This provides a way to dynamically characterize multiband superconductivity while the pairing symmetry is a static property.

<p>
Absorption spectra of small molecular aggregates (oligomers) are considered. The dipole-dipole interaction between the monomers leads to shifts of the oligomer spectra with respect to the monomer absorption. The line-shapes of monomer as well as oligomer absorption depend strongly on the coupling to vibrational modes. Using a recently developed approach [Roden et. al, PRL 103, 058301] we investigate the length dependence of spectra of one-dimensional aggregates for various values of the interaction strength between the monomers. It is demonstrated, that the present approach is well suited to describe the occurrence of the J- and H-bands.

<p>
This paper develops a general method for constructing entanglement-assisted quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which is based on combinatorial design theory. Explicit constructions are given for entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) with many desirable properties. These properties include the requirement of only one initial entanglement bit, high error correction performance, high rates, and low decoding complexity. The proposed method produces infinitely many new codes with a wide variety of parameters and entanglement requirements. Our framework encompasses various codes including the previously known entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes having the best error correction performance and many new codes with better block error rates in simulations over the depolarizing channel. We also determine important parameters of several well-known classes of quantum and classical LDPC codes for previously unsettled cases.

Phys.Rev.D82:125007,2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4778  
<blockquote>
<p>
New exact results are given for the interior Casimir energies of infinitely long waveguides of triangular cross section (equilateral, hemiequilateral, and isosceles right triangles). Results for cylinders of rectangular cross section are rederived. In particular, results are obtained for interior modes belonging to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions (TM and TE modes). These results are expressed in rapidly convergent series using the Chowla-Selberg formula, and in fact may be given in closed form, except for general rectangles. The energies are finite because only the first three heat-kernel coefficients can be nonzero for the case of polygonal boundaries. What appears to be a universal behavior of the Casimir energy as a function of the shape of the regular or quasi-regular cross-sectional figure is presented. Furthermore, numerical calculations for arbitrary right triangular cross sections suggest that the universal behavior may be extended to waveguides of general polygonal cross sections. The new exact and numerical results are compared with the proximity force approximation (PFA).

http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5158  
<blockquote>
<p>
Mediated photon-photon interactions are realized in a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity coupled to a superconducting charge qubit. These non-resonant interactions blockade the transmission of photons through the cavity. This so-called dispersive photon blockade is characterized by measuring the total transmitted power while varying the energy spectrum of the photons incident on the cavity. A staircase with four distinct steps is observed and can be understood in an analogy with electron transport and the Coulomb blockade in quantum dots. This work differs from previous efforts in that the cavity-qubit excitations retain a photonic nature rather than a hybridization of qubit and photon and provides the needed tolerance to disorder for future condensed matter experiments.

**30.    Noise-enhanced trapping in chaotic scattering**  
Eduardo G. Altmann, Antonio Endler  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 205, 244102 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3935  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that noise enhances the trapping of trajectories in scattering systems. In fully chaotic systems, the decay rate can decrease with increasing noise due to a generic mismatch between the noiseless escape rate and the value predicted by the Liouville measure of the exit set. In Hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space we show that noise leads to a slower algebraic decay due to trajectories performing a random walk inside Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands. We argue that these noise-enhanced trapping mechanisms exist in most scattering systems and are likely to be dominant for small noise intensities, which is confirmed through a detailed investigation in the Henon map. Our results can be tested in fluid experiments, affect the fractal Weyl's law of quantum systems, and modify the estimations of chemical reaction rates based on phase-space transition state theory.

We derive exactly the single-photon and two-photon current (transmission) for linear and nonlinear (tight-binding sinusoidal) energy-momentum dispersion relations of photons in the waveguides and compare the results for the different dispersions. A large enhancement of the two-photon current for the sinusoidal dispersion has been seen at a certain transition energy of the TLS away from the single-photon resonances.
