**1.    Non-Markovian Quantum Trajectories of Many-Body Quantum Open Systems**  
Jun Jing, Xinyu Zhao, J. Q. You, W. T. Strunz, Ting Yu

<blockquote>
<p>
A long-standing open problem in non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) approach to open quantum systems is to establish the non-Markovian QSD equations for multiple qubit systems. In this paper, we settle this important question by explicitly constructing a set of exact time-local QSD equations for $N$-qubit systems. Our exact time-local (convolutionless) QSD equations have paved the way towards simulating quantum dynamics of many-body open systems interacting with a common bosonic environment. The applicability of this multiple-qubit stochastic equation is exemplified by numerically solving several quantum open many-body systems concerning quantum coherence dynamics and dynamical control.

**2.    Constructions and Noise Threshold of Topological Subsystem Codes**

<blockquote>
<p>
Topological subsystem codes proposed recently by Bombin are quantum error correcting codes defined on a two-dimensional grid of qubits that permit reliable quantum information storage with a constant error threshold. These codes require only the measurement of two-qubit nearest-neighbor operators for error correction. In this paper we demonstrate that topological subsystem codes (TSCs) can be viewed as generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model to trivalent hypergraphs. This new connection provides a systematic way of constructing TSCs and analyzing their properties. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which a syndrome measurement in a subsystem code can be reduced to measurements of the gauge group generators. Furthermore, we propose and implement some candidate decoding algorithms for one particular TSC assuming perfect error correction. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that this code, which we call the five-squares code, has a threshold against depolarizing noise of at least 2%.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum superposition and entanglement of physical states can be harnessed to solve some problems which are intractable on a classical computer implementing binary logic. Several algorithms have been proposed to utilize the quantum nature of physical states and solve important problems. For example, Shor's quantum algorithm is extremely important in the field of cryptography since it factors large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. Another celebrated example is the Grovers quantum algorithm. These algorithms can only be implemented on a quantum computer which operates on quantum bits (qubits). Rudimentary implementations of quantum processor have already been achieved through linear optical components, ion traps, NMR etc. However demonstration of a solid state quantum processor had been elusive till DiCarlo et al demonstrated two qubit algorithms in superconducting quantum processor. Though this has been a significant step, scalable semiconductor based room temperature quantum computing is yet to be found. Such a technology could benefit from the vast experience of the semiconductor industry. Hence, here we present a reconfigurable semiconductor quantum logic device (SQuaLD) which operates on the position and spin degree of freedom of the electrons in the device. Based on a few recent experiments, we believe SQuaLD is experimentally feasible. Moreover, using a well known quantum simulation method, we show that quantum algorithms (such as Deutsch Jozsa, Grover search) as well as universal classical logic operations (such as NAND gate) can be implemented in SQuaLD. Thus, we argue that SQuaLD is a strong candidate for the future quantum logic processor since it also satisfies the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum logic application as well as the five essential characteristics for classical logic applications.

**4.    Markov entropy decomposition: a variational dual for quantum belief propagation**  
David Poulin, Matthew B. Hastings  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 080403 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2050  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a lower bound for the free energy of a quantum many-body system at finite temperature. This lower bound is expressed as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, and is derived using strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy and a relaxation of the consistency condition of local density operators. The dual to this minimization problem leads to a set of quantum belief propagation equations, thus providing a firm theoretical foundation to that approach. The minimization problem is numerically tractable, and we find good agreement with quantum Monte Carlo for the spin-half Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet in two dimensions. This lower bound complements other variational upper bounds. We discuss applications to Hamiltonian complexity theory and give a generalization of the structure theorem of Hayden, Jozsa, Petz and Winter to trees in an appendix.

**5.    Symmetry-assisted adversaries for quantum state generation**  
Andris Ambainis, Lo?ck Magnin, Martin Roetteler, Jérémie Roland  
26th IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'11), pages 167-177, 2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2112  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a new quantum adversary method to prove lower bounds on the query complexity of the quantum state generation problem. This problem encompasses both, the computation of partial or total functions and the preparation of target quantum states. There has been hope for quite some time that quantum state generation might be a route to tackle the {\sc Graph Isomorphism} problem. We show that for the related problem of {\sc Index Erasure} our method leads to a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt N)$ which matches an upper bound obtained via reduction to quantum search on $N$ elements. This closes an open problem first raised by Shi [FOCS'02]. Our approach is based on two ideas: (i) on the one hand we generalize the known additive and multiplicative adversary methods to the case of quantum state generation, (ii) on the other hand we show how the symmetries of the underlying problem can be leveraged for the design of optimal adversary matrices and dramatically simplify the computation of adversary bounds. Taken together, these two ideas give the new result for {\sc Index Erasure} by using the representation theory of the symmetric group. Also, the method can lead to lower bounds even for small success probability, contrary to the standard adversary method. Furthermore, we answer an open question due to \v{S}palek [CCC'08] by showing that the multiplicative version of the adversary method is stronger than the additive one for any problem. Finally, we prove that the multiplicative bound satisfies a strong direct product theorem, extending a result by \v{S}palek to quantum state generation problems.

**6.    Quantum walks on complex networks with connection instabilities and community structure**  
Dimitris I. Tsomokos  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 052315 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2405  
<blockquote>
<p>
A continuous-time quantum walk is investigated on complex networks with the characteristic property of community structure, which is shared by most real-world networks. Motivated by the prospect of viable quantum networks, I focus on the effects of network instabilities in the form of broken links, and examine the response of the quantum walk to such failures. It is shown that the reconfiguration of the quantum walk is determined by the community structure of the network. In this context, quantum walks based on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of the network are compared, and their responses to link failures is analyzed.

**7.    Quantum property testing for bounded-degree graphs**  
Andris Ambainis, Andrew M. Childs, Yi-Kai Liu  
Proceedings of RANDOM 2011, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6845, pp. 365-376  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3174  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum algorithms for testing bipartiteness and expansion of bounded-degree graphs. We give quantum algorithms that solve these problems in time O(N^(1/3)), beating the Omega(sqrt(N)) classical lower bound. For testing expansion, we also prove an Omega(N^(1/4)) quantum query lower bound, thus ruling out the possibility of an exponential quantum speedup. Our quantum algorithms follow from a combination of classical property testing techniques due to Goldreich and Ron, derandomization, and the quantum algorithm for element distinctness. The quantum lower bound is obtained by the polynomial method, using novel algebraic techniques and combinatorial analysis to accommodate the graph structure.

**8.    Strongly interacting photons in hollow-core waveguides**  
Ephraim Shahmoon, Gershon Kurizki, Michael Fleischhauer, David Petrosyan  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 033806 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3601  
<blockquote>
<p>
Hollow-core photonic-crystal waveguides filled with cold atoms can support giant optical nonlinearities through nondispersive propagation of light tightly confined in the transverse direction. Here we explore electromagnetically induced transparency is such structures, considering a pair of counter-propagating weak quantum fields in the medium of coherently driven atoms in the ladder configuration. Strong dipole--dipole interactions between optically excited, polarized Rydberg states of the atoms translate into a large dispersive interaction between the two fields. This can be used to attain a spatially-homogeneous conditional phase shift of pi for two single-photon pulses, realizing a deterministic photonic phase gate, or to implement a quantum nondemolition measurement of the photon number in the signal pulse by a coherent probe, thereby achieving a heralded source of single or few photon pulses.

**9.    Halving the Casimir force with conductive oxides: experimental details**  
Sven de Man, Kier Heeck, Davide Iannuzzi  
Phys. Rev. A82 (2010) 062512  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3831  
<blockquote>
<p>
This work is an extended version of a paper published last year in Physical Review Letters [S. de Man et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 040402 (2009)], where we presented measurements of the Casimir force between a gold coated sphere and a plate coated with either gold or an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The experiment, which was performed in air, showed that ITO is sufficiently conducting to prevent charge accumulation, but still transparent enough to halve the Casimir attraction when compared to gold. Here, we report all the experimental details that, due to the limited space available, were omitted in the previous article. We discuss the performance of our setup in terms of stability of the calibration procedure and reproducibility of the Casimir force measurement. We also introduce and demonstrate a new technique to obtain the spring constant of our force sensor. Furthermore, we present a thorough description of the experimental method, a comprehensive explanation of data elaboration and error analysis, and a complete characterization of the dielectric function and of the surface roughness of the samples used in the actual experiment.

**10.    Constructing elliptic curve isogenies in quantum subexponential time**  
Andrew M. Childs, David Jao, Vladimir Soukharev  
J. Math. Cryptol., 8(1):1-29, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4019  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given two elliptic curves over a finite field having the same cardinality and endomorphism ring, it is known that the curves admit an isogeny between them, but finding such an isogeny is believed to be computationally difficult. The fastest known classical algorithm takes exponential time, and prior to our work no faster quantum algorithm was known. Recently, public-key cryptosystems based on the presumed hardness of this problem have been proposed as candidates for post-quantum cryptography. In this paper, we give a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (but with no other assumptions). Our algorithm is based on a reduction to a hidden shift problem, together with a new subexponential-time algorithm for evaluating isogenies from kernel ideals (under only GRH), and represents the first nontrivial application of Kuperberg's quantum algorithm for the hidden shift problem. This result suggests that isogeny-based cryptosystems may be uncompetitive with more mainstream quantum-resistant cryptosystems such as lattice-based cryptosystems.

**11.    The decoherence dynamics of the multipartite entanglement in non-Markovian environment**  
Zhi He, Jian Zou, Bin Shao, Shu-Yan Kong  
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 (2010) 115503  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4141  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider four two-level atoms interacting with independent non-Markovian reservoirs with detuning. We mainly investigate the effects of the detuning and the length of the reservoir correlation time on the decoherence dynamics of the multipartite entanglement. We find that the time evolution of the entanglement of atomic and reservoir subsystems is determined by a parameter, which is a function of the detuning and the reservoir correlation time. We also find that the decay and revival of the entanglement of the atomic and reservoir subsystems are closely related to the sign of the decay rate. We also show that the cluster state is the most robust to decoherence comparing with Dicke, GHZ, and W states for this decoherence channel

**12.    Entanglement for discrete-time quantum walks on the line**  
Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno, Takuya Machida  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol.11 No.9&10, pp.855-866 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4164  
<blockquote>
<p>
The discrete-time quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the random walk. It is expected that the model plays important roles in the quantum field. In the quantum information theory, entanglement is a key resource. We use the von Neumann entropy to measure the entanglement between the coin and the particle's position of the quantum walks. Also we deal with the Shannon entropy which is an important quantity in the information theory. In this paper, we show limits of the von Neumann entropy and the Shannon entropy of the quantum walks on the one dimensional lattice starting from the origin defined by arbitrary coin and initial state. In order to derive these limits, we use the path counting method which is a combinatorial method for computing probability amplitude.

**13.    Ground state factorization and correlations with broken symmetry**  
Bruno Tomasello, Davide Rossini, Alioscia Hamma, Luigi Amico  
Europhys. Lett. 96, 27002 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4270  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how the phenomenon of factorization in a quantum many body system is of collective nature. To this aim we study the quantum discord $Q$ in the one dimensional XY model in a transverse field. We analyze the behavior of $Q$ at both the critical point and at the non critical factorizing field. The factorization is found to be governed by an exponential scaling law for $Q$. We also address the thermal effects fanning out from the anomalies occurring at zero temperature. Close to the quantum phase transition, $Q$ exhibits a finite-temperature crossover with universal scaling behavior, while the factorization phenomenon results in a non trivial pattern of correlations present at low temperature.

**14.    Measurement-induced disturbances and nonclassical correlations of Gaussian states**  
Ladislav Mi?ta, Jr., Richard Tatham, Davide Girolami, Natalia Korolkova, Gerardo Adesso  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 042325 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4302  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum correlations beyond entanglement in two-mode Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, by means of the measurement-induced disturbance (MID) and its ameliorated version (AMID). In analogy with the recent studies of the Gaussian quantum discord, we define a Gaussian AMID by constraining the optimization to all bi-local Gaussian positive operator valued measurements. We solve the optimization explicitly for relevant families of states, including squeezed thermal states. Remarkably, we find that there is a finite subset of two-mode Gaussian states, comprising pure states, where non-Gaussian measurements such as photon counting are globally optimal for the AMID and realize a strictly smaller state disturbance compared to the best Gaussian measurements. However, for the majority of two--mode Gaussian states the unoptimized MID provides a loose overestimation of the actual content of quantum correlations, as evidenced by its comparison with Gaussian discord. This feature displays strong similarity with the case of two qubits. Upper and lower bounds for the Gaussian AMID at fixed Gaussian discord are identified. We further present a comparison between Gaussian AMID and Gaussian entanglement of formation, and classify families of two-mode states in terms of their Gaussian AMID, Gaussian discord, and Gaussian entanglement of formation. Our findings provide a further confirmation of the genuinely quantum nature of general Gaussian states, yet they reveal that non-Gaussian measurements can play a crucial role for the optimized extraction and potential exploitation of classical and nonclassical correlations in Gaussian states.

**15.    An effective method of calculating the non-Markovianity $\mathcal{N}$ for single channel open systems**  
Zhi He, Jian Zou, Lin Li, Bin Shao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4328  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an effective method which can simplify the optimization of the increase of the trace distance over all pairs of initial states in calculating the non-Markovianity $\mathcal{N}$ for single channel open systems. For the amplitude damping channel, we can unify the results of Breuer $et$ $al$. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \bf 103\rm, 210401 (2009)] in the large-detuning case and the results of Xu $et$ $al$. [Phys. Rev. A \bf 81\rm, 044105 (2010)] in the resonant case; furthermore, for the general off-resonant cases we can obtain a very tight lower bound of $\mathcal{N}$. As another application of our method, we also discuss $\mathcal{N}$ for the non-Markovian depolarizing channel.

**16.    The robust $\mP\mT$-symmetric chain and properties of its Hermitian counterpart**  
Yogesh N. Joglekar, Avadh Saxena  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 050101(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4475  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the properties of a parity- and time-reversal- (PT) symmetric tight-binding chain of size N with position-dependent hopping amplitude. In contrast to the fragile PT-symmetric phase of a chain with constant hopping and imaginary impurity potentials, we show that, under very general conditions, our model is {\it always} in the PT-symmetric phase. We numerically obtain the energy spectrum and the density of states of such a chain, and show that they are widely tunable. By studying the size-dependence of inverse participation ratios, we show that although the chain is not translationally invariant, most of its eigenstates are extended. Our results indicate that tight-binding models with non-Hermitian PT-symmetric hopping have a robust PT-symmetric phase and rich dynamics which may be explored in coupled waveguides.

<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete-time quantum walk evolve by a unitary operator which involves two operators a conditional shift in position space and a coin operator. This operator entangles the coin and position degrees of freedom of the walker. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the coin position entanglement (CPE) for an inhomogeneous quantum walk which determined by two orthogonal matrices in one-dimensional lattice. Free parameters of coin operator together provide many conditions under which a measurement perform on the coin state yield the value of entanglement on the resulting position quantum state. We study the problem analytically for all values that two free parameters of coin operator can take and the conditions under which entanglement becomes maximal are sought.

We experimentally demonstrate the nonlocal reversal of a partial-collapse quantum measurement on two-photon entangled state. Both the partial measurement and the reversal operation are implemented in linear optics with two displaced Sagnac interferometers, which are characterized by single qubit quantum process tomography. The recovered state is measured by quantum state tomography and its nonlocality is characterized by testing the Bell inequality. Our result will be helpful in quantum communication and quantum error correction.

**19.    Quantumness of noisy quantum walks: a comparison between measurement-induced disturbance and quantum discord**  
Balaji R. Rao, R. Srikanth, C. M. Chandrashekar, Subhashish Banerjee  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 064302 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5040  
<blockquote>
<p>
Noisy quantum walks are studied from the perspective of comparing their quantumness as defined by two popular measures, measurement-induced disturbance (MID) and quantum discord (QD). While the former has an operational definition, unlike the latter, it also tends to overestimate non-classicality because of a lack of optimization over local measurements. Applied to quantum walks, we find that MID, while acting as a loose upper bound on QD, still tends to reflect correctly the trends in the behavior of the latter. However, there are regimes where its behavior is not indicative of non-classicality: in particular, we find an instance where MID increases with the application of noise, where we expect a reduction of quantumness.

**20.    Non-Markovian Dynamics and Entanglement of Two-level Atoms in a Common Field**  
C. H. Fleming, N. I. Cummings, Charis Anastopoulos, B. L. Hu  
J. Phys. A. 45, 065301 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5067  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive the stochastic equations and consider the non-Markovian dynamics of a system of multiple two-level atoms in a common quantum field. We make only the dipole approximation for the atoms and assume weak atom-field interactions. From these assumptions we use a combination of non-secular open- and closed-system perturbation theory, and we abstain from any additional approximation schemes. These more accurate solutions are necessary to explore several regimes: in particular, near-resonance dynamics and low-temperature behavior. In detuned atomic systems, small variations in the system energy levels engender timescales which, in general, cannot be safely ignored, as would be the case in the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). More problematic are the second-order solutions, which, as has been recently pointed out, cannot be accurately calculated using any second-order perturbative master equation, whether RWA, Born-Markov, Redfield, etc.. This latter problem, which applies to all perturbative open-system master equations, has a profound effect upon calculation of entanglement at low temperatures. We find that even at zero temperature all initial states will undergo finite-time disentanglement (sometimes termed "sudden death"), in contrast to previous work. We also use our solution, without invoking RWA, to characterize the necessary conditions for Dickie subradiance at finite temperature. We find that the subradiant states fall into two categories at finite temperature: one that is temperature independent and one that acquires temperature dependence. With the RWA there is no temperature dependence in any case.

In this paper, we investigate a characterization of Quantum Mechanics by two physical principles based on general probabilistic theories. We first give the operationally motivated definition of the physical equivalence of states and consider the principle of the physical equivalence of pure states, which turns out to be equivalent to the symmetric structure of the state space. We further consider another principle of the decomposability with distinguishable pure states. We give classification theorems of the state spaces for each principle, and derive the Bloch ball in 2 and 3 dimensional systems by these principles.

PbS quantum dots are promising active emitters for use with high-quality Si nanophotonic devices in the telecommunications-band. Measurements of low quantum dot densities are limited both because of low fluorescence levels and the challenges of single photon detection at these wavelengths.

Temperature dependent ensemble measurements reveal an increase in emitted photons concomitant with an increase in excited-state lifetime from 58.9 ns at 293 K to 657 ns at 40 K. Measurements are also performed on quantum dots on high-$Q$ ($>10^5$) microdisks using cavity-resonant, pulsed excitation.

<p>
Current generations of graphics processing units have turned into highly parallel devices with general computing capabilities. Thus, graphics processing units may be utilized, for example, to solve time dependent partial differential equations by the Fourier split operator method. In this contribution, we demonstrate that graphics processing units are capable to calculate fast Fourier transforms much more efficiently than traditional central processing units. Thus, graphics processing units render efficient implementations of the Fourier split operator method possible. Performance gains of more than an order of magnitude as compared to implementations for traditional central processing units are reached in the solution of the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation and the time dependent Dirac equation.

<p>
Broadband homodyne detection of the light transmitted by a Fabry-Perot cavity containing a strongly-coupled $^{133}$Cs atom is used to probe the dynamic optical response in a regime where semiclassical theory predicts bistability but strong quantum corrections should apply. While quantum fluctuations destabilize true equilibrium bistability, our observations confirm the existence of metastable states with finite lifetimes and a hysteretic response is apparent when the optical drive is modulated on comparable timescales. Our experiment elucidates remnant semiclassical behavior in the attojoule ($\sim10$ photon) regime of single-atom cavity QED, of potential significance for ultra-low power photonic signal processing.

<p>
The goal of the presented paper is to provide an introduction to the basic computational models used in quantum information theory. We review various models of quantum Turing machine, quantum circuits and quantum random access machine (QRAM) along with their classical counterparts. We also provide an introduction to quantum programming languages, which are developed using the QRAM model. We review the syntax of several existing quantum programming languages and discuss their features and limitations.
