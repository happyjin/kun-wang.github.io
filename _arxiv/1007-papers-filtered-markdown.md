**1.    Optical Probe of Quantum Shot Noise Reduction at a Single-Atom Contact**  
Natalia L. Schneider, Guillaume Schull, Richard Berndt  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0095  
<blockquote>
<p>
Visible and infra-red light emitted at a Ag-Ag(111) junction has been investigated from tunneling to single atom contact conditions with a scanning tunneling microscope. The light intensity varies in a highly nonlinear fashion with the conductance of the junction and exhibits a minimum at conductances close to the conductance quantum. The data are interpreted in terms of current noise at optical frequencies, which is characteristic of partially open transport channels.

**2.    Fisher information and asymptotic normality in system identification for quantum Markov chains**  
Madalin Guta  
Phys. Rev. A, 83, 062324, (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0434  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper deals with the problem of estimating the coupling constant $\theta$ of a mixing quantum Markov chain. For a repeated measurement on the chain's output we show that the outcomes' time average has an asymptotically normal (Gaussian) distribution, and we give the explicit expressions of its mean and variance. In particular we obtain a simple estimator of $\theta$ whose classical Fisher information can be optimized over different choices of measured observables. We then show that the quantum state of the output together with the system, is itself asymptotically Gaussian and compute its quantum Fisher information which sets an absolute bound to the estimation error. The classical and quantum Fisher informations are compared in a simple example. In the vicinity of $\theta=0$ we find that the quantum Fisher information has a quadratic rather than linear scaling in output size, and asymptotically the Fisher information is localised in the system, while the output is independent of the parameter.

**3.    Programmable purification of type-I polarization-entanglement**  
Simone Cialdi, Davide Brivio, Matteo G A Paris  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 97 041108 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0505  
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest and demonstrate a scheme to compensate spatial and spectral decoherence effects in the generation of polarization entangled states by type-I parametric downconversion. In our device a programmable spatial light modulator imposes a polarization dependent phase-shift on different spatial sections of the overall downconversion output and this effect is exploited to realize an effective purification technique for polarization entanglement.

**4.    The dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting microwave circuits**  
J.R. Johansson, G. Johansson, C.M. Wilson, Franco Nori  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 052509 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1058  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically investigate the dynamical Casimir effect in electrical circuits based on superconducting microfabricated waveguides with tunable boundary conditions. We propose to implement a rapid modulation of the boundary conditions by tuning the applied magnetic flux through superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that are embedded in the waveguide circuits. We consider two circuits: (i) An open waveguide circuit that corresponds to a single mirror in free space, and (ii) a resonator coupled to a microfabricated waveguide, which corresponds to a single-sided cavity in free space. We analyze the properties of the dynamical Casimir effect in these two setups by calculating the generated photon-flux density, output-field correlation functions, and the quadrature squeezing spectra. We show that these properties of the output field exhibit signatures unique to the radiation due to the dynamical Casimir effect, and could therefore be used for distinguishing the dynamical Casimir effect from other types of radiation in these circuits. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the dynamical Casimir effect, in the resonator setup, and downconversion of pump photons in parametric oscillators.

**5.    Zeno subspace in quantum-walk dynamics**  
C. M. Chandrashekar  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 052108 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1303  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the discrete-time quantum walk evolution under the influence of the periodic measurements in position subspace. The undisturbed survival probability of the particle at the position subspace, $P(0, t)$ is compared with the survival probability after frequent ($n$) measurements at interval $\tau = t/n$, $P(0, \tau)^n$. We show that $P(0, \tau)^n > P(0, t)$ leading to the quantum Zeno effect in the position subspace when a parameter $\theta$ in the quantum coin operations and frequency of measurements is greater than the critical value, $\theta > \theta_{c}$ and $n>n_{c}$. This Zeno effect in the subspace preserves the dynamics in coin Hilbert space of the walk dynamics and has a potential to play a significant role in quantum tasks such as, preserving the quantum state of the particle at any particular position and to understand the Zeno dynamics in a multidimensional system which is highly transient in nature.

**6.    Sensitivity of Quantum Walks with Perturbation**  
Chen-Fu Chiang  
Proceedings of the 10th Asian Conference on Quantum Information Science, pp. 209-210, (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1415  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers are susceptible to noises from the outside world. We investigate the effect of perturbation on the hitting time of a quantum walk and the stationary distribution prepared by a quantum walk based algorithm. The perturbation comes from quantizing a transition matrix Q with perturbation E (errors). We bound the perturbed quantum walk hitting time from above by applying Szegedy's work and the perturbation bounds with Weyl's perturbation theorem on classical matrix. Based on an efficient quantum sample preparation approach invented in {\em speed-up via quantum sampling} and the perturbation bounds for stationary distribution for classical matrix, we find an upper bound for the total variation distance between the prepared quantum sample and the true quantum sample.

**7.    Information Reconciliation for Quantum Key Distribution**  
David Elkouss, Jesus Martinez-Mateo, Vicente Martin  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 11, No. 3&4 (2011) 0226-0238  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1616  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on quantum and classical procedures in order to achieve the growing of a secret random string -the key- known only to the two parties executing the protocol. Limited intrinsic efficiency of the protocol, imperfect devices and eavesdropping produce errors and information leakage from which the set of measured signals -the raw key- must be stripped in order to distill a final, information theoretically secure, key. The key distillation process is a classical one in which basis reconciliation, error correction and privacy amplification protocols are applied to the raw key. This cleaning process is known as information reconciliation and must be done in a fast and efficient way to avoid cramping the performance of the QKD system. Brassard and Salvail proposed a very simple and elegant protocol to reconcile keys in the secret-key agreement context, known as Cascade, that has become the de-facto standard for all QKD practical implementations. However, it is highly interactive, requiring many communications between the legitimate parties and its efficiency is not optimal, imposing an early limit to the maximum tolerable error rate. In this paper we describe a low-density parity-check reconciliation protocol that improves significantly on these problems. The protocol exhibits better efficiency and limits the number of uses of the communications channel. It is also able to adapt to different error rates while remaining efficient, thus reaching longer distances or higher secure key rate for a given QKD system.

**8.    Can reactive coupling beat motional quantum limit of nano waveguides coupled to microdisk resonator**  
Sumei Huang, G. S. Agarwal  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 033811 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1620  
<blockquote>
<p>
Dissipation is generally thought to affect the quantum nature of the system in an adverse manner, however we show that dissipatively coupled nano systems can be prepared in states which beat the standard quantum limit of the mechanical motion. We show that the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the microdisk resonator can generate the squeezing of the waveguide by injecting a quantum field and laser into the resonator through the waveguide. The waveguide can show about 70--75% of maximal squeezing for temperature about 1--10 mK. The maximum squeezing can be achieved with incident pump power of only 12 $\mu$W for a temperature of about 1 mK. Even for temperatures of 20 mK, achievable by dilution refrigerators, the maximum squeezing is about 60%.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1690  
<blockquote>
<p>
Minimizing phase and other errors in experimental quantum gates allows higher fidelity quantum processing. To quantify and correct for phase errors in particular, we have developed a new experimental metrology --- amplified phase error (APE) pulses --- that amplifies and helps identify phase errors in general multi-level qubit architectures. In order to correct for both phase and amplitude errors specific to virtual transitions and leakage outside of the qubit manifold, we implement "half derivative" an experimental simplification of derivative reduction by adiabatic gate (DRAG) control theory. The phase errors are lowered by about a factor of five using this method to $\sim 1.6^{\circ}$ per gate, and can be tuned to zero. Leakage outside the qubit manifold, to the qubit $|2\rangle$ state, is also reduced to $\sim 10^{-4}$ for $20\%$ faster gates.

**10.    Lower Bounds for Quantum Oblivious Transfer**  
André Chailloux, Iordanis Kerenidis, Jamie Sikora  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1875  
<blockquote>
<p>
Oblivious transfer is a fundamental primitive in cryptography. While perfect information theoretic security is impossible, quantum oblivious transfer protocols can limit the dishonest players' cheating. Finding the optimal security parameters in such protocols is an important open question. In this paper we show that every 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol allows a dishonest party to cheat with probability bounded below by a constant strictly larger than 1/2. Alice's cheating is defined as her probability of guessing Bob's index, and Bob's cheating is defined as his probability of guessing both input bits of Alice. In our proof, we relate these cheating probabilities to the cheating probabilities of a coin flipping protocol and conclude by using Kitaev's coin flipping lower bound. Then, we present an oblivious transfer protocol with two messages and cheating probabilities at most 3/4. Last, we extend Kitaev's semidefinite programming formulation to more general primitives, where the security is against a dishonest player trying to force the outcome of the other player, and prove optimal lower and upper bounds for them.

**11.    Observation of two-photon absorption at low power levels using tapered optical fibers in rubidium vapor**

Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 173602 (2010)

<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear optical effects can be enhanced in tapered optical fibers with diameters less than the wavelength of the propagating light. Here we report on the observation of two-photon absorption using tapered fibers in rubidium vapor at power levels of less than 150 nW. Transit-time broadening produces two-photon absorption spectra with sharp peaks that are very different from conventional line shapes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2219  
<blockquote>
<p>
A major challenge in the field of quantum computing is the construction of scalable qubit coupling architectures. Here, we demonstrate a novel tuneable coupling circuit that allows superconducting qubits to be coupled over long distances. We show that the inter-qubit coupling strength can be arbitrarily tuned over nanosecond timescales within a sequence that mimics actual use in an algorithm. The coupler has a measured on/off ratio of 1000. The design is self-contained and physically separate from the qubits, allowing the coupler to be used as a module to connect a variety of elements such as qubits, resonators, amplifiers, and readout circuitry over long distances. Such design flexibility is likely to be essential for a scalable quantum computer.

**13.    Heralded generation of entangled photon pairs**  
Stefanie Barz, Gunther Cronenberg, Anton Zeilinger, Philip Walther  
Nature Photonics 4, 553-556 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2745  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entangled photons are a crucial resource for quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation. Unfortunately, the applicability of many photon-based schemes is limited due to the stochastic character of the photon sources. Therefore, a worldwide effort has focused in overcoming the limitation of probabilistic emission by generating two-photon entangled states conditioned on the detection of auxiliary photons. Here we present the first heralded generation of photon states that are maximally entangled in polarization with linear optics and standard photon detection from spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We utilize the down-conversion state corresponding to the generation of three photon pairs, where the coincident detection of four auxiliary photons unambiguously heralds the successful preparation of the entangled state. This controlled generation of entangled photon states is a significant step towards the applicability of a linear optics quantum network, in particular for entanglement swapping, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and scalable approaches towards photonics-based quantum computing.

**14.    Fault-tolerance of ancilla preparation for logical Toffoli gate of a family of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes**  
Daisuke Aratsu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2869  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fault-tolerant quantum computation using quantum error-correcting codes requires fault-tolerant constructions of nontransversal gates. Shor proposed a fault-tolerant construction of a nontransversal gate, i.e., the Toffoli gate for a family of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes which has even-weight stabilizer generators and odd-weight logical operators. In fact, as shown in this paper, error propagations in the ancilla preparation of Shor's construction lead to logical errors. This work provides a solution to this problem through the insertion of bit flip error correction. Finally, error rates of a modified construction are evaluated with use of the concatenated Steane codes, and the same accuracy threshold as transversal gates is obtained in cases where ancillary systems can be prepared just in time.

**15.    Generation of squeezed light with monolithic optical parametric oscillator: Simultaneous achievement of phase matching and cavity resonance by temperature control**  
Hidehiro Yonezawa, Koyo Nagashima, Akira Furusawa  
Optics Express Vol. 18, Iss. 19, pp. 20143-20150 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2995  
<blockquote>
<p>
We generate squeezed state of light at 860 nm with a monolithic optical parametric oscillator. The optical parametric oscillator consists of a periodically poled KTiOPO_4 crystal, both ends of which are spherically polished and mirror-coated. We achieve both phase matching and cavity resonance by controlling only the temperature of the crystal. We observe up to -8.0 dB of squeezing with the bandwidth of 142 MHz. Our technique makes it possible to drive many monolithic cavities simultaneously by a single laser. Hence our monolithic optical parametric oscillator is quite suitable to continuous-variable quantum information experiments where we need a large number of highly squeezed light beams.

**16.    On the von Neumann entropy of certain quantum walks subject to decoherence**

Math. Struct. in Comp. Science (2010), vol. 20, pp. 1099-1115  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3057  
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a discrete-time quantum walk on the $N$-cycle governed by the following condition: at every time step of the walk, the option persists, with probability $p$, of exercising a projective measurement on the coin degree of freedom. For a bipartite quantum system of this kind, we prove that the von Neumann entropy of the total density operator converges to its maximum value. Thus, when influenced by decoherence, the mutual information between the two subsystems, corresponding respectively to the space of the coin and the space of the walker, eventually must diminish to zero. To put it plainly, any level of decoherence greater than zero forces the system eventually to become completely "disentangled".}

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concept of a quantum pulse gate (QPG), a method for accessing the intrinsic broadband spectral mode structure of ultrafast quantum states of light. This mode structure can now be harnessed for applications in quantum information processing. We propose an implementation in a PPLN waveguide, based on spectrally engineered sum frequency generation (SFG). It allows us to pick well-defined spectral broadband modes from an ultrafast multi-mode state for interconversion to a broadband mode at another frequency. By pulse-shaping the bright SFG pump beam, different orthogonal broadband modes can be addressed individually and extracted with near unit efficiency.

**18.    Photonic circuits for generating modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement**

Photonics Journal, IEEE 2, 736-752, (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3242  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the design of photonic circuits that make use of Ti:LiNbO$_{3}$ diffused channel waveguides for generating photons with various combinations of modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement. Down-converted photon pairs are generated via spontaneous optical parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a two-mode waveguide. We study a class of photonic circuits comprising: 1) a nonlinear periodically poled two-mode waveguide structure, 2) a set of single-mode and two-mode waveguide-based couplers arranged in such a way that they suitably separate the three photons comprising the SPDC process, and, for some applications, 3) a holographic Bragg grating that acts as a dichroic reflector. The first circuit produces frequency-degenerate down-converted photons, each with even spatial parity, in two separate single-mode waveguides. Changing the parameters of the elements allows this same circuit to produce two nondegenerate down-converted photons that are entangled in frequency or simultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization. The second photonic circuit is designed to produce modal entanglement by distinguishing the photons on the basis of their frequencies. A modified version of this circuit can be used to generate photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and polarization. The third photonic circuit is designed to manage dispersion by converting modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement into path entanglement.

**19.    Modal and Polarization Qubits in Ti:LiNbO$_3$ Photonic Circuits for a Universal Quantum Logic Gate**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3256  
<blockquote>
<p>
Lithium niobate photonic circuits have the salutary property of permitting the generation, transmission, and processing of photons to be accommodated on a single chip. Compact photonic circuits such as these, with multiple components integrated on a single chip, are crucial for efficiently implementing quantum information processing schemes. We present a set of basic transformations that are useful for manipulating modal qubits in Ti:LiNbO$_3$ photonic quantum circuits. These include the mode analyzer, a device that separates the even and odd components of a state into two separate spatial paths; the mode rotator, which rotates the state by an angle in mode space; and modal Pauli spin operators that effect related operations. We also describe the design of a deterministic, two-qubit, single-photon, CNOT gate, a key element in certain sets of universal quantum logic gates. It is implemented as a Ti:LiNbO$_3$ photonic quantum circuit in which the polarization and mode number of a single photon serve as the control and target qubits, respectively. It is shown that the effects of dispersion in the CNOT circuit can be mitigated by augmenting it with an additional path. The performance of all of these components are confirmed by numerical simulations. The implementation of these transformations relies on selective and controllable power coupling among single- and two-mode waveguides, as well as the polarization sensitivity of the Pockels coefficients in LiNbO$_3$.

**21.    Non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time correlation functions of system operators of a pure-dephasing model**  
Hsi-Sheng Goan, Chung-Chin Jian, Po-Wen Chen  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 012111 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3791  
<blockquote>
<p>
We evaluate the non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time correlation functions (CF's) of system operators of a pure-dephasing spin-boson model in two different ways, one by the direct exact operator technique and the other by the recently derived evolution equations, valid to second order in the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian. This pure-dephasing spin-boson model that is exactly solvable has been extensively studied as a simple decoherence model. However, its exact non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time system operator CF's, to our knowledge, have not been presented in the literature. This may be mainly due to the fact, illustrated in this article, that in contrast to the Markovian case, the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system (or the reduced quantum master equation) alone is not sufficient to calculate the two-time system operator CF's of non-Markovian open systems. The two-time CF's obtained using the recently derived evolution equations in the weak system-environment coupling case for this non-Markovian pure-dephasing model happen to be the same as those obtained from the exact evaluation. However, these results significantly differ from the non-Markovian two-time CF's obtained by wrongly directly applying the quantum regression theorem (QRT), a useful procedure to calculate the two-time CF's for weak-coupling Markovian open systems. This demonstrates clearly that the recently derived evolution equations generalize correctly the QRT to non-Markovian finite-temperature cases. It is believed that these evolution equations will have applications in many different branches of physics.

We study the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of two qubits in a common squeezed bath. We see remarkable difference between the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics with its Markovian counterpart. We show that a non-Markovian decoherence free state is also decoherence free in the Markovian regime, but all the Markovian decoherence free states are not necessarily decoherence free in the non-Markovian domain. We extend our calculation from squeezed vacuum bath to squeezed thermal bath, where we see the effect of finite bath temperatures on the entanglement dynamics.

We obtained, for the two sets of measurements, interference net visibilities reaching nearly 100%, which represent important and competitive results compared to similar waveguide-based configurations already reported. These results prove the relevance of our approach as an enabling technology for long-distance quantum communication.

It is shown that the fidelity of the dynamically evolved system with its earlier time density matrix provides a signature of non-Markovian dynamics. Also, the fidelity associated with the initial state and the dynamically evolved state is shown to be larger in the non-Markovian evolution compared to that in the corresponding Markovian case. Starting from the Kraus representation of quantum evolution, the Markovian and non-Markovian features are discerned in its short time structure. These two features are in concordance with each other and they are illustrated with the help of four models of interaction of the system with its environment.

The proposed scheme not only provides a way to retrieve full information about potentially unknown dissipative coefficients but also, most valuably, can be employed as a reliable consistency test for the approximations involved in the theoretical derivation of a given non-Markovian convolutionless master equation.

<p>
An on-demand single-photon source is a fundamental building block in quantum science and technology. We experimentally demonstrate the proof of concept for a scheme to generate on-demand single photons via actively multiplexing several heralded photons probabilistically produced from pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversions (SPDCs). By utilizing a four-photon-pair source, an active feed-forward technique, and an ultrafast single-photon router, we show a fourfold enhancement of the output photon rate. Simultaneously, we maintain the quality of the output single-photon states, confirmed by correlation measurements. We also experimentally verify, via Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, that the router does not affect the indistinguishability of the single photons. Furthermore, we give numerical simulations, which indicate that photons based on multiplexing of four SPDC sources can outperform the heralding based on highly advanced photon-number-resolving detectors. Our results show a route for on-demand single-photon generation and the practical realization of scalable linear optical quantum information processing.

<blockquote>
<p>
We examine quantum statistics of optical photons emitted from atomic ensembles which are classically driven and simultaneously coupled to a two-level atom via microwave photon exchange. Quantum statistics and correlations are analyzed by calculating second order coherence degree, von Neumann entropy, spin squeezing for multi-particle entanglement, as well as genuine two and three-mode entanglement parameters for steady state and non-equilibrium situations. Coherent transfer of population between the radiation modes and quantum state mapping between the two-level atom and the optical modes are discussed. A potential experimental realization of the theoretical results in a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator containing diamond crystals with Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers and a superconducting artificial two-level atom is discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
Non-classical states of light, such as entangled photon pairs and number states, are essential for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and optical quantum technologies. The most widespread technique for creating these quantum resources is the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of laser light into photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations which are used to produce two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a longstanding goal of the quantum optics community to realise a source that can produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches considered, none have been technically feasible. In this paper we report the observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Here each triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum correlations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with independently created photon pairs. We expect our photon-triplet source to open up new avenues of quantum optics and become an important tool in quantum technologies. Our source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum correlations, the post-selection free generation of tripartite entanglement without post- selection and the generation of heralded entangled-photon pairs suitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, ideally suited for three-party quantum communication. Furthermore, our results open interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant to optical quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a technique to nanofabricate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond based on broad-beam nitrogen implantation through apertures in electron beam lithography resist. This method enables high-throughput nanofabrication of single NV centers on sub-100 nm length scales. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements facilitate depth profiling of the implanted nitrogen to provide three-dimensional characterization of the NV center spatial distribution. Measurements of NV center coherence with on-chip coplanar waveguides suggest a pathway for incorporating this scalable nanofabrication technique in future quantum applications.

**30.    Some Calculable Contributions to Entanglement Entropy**  
Mark P. Hertzberg, Frank Wilczek  
Phys.Rev.Lett.106:050404,2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0993  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement entropy appears as a central property of quantum systems in broad areas of physics. However, its precise value is often sensitive to unknown microphysics, rendering it incalculable. By considering parametric dependence on correlation length, we extract finite, calculable contributions to the entanglement entropy for a scalar field between the interior and exterior of a spatial domain of arbitrary shape. The leading term is proportional to the area of the dividing boundary; we also extract finite subleading contributions for a field defined in the bulk interior of a waveguide in 3+1 dimensions, including terms proportional to the waveguide's cross-sectional geometry; its area, perimeter length, and integrated curvature. We also consider related quantities at criticality and suggest a class of systems for which these contributions might be measurable.

**31.    Quantum Error Correction beyond the Bounded Distance Decoding Limit**  
Kenta Kasai, Manabu Hagiwara, Hideki Imai, Kohichi Sakaniwa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1778  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider quantum error correction over depolarizing channels with non-binary low-density parity-check codes defined over Galois field of size $2^p$ . The proposed quantum error correcting codes are based on the binary quasi-cyclic CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane) codes. The resulting quantum codes outperform the best known quantum codes and surpass the performance limit of the bounded distance decoder. By increasing the size of the underlying Galois field, i.e., $2^p$, the error floors are considerably improved.

Applied Physics Express 3, 093004 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2166  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum interference incorporating spatially asymmetric potential profiles is realized experimentally to manipulate a magnetic domain wall (DW) into a single multilayered wire whose spacer has a thickness gradient for generating asymmetrical interlayer exchange coupling from side to side. We demonstrate experimentally how to guide a DW in a micron-scale ferromagnetic wire without reflection symmetry of the interlayer exchange coupling. This is the ratcheting of a DW in a form of ratchet potential using quantum interference. The experimental results can be described well by numerical simulations considering spatially asymmetric potential profiles due to quantum interference.

**33.    Lifetime and Coherence of Two-Level Defects in a Josephson Junction**  
Yoni Shalibo, Ya'ara Rofe, David Shwa, Felix Zeides, Matthew Neeley, John Martinis, Nadav Katz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2577  
<blockquote>
<p>
We measure the lifetime ($T_{1}$) and coherence ($T_{2}$) of two-level defect states (TLSs) in the insulating barrier of a Josephson phase qubit and compare to the interaction strength between the two systems. We find for the average decay times a power law dependence on the corresponding interaction strengths, whereas for the average coherence times we find an optimum at intermediate coupling strengths. We explain both the lifetime and the coherence results using the standard TLS model, including dipole radiation by phonons and anti-correlated dependence of the energy parameters on environmental fluctuations.

T.P. Simula, K. Machida  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 063627 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3548  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have calculated the low-lying elementary excitations of three-dimensional few-vortex arrays in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. The number of different Kelvin-Tkachenko vortex wave branches matches the number of vortices in the condensate. The lowest odd-parity modes exhibit superfluid gyroscopic vortex motion. Experimentally, these modes could be excited and observed individually or in connection with the formation and decay of quantum turbulence.

<blockquote>
<p>
We have computed phase diagrams for rotating spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Spin textures including vortex sheets, staggered half-quantum- and skyrmion vortex lattices and higher order topological defects have been found. These systems exhibit both superfluidity and magnetic crystalline ordering and they could be realized experimentally by imparting angular momentum in the condensate.
