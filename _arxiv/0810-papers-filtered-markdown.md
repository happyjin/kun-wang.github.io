**1.    Multipartite entanglement purification with quantum nondemolition detectors**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Fu-Guo Deng, Bao-Kui Zhao, Tie-Jun Wang, Hong-Yu Zhou  
Eur. Phys. j. D 55, 235-242 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0071  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme for multipartite entanglement purification of quantum systems in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with quantum nondemolition detectors (QNDs). This scheme does not require the controlled-not gates which cannot be implemented perfectly with linear optical elements at present, but QNDs based on cross-Kerr nonlinearities. It works with two steps, i.e., the bit-flipping error correction and the phase-flipping error correction. These two steps can be iterated perfectly with parity checks and simple single-photon measurements. This scheme does not require the parties to possess sophisticated single photon detectors. These features maybe make this scheme more efficient and feasible than others in practical applications.

**2.    On the relationship between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walk**  
Andrew M. Childs  
Communications in Mathematical Physics 294, 581-603 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0312  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk is one of the main tools for quantum algorithms. Defined by analogy to classical random walk, a quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum process on a graph. Both random and quantum walks can be defined either in continuous or discrete time. But whereas a continuous-time random walk can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of discrete-time random walks, the two types of quantum walk appear fundamentally different, owing to the need for extra degrees of freedom in the discrete-time case. In this article, I describe a precise correspondence between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs. Using this correspondence, I show that continuous-time quantum walk can be obtained as an appropriate limit of discrete-time quantum walks. The correspondence also leads to a new technique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, giving efficient simulations even in cases where the Hamiltonian is not sparse. The complexity of the simulation is linear in the total evolution time, an improvement over simulations based on high-order approximations of the Lie product formula. As applications, I describe a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness and show how to optimally simulate continuous-time query algorithms of a certain form in the conventional quantum query model. Finally, I discuss limitations of the method for simulating Hamiltonians with negative matrix elements, and present two problems that motivate attempting to circumvent these limitations.

**4.    On the efficiency of nondegenerate quantum error correction codes for Pauli channels**  
Gunnar Bjork, Jonas Almlof, Isabel Sainz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0541  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the efficiency of pure, nondegenerate quantum-error correction-codes for Pauli channels. Specifically, we investigate if correction of multiple errors in a block is more efficient than using a code that only corrects one error per block. Block coding with multiple-error correction cannot increase the efficiency when the qubit error-probability is below a certain value and the code size fixed. More surprisingly, existing multiple-error correction codes with a code length equal or less than 256 qubits have lower efficiency than the optimal single-error correcting codes for any value of the qubit error-probability. We also investigate how efficient various proposed nondegenerate single-error correcting codes are compared to the limit set by the code redundancy and by the necessary conditions for hypothetically existing nondegenerate codes. We find that existing codes are close to optimal.

**5.    Dynamically Error-Corrected Gates for Universal Quantum Computation**  
Kaveh Khodjasteh, Lorenza Viola  
Phys.Rev.Lett.102:080501,2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0698  
<blockquote>
<p>
Scalable quantum computation in realistic devices requires that precise control can be implemented efficiently in the presence of decoherence and operational errors. We propose a general constructive procedure for designing robust unitary gates on an open quantum system without encoding or measurement overhead. Our results allow for a low-level error correction strategy solely based on Hamiltonian engineering using realistic bounded-strength controls and may substantially reduce implementation requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

**6.    Coherent transport on Apollonian networks and continuous-time quantum walks**  
Xinping Xu, Wei Li, Feng Liu  
Phys. Rev. E 78, 052103 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0824  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the coherent exciton transport on Apollonian networks generated by simple iterative rules. The coherent exciton dynamics is modeled by continuous-time quantum walks and we calculate the transition probabilities between two nodes of the networks. We find that the transport depends on the initial nodes of the excitation. For networks less than the second generation the coherent transport shows perfect revivals when the initial excitation starts at the central node. For networks of higher generation, the transport only shows partial revivals. Moreover, we find that the excitation is most likely to be found at the initial nodes while the coherent transport to other nodes has a very low probability. In the long time limit, the transition probabilities show characteristic patterns with identical values of limiting probabilities. Finally, the dynamics of quantum transport are compared with the classical transport modeled by continuous-time random walks.

**7.    Quantum amplitude amplification algorithm: an explanation of availability bias**  
Riccardo Franco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0959

<p>
In this article, I show that a recent family of quantum algorithms, based on the quantum amplitude amplification algorithm, can be used to describe a cognitive heuristic called availability bias. The amplitude amplification algorithm is used to define quantitatively the ease of a memory task, while the quantum amplitude estimation and the quantum counting algorithms to describe cognitive tasks such as estimating probability or approximate counting.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the spectral properties of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion in a periodically poled waveguided structure of KTP crystal pumped by ultra-short pulses. Our theoretical analysis reveals a strongly multimode and asymmetric structure of the two-photon spectral amplitude for type-II SPDC. Experimental evidence, based on Hong-Ou-Mandel polarization interference with narrowband filtering, confirms this result.

**9.    Monogamy of Bell's inequality violations in non-signaling theories**  
Marcin Pawlowski, Caslav Brukner  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 030403 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1175  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive monogamy relations (tradeoffs) between strengths of violations of Bell's inequalities from the non-signaling condition. Our result applies to general Bell inequalities with an arbitrary large number of partners, outcomes and measurement settings. The method is simple, efficient and does not require linear programming. The results are used to derive optimal fidelity for asymmetric cloning in nonsignaling theories.

**10.    Dynamics of continuous-time quantum walks in restricted geometries**  
E. Agliari, A. Blumen, O. Muelken  
J. Phys. A 41, 445301 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1184  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum transport on finite discrete structures and we model the process by means of continuous-time quantum walks. A direct and effective comparison between quantum and classical walks can be attained based on the average displacement of the walker as a function of time. Indeed, a fast growth of the average displacement can be advantageously exploited to build up efficient search algorithms. By means of analytical and numerical investigations, we show that the finiteness and the inhomogeneity of the substrate jointly weaken the quantum walk performance. We further highlight the interplay between the quantum-walk dynamics and the underlying topology by studying the temporal evolution of the transfer probability distribution and the lower bound of long time averages.

**11.    Pseudomodes as an effective description of memory: Non-Markovian dynamics of two-state systems in structured reservoirs**

Phys. Rev. A 80, 012104 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1361  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of two-state systems in structured reservoirs. We establish a connection between two theoretical quantum approaches, the pseudomodes [B. M. Garraway, Phys. Rev. A 55, 2290 (1997)] and the recently developed non-Markovian quantum jump method [J. Piilo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 180402 (2008)]. This connection provides a clear physical picture of how the structured reservoir affects the system dynamics, indicating the role of the pseudomodes as an effective description of the environmental memory.

**12.    Generic quantum walk using a coin-embedded shift operator**  
C.M. Chandrashekar  
Phys. Rev. A, 78, 052309 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1556  
<blockquote>
<p>
The study of quantum walk processes has been widely divided into two standard variants, the discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) and the continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW). The connection between the two variants has been established by considering the limiting value of the coin operation parameter in the DTQW, and the coin degree of freedom was shown to be unnecessary [26]. But the coin degree of freedom is an additional resource which can be exploited to control the dynamics of the QW process. In this paper we present a generic quantum walk model using a quantum coin-embedded unitary shift operation $U_{C}$. The standard version of the DTQW and the CTQW can be conveniently retrieved from this generic model, retaining the features of the coin degree of freedom in both variants.

**13.    Unbiased bases (Hadamards) for 6-level systems: Four ways from Fourier**  
A. J. Skinner, V. A. Newell, R. Sanchez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1761  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum mechanics some properties are maximally incompatible, such as the position and momentum of a particle or the vertical and horizontal projections of a 2-level spin. Given any definite state of one property the other property is completely random, or unbiased. For N-level systems, the 6-level ones are the smallest for which a tomographically efficient set of N+1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) has not been found. To facilitate the search, we numerically extend the classification of unbiased bases, or Hadamards, by incrementally adjusting relative phases in a standard basis. We consider the non-unitarity caused by small adjustments with a second order Taylor expansion, and choose incremental steps within the 4-dimensional nullspace of the curvature. In this way we prescribe a numerical integration of a 4-parameter set of Hadamards of order 6.

<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a means of simulating the evolution and measurement of a multipartite quantum state under discrete or continuous evolution using another quantum system with states and operators lying in a real Hilbert space. This extends previous results which were unable to simulate local evolution and measurements with local operators and was limited to discrete evolution. We also detail applications to Bell inequalities and self-testing of quantum apparatus.

**15.    Modified entanglement purification scheme with doubly entangled photon state**  
Chuan Wang, Yu-Bo Sheng, Xi-Han Li, Fu-Guo Deng, Wei Zhang, Gui Lu Long  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2011  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently Xiao et al. proposed a scheme for entanglement purification based on doubly entangled photon states (Phys. Rev. A 77(2008) 042315). We modify their scheme for improving the efficiency of entanglement purification. This modified scheme contains two steps, i.e., the bit-flip error correction and the entanglement purification of phase-flip errors. All the photon pairs in the first step can be kept as all the bit-flip errors are corrected. For purifying the phase-flip errors, a wavelength conversion process is needed. This scheme has the advantage of high efficiency and it requires the original fidelity of the entangled state wanted fay lower than other schemes, which makes it more feasible in a practical application.

**16.    Non-Markovian Quantum Jump with Generalized Lindblad Master Equation**  
X.L. Huang, H.Y. Sun, X.X. Yi  
PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78, 041107(2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2337  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Monte Carlo wave function method or the quantum trajectory/jump approach is a powerful tool to study dissipative dynamics governed by the Markovian master equation, in particular for high-dimensional systems and when it is difficult to simulate directly. In this paper, we extend this method to the non-Markovian case described by the generalized Lindblad master equation. Two examples to illustrate the method are presented and discussed. The results show that the method can correctly reproduce the dissipative dynamics for the system. The difference between this method and the traditional Markovian jump approach and the computational efficiency of this method are also discussed.

**17.    Channel-Optimized Quantum Error Correction**  
Soraya Taghavi, Robert L. Kosut, Daniel A. Lidar  
IEEE Trans. on Info. Theory 56, 1461 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2524  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a theory for finding quantum error correction (QEC) procedures which are optimized for given noise channels. Our theory accounts for uncertainties in the noise channel, against which our QEC procedures are robust. We demonstrate via numerical examples that our optimized QEC procedures always achieve a higher channel fidelity than the standard error correction method, which is agnostic about the specifics of the channel. This demonstrates the importance of channel characterization before QEC procedures are applied. Our main novel finding is that in the setting of a known noise channel the recovery ancillas are redundant for optimized quantum error correction. We show this using a general rank minimization heuristic and supporting numerical calculations. Therefore, one can further improve the fidelity by utilizing all the available ancillas in the encoding block.

**18.    Quantum stabilizer codes and beyond**  
Pradeep Kiran Sarvepalli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2574  
<blockquote>
<p>
The importance of quantum error correction in paving the way to build a practical quantum computer is no longer in doubt. This dissertation makes a threefold contribution to the mathematical theory of quantum error-correcting codes. Firstly, it extends the framework of an important class of quantum codes -- nonbinary stabilizer codes. It clarifies the connections of stabilizer codes to classical codes over quadratic extension fields, provides many new constructions of quantum codes, and develops further the theory of optimal quantum codes and punctured quantum codes. Secondly, it contributes to the theory of operator quantum error correcting codes also called as subsystem codes. These codes are expected to have efficient error recovery schemes than stabilizer codes. This dissertation develops a framework for study and analysis of subsystem codes using character theoretic methods. In particular, this work establishes a close link between subsystem codes and classical codes showing that the subsystem codes can be constructed from arbitrary classical codes. Thirdly, it seeks to exploit the knowledge of noise to design efficient quantum codes and considers more realistic channels than the commonly studied depolarizing channel. It gives systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit the asymmetry of errors in certain quantum channels.

**19.    A photonic cluster state machine gun**  
Netanel H. Lindner, Terry Rudolph  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 113602 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2587  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method to convert certain single photon sources into devices capable of emitting large strings of photonic cluster state in a controlled and pulsed "on demand" manner. Such sources would greatly reduce the resources required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors, such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a time. This allows for the use of standard fault tolerance techniques, and shows that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per photon of less than 0.2%. For quantum dot sources the method has the added advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.

**20.    Universal quantum computation in a hidden basis**  
Lawrence M. Ioannou, Michele Mosca  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 10, No. 7&8, 0541-0561 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2780  
<blockquote>
<p>
Let $\ket{\0}$ and $\ket{\1}$ be two states that are promised to come from known subsets of orthogonal subspaces, but are otherwise unknown. Our paper probes the question of what can be achieved with respect to the basis $\{\ket{\0},\ket{\1}}^{\otimes n}$ of $n$ logical qubits, given only a few copies of the unknown states $\ket{\0}$ and $\ket{\1}$. A phase-invariant operator is one that is unchanged under the relative phase-shift $\ket{\1} \mapsto e^{i \theta}\ket{\1}$, for any $\theta$, of all of the $n$ qubits. We show that phase-invariant unitary operators can be implemented exactly with no copies and that phase-invariant states can be prepared exactly with at most $n$ copies each of $\ket{\0}$ and $\ket{\1}$; we give an explicit algorithm for state preparation that is efficient for some classes of states (e.g. symmetric states). We conjecture that certain non-phase-invariant operations are impossible to perform accurately without many copies. Motivated by optical implementations of quantum computers, we define ``quantum computation in a hidden basis'' to mean executing a quantum algorithm with respect to the phase-shifted hidden basis $\{\ket{\0}, e^{i\theta}\ket{\1}\}$, for some potentially unknown $\theta$; we give an efficient approximation algorithm for this task, for which we introduce an analogue of a coherent state of light, which serves as a bounded quantum phase reference frame encoding $\theta$. Our motivation was quantum-public-key cryptography, however the techniques are general. We apply our results to quantum-public-key authentication protocols, by showing that a natural class of digital signature schemes for classical messages is insecure. We also give a protocol for identification that uses many of the ideas discussed and whose security relates to our conjecture (but we do not know if it is secure).

**21.    Quantum Random Access Codes with Shared Randomness**  
Andris Ambainis, Debbie Leung, Laura Mancinska, Maris Ozols  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2937  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a communication method, where the sender encodes n classical bits into 1 qubit and sends it to the receiver who performs a certain measurement depending on which of the initial bits must be recovered. This procedure is called (n,1,p) quantum random access code (QRAC) where p > 1/2 is its success probability. It is known that (2,1,0.85) and (3,1,0.79) QRACs (with no classical counterparts) exist and that (4,1,p) QRAC with p > 1/2 is not possible. We extend this model with shared randomness (SR) that is accessible to both parties. Then (n,1,p) QRAC with SR and p > 1/2 exists for any n > 0. We give an upper bound on its success probability (the known (2,1,0.85) and (3,1,0.79) QRACs match this upper bound). We discuss some particular constructions for several small values of n. We also study the classical counterpart of this model where n bits are encoded into 1 bit instead of 1 qubit and SR is used. We give an optimal construction for such codes and find their success probability exactly--it is less than in the quantum case. Interactive 3D quantum random access codes are available on-line at this http URL .

<p>
One of the most important quantum algorithms ever discovered is Grover's algorithm for searching an unordered set. We give a new lower bound in the query model which proves that Grover's algorithm is exactly optimal. Similar to existing methods for proving lower bounds, we bound the amount of information we can gain from a single oracle query, but we bound this information in terms of angles. This allows our proof to be simple, self-contained, based on only elementary mathematics, capturing our intuition, while obtaining at the same an exact bound.

<blockquote>
<p>
An algorithm is presented for approximating arbitrary powers of a black box unitary operation, $\mathcal{U}^t$, where $t$ is a real number, and $\mathcal{U}$ is a black box implementing an unknown unitary. The complexity of this algorithm is calculated in terms of the number of calls to the black box, the errors in the approximation, and a certain `gap' parameter. For general $\mathcal{U}$ and large $t$, one should apply $\mathcal{U}$ a total of $\lfloor t \rfloor$ times followed by our procedure for approximating the fractional power $\mathcal{U}^{t-\lfloor t \rfloor}$. An example is also given where for large integers $t$ this method is more efficient than direct application of $t$ copies of $\mathcal{U}$. Further applications and related algorithms are also discussed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4005  
<blockquote>
<p>
The frequency distinguishability of two single photons was successfully erased using single photon frequency up-conversion. A frequency non-degenerate photon pair generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a dispersion shifted fiber was used to emulate two telecom-band single photons that were in the same temporal mode but in different frequency modes. The frequencies of these photons were converted to the same frequency by using the sum frequency generation process in periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, while maintaining their temporal indistinguishability. As a result, the two converted photons exhibited a non-classical dip in a Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference experiment. The present scheme will add flexibility to networking quantum information systems that use photons with various wavelengths.
