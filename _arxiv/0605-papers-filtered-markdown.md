**1.    A Bell Inequality Analog in Quantum Measure Theory**  
David Craig, Fay Dowker, Joe Henson, Seth Major, David Rideout, Rafael D. Sorkin  
J.Phys.A40:501-523,2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605008  
<blockquote>
<p>
One obtains Bell's inequalities if one posits a hypothetical joint probability distribution, or {\it measure}, whose marginals yield the probabilities produced by the spin measurements in question. The existence of a joint measure is in turn equivalent to a certain causality condition known as ``screening off''. We show that if one assumes, more generally, a joint {\it quantal measure}, or ``decoherence functional'', one obtains instead an analogous inequality weaker by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The proof of this ``Tsirel'son inequality'' is geometrical and rests on the possibility of associating a Hilbert space to any strongly positive quantal measure. These results lead both to a {\it question}: ``Does a joint measure follow from some quantal analog of `screening off'?'', and to the {\it observation} that non-contextual hidden variables are viable in histories-based quantum mechanics, even if they are excluded classically.

**2.    Potential and limits to cluster state quantum computing using probabilistic gates**  
D. Gross, K. Kieling, J. Eisert  
Phys. Rev. A 74, 042343 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605014  
<blockquote>
<p>
We establish bounds to the necessary resource consumption when building up cluster states for one-way computing using probabilistic gates. Emphasis is put on state preparation with linear optical gates, as the probabilistic character is unavoidable here. We identify rigorous general bounds to the necessary consumption of initially available maximally entangled pairs when building up one-dimensional cluster states with individually acting linear optical quantum gates, entangled pairs and vacuum modes. As the known linear optics gates have a limited maximum success probability, as we show, this amounts to finding the optimal classical strategy of fusing pieces of linear cluster states. A formal notion of classical configurations and strategies is introduced for probabilistic non-faulty gates. We study the asymptotic performance of strategies that can be simply described, and prove ultimate bounds to the performance of the globally optimal strategy. The arguments employ methods of random walks and convex optimization. This optimal strategy is also the one that requires the shortest storage time, and necessitates the fewest invocations of probabilistic gates. For two-dimensional cluster states, we find, for any elementary success probability, an essentially deterministic preparation of a cluster state with quadratic, hence optimal, asymptotic scaling in the use of entangled pairs. We also identify a percolation effect in state preparation, in that from a threshold probability on, almost all preparations will be either successful or fail. We outline the implications on linear optical architectures and fault-tolerant computations.

**3.    Efficiency limits for linear optical processing of single photons and single-rail qubits**  
Dominic W. Berry, A. I. Lvovsky, Barry C. Sanders  
Journal of the Optical Society of America B 24, 189 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605043  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the problem of increasing the efficiency of single-photon sources or single-rail photonic qubits via linear optical processing and destructive conditional measurements. In contrast to previous work we allow for the use of coherent states and do not limit to photon-counting measurements. We conjecture that it is not possible to increase the efficiency, prove this conjecture for several important special cases, and provide extensive numerical results for the general case.

**4.    Decoherence by engineered quantum baths**  
Davide Rossini, Tommaso Calarco, Vittorio Giovannetti, Simone Montangero, Rosario Fazio  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40 (2007) 8033-8040  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605051  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce, and determine decoherence for, a wide class of non-trivial quantum spin baths which embrace Ising, XY and Heisenberg universality classes coupled to a two-level system. For the XY and Ising universality classes we provide an exact expression for the decay of the loss of coherence beyond the case of a central spin coupled uniformly to all the spins of the baths which has been discussed so far in the literature. In the case of the Heisenberg spin bath we study the decoherence by means of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We show how these baths can be engineered, by using atoms in optical lattices.

**6.    Homological Error Correction: Classical and Quantum Codes**  
H. Bombin, M.A. Martin-Delgado  
J.Math.Phys.48:052105,2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605094  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove several theorems characterizing the existence of homological error correction codes both classically and quantumly. Not every classical code is homological, but we find a family of classical homological codes saturating the Hamming bound. In the quantum case, we show that for non-orientable surfaces it is impossible to construct homological codes based on qudits of dimension $D>2$, while for orientable surfaces with boundaries it is possible to construct them for arbitrary dimension $D$. We give a method to obtain planar homological codes based on the construction of quantum codes on compact surfaces without boundaries. We show how the original Shor's 9-qubit code can be visualized as a homological quantum code. We study the problem of constructing quantum codes with optimal encoding rate. In the particular case of toric codes we construct an optimal family and give an explicit proof of its optimality. For homological quantum codes on surfaces of arbitrary genus we also construct a family of codes asymptotically attaining the maximum possible encoding rate. We provide the tools of homology group theory for graphs embedded on surfaces in a self-contained manner.

**7.    An interpretation of quantum mechanics based on a waveguide analogy**  
Roald Ekholdt  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605116  
<blockquote>
<p>
Based on an observation that the basic mode of a common microwave waveguide is a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation, quantum mechanics is modeled as the wave-function propagated inside a waveguide. The guide width is determined by the rest-energy and the potential energy. Moreover, a geometrical optics model of the propagation illustrates how the width as a function of distance determines the velocity and accelerations of the particle. The model entails the disappearance of action-at-a-distance problem, and that interactions are conveyed via the potential, i.e. by photons.

**8.    On the Relationship between Convex Bodies Related to Correlation Experiments with Dichotomic Observables**  
David Avis, Hiroshi Imai, Tsuyoshi Ito  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605148  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we explore further the connections between convex bodies related to quantum correlation experiments with dichotomic variables and related bodies studied in combinatorial optimization, especially cut polyhedra. Such a relationship was established in Avis, Imai, Ito and Sasaki (2005 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 10971-87) with respect to Bell inequalities. We show that several well known bodies related to cut polyhedra are equivalent to bodies such as those defined by Tsirelson (1993 Hadronic J. S. 8 329-45) to represent hidden deterministic behaviors, quantum behaviors, and no-signalling behaviors. Among other things, our results allow a unique representation of these bodies, give a necessary condition for vertices of the no-signalling polytope, and give a method for bounding the quantum violation of Bell inequalities by means of a body that contains the set of quantum behaviors. Optimization over this latter body may be performed efficiently by semidefinite programming. In the second part of the paper we apply these results to the study of classical correlation functions. We provide a complete list of tight inequalities for the two party case with (m,n) dichotomic observables when m=4,n=4 and when min{m,n}<=3, and give a new general family of correlation inequalities.

**9.    Quantum Information Processing in Optical Lattices and Magnetic Microtraps**  
Philipp Treutlein, Tilo Steinmetz, Yves Colombe, Benjamin Lev, Peter Hommelhoff, Jakob Reichel, Markus Greiner, Olaf Mandel, Arthur Widera, Tim Rom, Immanuel Bloch, Theodor W. H?nsch  
Fortschr. Phys. 54, 702-718 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605163  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review our experiments on quantum information processing with neutral atoms in optical lattices and magnetic microtraps. Atoms in an optical lattice in the Mott insulator regime serve as a large qubit register. A spin-dependent lattice is used to split and delocalize the atomic wave functions in a controlled and coherent way over a defined number of lattice sites. This is used to experimentally demonstrate a massively parallel quantum gate array, which allows the creation of a highly entangled many-body cluster state through coherent collisions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites. In magnetic microtraps on an atom chip, we demonstrate coherent manipulation of atomic qubit states and measure coherence lifetimes exceeding one second at micron-distance from the chip surface. We show that microwave near-fields on the chip can be used to create state-dependent potentials for the implementation of a quantum controlled phase gate with these robust qubit states. For single atom detection and preparation, we have developed high finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities and integrated them on the atom chip. We present an experiment in which we detected a very small number of cold atoms magnetically trapped in the cavity using the atom chip.

**10.    A microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap in silicon**

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605170  
<blockquote>
<p>
The prospect of building a quantum information processor underlies many recent advances ion trap fabrication techniques. Potentially, a quantum computer could be constructed from a large array of interconnected ion traps. We report on a micrometer-scale ion trap, fabricated from bulk silicon using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) techniques. The trap geometry is relatively simple in that the electrodes lie in a single plane beneath the ions. In such a trap we confine laser-cooled 24Mg+ ions approximately 40 microns above the surface. The fabrication technique and planar electrode geometry together make this approach amenable to scaling up to large trap arrays. In addition we observe that little laser cooling light is scattered by the electrodes.

**11.    Lensless Fourier-Transform Ghost Imaging with Classical Incoherent Light**  
Minghui Zhang, Qing Wei, Xia Shen, Yongfeng Liu, Honglin Liu, Jing Cheng, Shensheng Han  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605188  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Fourier-Transform ghost imaging of both amplitude-only and pure-phase objects was experimentally observed with classical incoherent light at Fresnel distance by a new lensless scheme. The experimental results are in good agreement with the standard Fourier-transform of the corresponding objects. This scheme provides a new route towards aberration-free diffraction-limited 3D images with classically incoherent thermal light, which have no resolution and depth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems.

**12.    Time and frequency domain solutions in an optical analogue of Grover's search algorithm**  
T.W. Hijmans, T.N. Huussen, R.J.C. Spreeuw  
J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 24, 214 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605194  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present new results on an optical implementation of Grover's quantum search algorithm. This extends previous work in which the transverse spatial mode of a light beam oscillates between a broad initial input shape and a highly localized spike, which reveals the position of the tagged item. The spike reaches its maximum intensity after $\sim\sqrt N$ round trips in a cavity equipped with two phase plates, where $N$ is the ratio of the surface area of the original beam and the area of the phase spot or tagged item. In our redesigned experiment the search space is now two-dimensional. In the time domain we demonstrate for the first time a multiple item search where the items appear directly as bright spots on the images of a gated camera. In a complementary experiment we investigate the searching cavity in the frequency domain. The oscillatory nature of the search algorithm can be seen as a splitting of cavity eigenmodes, each of which concentrates up to 50% of its power in the bright spot corresponding to the solution.

**13.    Free Dirac evolution as a quantum random walk**  
A.J. Bracken, D. Ellinas, I. Smyrnakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605195  
<blockquote>
<p>
Any positive-energy state of a free Dirac particle that is initially highly-localized, evolves in time by spreading at speeds close to the speed of light. This general phenomenon is explained by the fact that the Dirac evolution can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a quantum random walk, where the roles of coin and walker systems are naturally attributed to the spin and position degrees of freedom of the particle. Initially entangled and spatially localized spin-position states evolve with asymptotic two-horned distributions of the position probability, familiar from earlier studies of quantum walks. For the Dirac particle, the two horns travel apart at close to the speed of light.

**14.    Classification of GHZ-type, W-type and GHZ-W-type multiqubit entanglements**  
Lin Chen, Yi-Xin Chen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605196  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose the concept of SLOCC-equivalent basis (SEB) in the multiqubit space. In particular, two special SEBs, the GHZ-type and the W-type basis are introduced. They can make up a more general family of multiqubit states, the GHZ-W-type states, which is a useful kind of entanglement for quantum teleporatation and error correction. We completely characterize the property of this type of states, and mainly classify the GHZ-type states and the W-type states in a regular way, which is related to the enumerative combinatorics. Many concrete examples are given to exhibit how our method is used for the classification of these entangled states.

**15.    Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem on Distinguishability**  
Takayuki Miyadera, Hideki Imai  
Phys.Rev.A 74, 024101 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605213  
<blockquote>
<p>
The presence of an additive conserved quantity imposes a limitation on the measurement process. According to the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, the perfect repeatability and the distinguishability on the apparatus cannot be attained simultaneously. Instead of the repeatability, in this paper, the distinguishability on both systems is examined. We derive a trade-off inequality between the distinguishability of the final states on the system and the one on the apparatus. The inequality shows that the perfect distinguishability of both systems cannot be attained simultaneously.

**16.    Quantum loop programs**  
Mingsheng Ying, Yuan Feng  
Acta Informatica 47(4): 221-250 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605218  
<blockquote>
<p>
Loop is a powerful program construct in classical computation, but its power is still not exploited fully in quantum computation. The exploitation of such power definitely requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of quantum loop programs. In this paper, we introduce a general scheme of quantum loops and describe its computational process. The notions of termination and almost termination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a quantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are applied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for termination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input state are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it (almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost terminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating. It is observed that a small disturbance either on the unitary transformation in the loop body or on the measurement in the loop guard can make any quantum loop (almost) terminating. Moreover, a representation of the function computed by a quantum loop is given in terms of finite summations of matrices. To illustrate the notions and results obtained in this paper, two simplest classes of quantum loop programs, one qubit quantum loops, and two qubit quantum loops defined by controlled gates, are carefully examined.

**17.    Quantum Error Correction of Time-Correlated Errors**  
Feng Lu, Dan C. Marinescu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605226  
<blockquote>
<p>
The complexity of the error correction circuitry forces us to design quantum error correction codes capable of correcting a single error per error correction cycle. Yet, time-correlated error are common for physical implementations of quantum systems; an error corrected during the previous cycle may reoccur later due to physical processes specific for each physical implementation of the qubits. In this paper we study quantum error correction for a restricted class of time-correlated errors in a spin-boson model. The algorithm we propose allows the correction of two errors per error correction cycle, provided that one of them is time-correlated. The algorithm can be applied to any stabilizer code when the two logical qubits $\mid 0_L>$ and $\mid 1_L>$ are entangled states of $2^{n}$ basis states in $\mathcal{H}_{2^n}$.

**18.    Integration of fiber coupled high-Q silicon nitride microdisks with atom chips**  
Paul E. Barclay, Benjamin Lev, Kartik Srinivasan, Oskar Painter, Hideo Mabuchi  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 131108 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605234  
<blockquote>
<p>
Micron scale silicon nitride (SiN_x) microdisk optical resonators are demonstrated with Q = 3.6 x 10^6 and an effective mode volume of 15 (\lambda / n)^3 at near visible wavelengths. A hydrofluoric acid wet etch provides sensitive tuning of the microdisk resonances, and robust mounting of a fiber taper provides efficient fiber optic coupling to the microdisks while allowing unfettered optical access for laser cooling and trapping of atoms. Measurements indicate that cesium adsorption on the SiN_x surfaces significantly red-detunes the microdisk resonances. A technique for parallel integration of multiple (10) microdisks with a single fiber taper is also demonstrated.

Two results are proved at the quantal level in Sorkin's hierarchy of measure theories. One is a strengthening of an existing bound on the correlations in the EPR-Bohm setup under the assumption that the probabilities admit a strongly positive joint quantal measure. It is also proved that any set of no-signalling probabilities, for two distant experimenters with a choice of two alternative experiments each and two possible outcomes per experiment, admits a joint quantal measure, though one that is not necessarily strongly positive.
