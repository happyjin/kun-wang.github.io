**1.    Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems**  
Andrew M. Childs, Wim van Dam  
Reviews of Modern Physics 82, 1-52 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0380  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers can execute algorithms that dramatically outperform classical computation. As the best-known example, Shor discovered an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers, whereas factoring appears to be difficult for classical computers. Understanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly faster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of quantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of building a large-scale quantum computer. This article reviews the current state of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms with superpolynomial speedup over classical computation, and in particular, on problems with an algebraic flavor.

**2.    Experimental entanglement distillation of mesoscopic quantum states**  
Ruifang Dong, Mikael Lassen, Joel Heersink, Christoph Marquardt, Radim Filip, Gerd Leuchs, Ulrik L. Andersen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0709  
<blockquote>
<p>
The distribution of entangled states between distant parties in an optical network is crucial for the successful implementation of various quantum communication protocols such as quantum cryptography, teleportation and dense coding [1-3]. However, owing to the unavoidable loss in any real optical channel, the distribution of loss-intolerant entangled states is inevitably inflicted by decoherence, which causes a degradation of the transmitted entanglement. To combat the decoherence, entanglement distillation, which is the process of extracting a small set of highly entangled states from a large set of less entangled states, can be used [4-14]. Here we report on the mesoscopic distillation of deterministically prepared entangled light pulses that have undergone non-Gaussian noise. The entangled light pulses [15-17] are sent through a lossy channel, where the transmission is varying in time similarly to light propagation in the atmosphere. By employing linear optical components and global classical communication, the entanglement is probabilistically increased.

**3.    Experimental Determination of the Gain Distribution of an Avalanche Photodiode at Low Gains**  
Kenji Tsujino, Makoto Akiba, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0842  
<blockquote>
<p>
A measurement system for determining the gain distributions of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) in a low gain range is presented. The system is based on an ultralow-noise charge--sensitive amplifier and detects the output carriers from an APD. The noise of the charge--sensitive amplifier is as low as 4.2 electrons at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. The gain distribution of a commercial Si APD with low average gains are presented, demonstrating the McIntyre theory in the low gain range.

**4.    Generation of Total Angular Momentum Eigenstates in Remote Qubits**  
A. Maser, U. Schilling, T. Bastin, E. Solano, C. Thiel, J. von Zanthier  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 033833 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0959  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme enabling the universal coupling of angular momentum of $N$ remote noninteracting qubits using linear optical tools only. Our system consists of $N$ single-photon emitters in a $\Lambda$-configuration that are entangled among their long-lived ground-state qubits through suitably designed measurements of the emitted photons. In this manner, we present an experimentally feasible algorithm that is able to generate any of the $2^N$ symmetric and nonsymmetric total angular momentum eigenstates spanning the Hilbert space of the $N$-qubit compound.

**5.    Survival Probability of a Local Excitation in a Non-Markovian Environment: Survival Collapse, Zeno and Anti-Zeno effects**  
E. Rufeil Fiori, H. M. Pastawski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1009  
<blockquote>
<p>
The decay dynamics of a local excitation interacting with a non-Markovian environment, modeled by a semi-infinite tight-binding chain, is exactly evaluated. We identify distinctive regimes for the dynamics. Sequentially: (i) early quadratic decay of the initial-state survival probability, up to a spreading time $t_{S}$, (ii) exponential decay described by a self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule, and (iii) asymptotic behavior governed by quantum diffusion through the return processes and leading to an inverse power law decay. At this last cross-over time $t_{R}$ a survival collapse becomes possible. This could reduce the survival probability by several orders of magnitude. The cross-overs times $t_{S}$ and $t_{R}$ allow to assess the range of applicability of the Fermi Golden Rule and give the conditions for the observation of the Zeno and Anti-Zeno effect.

**6.    Non-Markovian weak coupling limit of quantum Brownian motion**  
Sabrina Maniscalco, Jyrki Piilo, Kalle-Antti Suominen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1096  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive and solve analytically the non-Markovian master equation for harmonic quantum Brownian motion proving that, for weak system-reservoir couplings and high temperatures, it can be recast in the form of the master equation for a harmonic oscillator interacting with a squeezed thermal bath. This equivalence guarantees preservation of positivity of the density operator during the time evolution and allows one to establish a connection between the dynamics of Schr\"odinger cat states in squeezed environments and environment-induced decoherence in quantum Brownian motion.

**7.    Physical model of continuous two-qubit parity measurement in a cavity-QED network**  
Joseph Kerckhoff, Luc Bouten, Andrew Silberfarb, Hideo Mabuchi  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 024305 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1246  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze a physical implementation of two-qubit parity measurements as required for continuous error correction, assuming a setup in which the individual qubits are strongly coupled to separate optical cavities. A single optical probe beam scatters sequentially from the two cavities and the continuous parity measurement is realized via fixed quadrature homodyne photo-detection. We present models based on quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDE's) for both an ideal continuous parity measurement and our proposed cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) implementation; a recent adiabatic elimination theorem for QSDE's is used to assert strong convergence of the latter to the former in an appropriate limit of physical parameters. Performance of the cavity QED scheme is studied via numerical simulation with experimentally realistic parameters.

**8.    Experimental realization of programmable quantum gate**  
Michal Micuda, Miroslav Jezek, Miloslav Dusek, Jaromir Fiurasek  
Phys. Rev. A 78, 062311 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1457  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate a programmable single-qubit quantum gate. This device applies a unitary phase shift operation to a data qubit with the value of the phase shift being fully determined by the state of a program qubit. Our linear optical implementation is based on the encoding of qubits into polarization states of single photons, two-photon interference on a polarizing beam splitter, and measurement on the output program qubit. We fully characterize the programmable gate by quantum process tomography. The achieved average quantum process fidelity exceeding 97% illustrates very good performance of the gate for all values of the encoded phase shift. We also show that by using a different set of program states the device can operate as a programmable partial polarization filter.

**9.    Quantum Zeno switch for single-photon coherent transport**  
Lan Zhou, S. Yang, Yu-xi Liu, C. P. Sun, Franco Nori  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 062109 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2151  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using a dynamical quantum Zeno effect, we propose a general approach to control the coupling between a two-level system (TLS) and its surroundings, by modulating the energy level spacing of the TLS with a high frequency signal. We show that the TLS--surroundings interaction can be turned on or off when the ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of the modulating field is adjusted to be a zero of a Bessel function. The quantum Zeno effect of the TLS can also be observed by the vanishing of the photon reflection at these zeros. Based on these results, we propose a quantum switch to control the transport of a single photon in a 1D waveguide. Our analytical results agree well with numerical results using Floquet theory.

**10.    Coherent exciton transport and trapping on long-range interacting cycles**  
Xinping Xu  
Phys. Rev. E 79, 011117 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3452  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider coherent exciton transport modeled by continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on long-range interacting cycles (LRICs), which are constructed by connecting all the two nodes of distance $m$ in the cycle graph. LRIC has a symmetric structure and can be regarded as the extensions of the cycle graph (nearest-neighboring lattice). For small values of $m$, the classical and quantum return probabilities show power law behavior $p(t)\sim t^{-0.5}$ and $\pi(t)\sim t^{-1}$, respectively. However, for large values of $m$, the classical and quantum efficiency scales as $p(t)\sim t^{-1}$ and $\pi(t)\sim t^{-2}$. We give a theoretical explanation of this transition using the method of stationary phase approximation (SPA). In the long time limit, depending on the network size $N$ and parameter $m$, the limiting probability distributions of quantum transport show various patterns. When the network size $N$ is an even number, we find an asymmetric transition probability of quantum transport between the initial node and its opposite node. This asymmetry depends on the precise values of $N$ and $m$. Finally, we study the transport processes in the presence of traps and find that the survival probability decays faster on networks of large $m$.

**11.    Proposal for Direct, Local Measurement of Entanglement for Pure Bipartite Systems of Arbitrary Dimension**  
Sang Min Lee, Hai-Woong Lee  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3457  
<blockquote>
<p>
Based on the complementarity relation between entanglement of a composite system and the purity of a subsystem, we propose a simple method to measure the amount of entanglement. The method can be applied to a bipartite system in a pure state of any arbitrary dimension. It requires only single qudit rotations and straightforward probability measurements performed on one of the subsystems, and can thus be easily implemented experimentally using linear optical devices.

**12.    Markov triplets on CCR-algebras**  
Anna Jencova, Denes Petz, Jozsef Pitrik  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3724  
<blockquote>
<p>
The paper contains a detailed computation about the algebra of canonical commutation relation, the representation of the Weyl unitaries, the quasi-free states and their von Neumann entropy. The Markov triplet is defined by constant entropy increase. The Markov property of a quasi-free state is described by the representing block matrix. The proof is based on results on the statistical sufficiency in the quantum case. The relation to classical Gaussian Markov triplets is also described.

**13.    Embedding classical into quantum computation**  
Richard Jozsa  
LNCS 5393 Beth Festschrift, J Calmet, W. Geiselmann, J. Mueller-Quade (Eds.), pp43-49 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4511  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a simple formalism for generating classes of quantum circuits that are classically efficiently simulatable and show that the efficient simulation of Clifford circuits (Gottesman-Knill theorem) and of matchgate circuits (Valiant's theorem) appear as two special cases. Viewing these simulatable classes as subsets of the space of all quantum computations, we may consider minimal extensions that suffice to regain full quantum computational power, which provides an approach to exploring the efficacy of quantum over classical computation.

**14.    Tri-partite Entanglement Witnesses and Sudden Death**  
Yaakov S. Weinstein  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 012318 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4612  
<blockquote>
<p>
I explore entanglement dynamics in a three qubit system comparing the ability of entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite entanglement to the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD). Using a system subject to dephasing I invoke entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite GHZ and W-type entanglement and compare the evolution of their detection capabilites with the evolution of the negativity, bi-partite concurrence, and tri-partite negativity. Interestingly, I find a state in which there is no concurrence or tri-partite negativity but there is entanglement. Finally, I utilize a three qubit quantum error correction (QEC) code to address how ESD affects the abilities of quantum error correction.

**15.    Toric-boson model: Toward a topological quantum memory at finite temperature**  
Alioscia Hamma, Claudio Castelnovo, Claudio Chamon  
Phys. Rev. B 79, 245122 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4622  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the existence of stable topological quantum memory at finite temperature. At stake here is the fundamental question of whether it is, in principle, possible to store quantum information for macroscopic times without the intervention from the external world, that is, without error correction. We study the toric code in two dimensions with an additional bosonic field that couples to the defects, in the presence of a generic environment at finite temperature: the toric-boson model. Although the coupling constants for the bare model are not finite in the thermodynamic limit, the model has a finite spectrum. We show that in the topological phase, there is a finite temperature below which open strings are confined and therefore the lifetime of the memory can be made arbitrarily (polynomially) long in system size. The interaction with the bosonic field yields a long-range attractive force between the end points of open strings but leaves closed strings and topological order intact.

**16.    Topics in quantum information and the theory of open quantum systems**  
Ognyan Oreshkov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4682  
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis examines seven topics in the areas of deterministic open-quantum-system dynamics, quantum measurements, and quantum error correction (QEC). The first topic concerns weak measurements and their universality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that every generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak (infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result to the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions for entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement monotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance of different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics. The system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction. The fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian noise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian dynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement for a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The fifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under continuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and the system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the robustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure of fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that operator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for restriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns holonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes. A fault-tolerant scheme for HQC is presented, proving the scalability of the holonomic approach.
