**1.    Quantum error correction fails for Hamiltonian models**  
Robert Alicki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411008  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is argued that the existing schemes of fault-tolerant quantum computation designed for discrete-time models and based on quantum error correction fail for continuous-time Hamiltonian models even with Markovian noise.

**2.    State preparation based on Grover's algorithm in the presence of global information about the state**  
Andrei N. Soklakov, Ruediger Schack  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411010  
<blockquote>
<p>
In a previous paper [quant-ph/0408045] we described a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary state of a quantum register with arbitrary fidelity. Here we present an alternative algorithm which uses a small number of quantum oracles encoding the most significant bits of the absolute value of the complex amplitudes, and a small number of oracles encoding the most significant bits of the phases. The algorithm given here is considerably simpler than the one described in [quant-ph/0408045], on the assumption that a sufficient amount of knowledge about the distribution of the absolute values of the complex amplitudes is available.

**3.    Scaling of non-Markovian Monte Carlo wave-function methods**  
J. Piilo, S. Maniscalco, A. Messina, F. Petruccione  
Phys. Rev. E 71, 056701 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411057  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a scaling method for non-Markovian Monte Carlo wave-function simulations used to study open quantum systems weakly coupled to their environments. We derive a scaling equation, from which the result for the expectation values of arbitrary operators of interest can be calculated, all the quantities in the equation being easily obtainable from the scaled Monte Carlo simulations. In the optimal case, the scaling method can be used, within the weak coupling approximation, to reduce the size of the generated Monte Carlo ensemble by several orders of magnitude. Thus, the developed method allows faster simulations and makes it possible to solve the dynamics of the certain class of non-Markovian systems whose simulation would be otherwise too tedious because of the requirement for large computational resources.

**4.    Quantum Walk on a Line with Two Entangled Particles**  
Y. Omar, N. Paunkovic, L. Sheridan, S. Bose  
Phys. Rev. A 74, 042304 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411065  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concept of a quantum walk with two particles and study it for the case of a discrete time walk on a line. A quantum walk with more than one particle may contain entanglement, thus offering a resource unavailable in the classical scenario and which can present interesting advantages. In this work, we show how the entanglement and the relative phase between the states describing the coin degree of freedom of each particle will influence the evolution of the quantum walk. In particular, the probability to find at least one particle in a certain position after $N$ steps of the walk, as well as the average distance between the two particles, can be larger or smaller than the case of two unentangled particles, depending on the initial conditions we choose. This resource can then be tuned according to our needs, in particular to enhance a given application (algorithmic or other) based on a quantum walk. Experimental implementations are briefly discussed.

**5.    A presentation of the quantum Fourier transform from a recursive viewpoint**  
Gloria Paradisi, Hugues Randriam  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411069  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this note we construct a quantum Fourier transform circuit in a recursive way, by directly copying the 'divide and conquer' construction of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, rather than using the explicit formula that is given in most introductory texts to quantum computation. We do not pretend this presentation to be original, nor claim for any anteriority. The aim of this paper is purely pedagogical.

**6.    Exciton photon strong-coupling regime for a single quantum dot in a microcavity**  
Emmanuelle Peter, Pascale Senellart, David Martrou, Aristide Lemaitre, Jacqueline Bloch, Julien Hours, Jean-Michel Gerard  
Physical Review Letters 95 (2005) 067401  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411076  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on the observation of the strong coupling regime between a single GaAs quantum dot and a microdisk optical mode. Photoluminescence is performed at various temperatures to tune the quantum dot exciton with respect to the optical mode. At resonance, we observe an anticrossing, signature of the strong coupling regime with a well resolved doublet. The Vacuum Rabi splitting amounts to 400 &#956;eV and is twice as large as the individual linewidths.

**7.    Quantum Fast Fourier Transform Viewed as a Special Case of Recursive Application of Cosine-Sine Decomposition**  
Robert R. Tucci  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411097  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum compiler is a software program for decomposing ("compiling") an arbitrary unitary matrix into a sequence of elementary operations (SEO). Coppersmith showed that the $\nb$-bit Discrete Fourier Transform matrix $U_{FT}$ can be decomposed in a very efficient way, as a sequence of order($\nb^2$) elementary operations. Can a quantum compiler that doesn't know a priori about Coppersmith's decomposition nevertheless decompose $U_{FT}$ as a sequence of order($\nb^2$) elementary operations? In other words, can it rediscover Coppersmith's decomposition by following a much more general algorithm? Yes it can, if that more general algorithm is the recursive application of the Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD).

**8.    Conditions for strictly purity-decreasing quantum Markovian dynamics**  
D.A. Lidar, A. Shabani, R. Alicki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411119  
<blockquote>
<p>
The purity, Tr(rho^2), measures how pure or mixed a quantum state rho is. It is well known that quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve the identity operator (which we refer to as unital) are strictly purity-decreasing transformations. Here we provide an almost complete characterization of the class of strictly purity-decreasing quantum dynamical semigroups. We show that in the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces a dynamical semigroup is strictly purity-decreasing if and only if it is unital, while in the infinite dimensional case, unitality is only sufficient.

**9.    Quantum Walks with Entangled Coins**  
S.E. Venegas-Andraca, J.L. Ball, K. Burnett, S. Bose  
New Journal of Physics 7 (2005) 221  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411151  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a mathematical formalism for the description of unrestricted quantum walks with entangled coins and one walker. The numerical behaviour of such walks is examined when using a Bell state as the initial coin state, two different coin operators, two different shift operators, and one walker. We compare and contrast the performance of these quantum walks with that of a classical random walk consisting of one walker and two maximally correlated coins as well as quantum walks with coins sharing different degrees of entanglement. We illustrate that the behaviour of our walk with entangled coins can be very different in comparison to the usual quantum walk with a single coin. We also demonstrate that simply by changing the shift operator, we can generate widely different distributions. We also compare the behaviour of quantum walks with maximally entangled coins with that of quantum walks with non-entangled coins. Finally, we show that the use of different shift operators on 2 and 3 qubit coins leads to different position probability distributions in 1 and 2 dimensional graphs.

**12.    Robust Quantum Algorithms for Oracle Identification**  
Andris Ambainis, Kazuo Iwama, Akinori Kawachi, Rudy Raymond, Shigeru Yamashita  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411204  
<blockquote>
<p>
The oracle identification problem (OIP) was introduced by Ambainis et al. \cite{AIKMRY04}. It is given as a set $S$ of $M$ oracles and a blackbox oracle $f$. Our task is to figure out which oracle in $S$ is equal to the blackbox $f$ by making queries to $f$. OIP includes several problems such as the Grover Search as special cases. In this paper, we improve the algorithms in \cite{AIKMRY04} by providing a mostly optimal upper bound of query complexity for this problem: ($i$) For any oracle set $S$ such that $|S| \le 2^{N^d}$ ($d < 1$), we design an algorithm whose query complexity is $O(\sqrt{N\log{M}/\log{N}})$, matching the lower bound proved in \cite{AIKMRY04}. ($ii$) Our algorithm also works for the range between $2^{N^d}$ and $2^{N/\log{N}}$ (where the bound becomes O(N)), but the gap between the upper and lower bounds worsens gradually. ($iii$) Our algorithm is robust, namely, it exhibits the same performance (up to a constant factor) against the noisy oracles as also shown in the literatures \cite{AC02,BNRW03,HMW03} for special cases of OIP.

**13.    Non-Markovian Particle Dynamics in Continuously Controlled Quantum Gases**  
D. Ivanov, S. Wallentowitz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411208  
<blockquote>
<p>
For a quantum gas, being subject to continuous feedback of a macroscopic observable, the single-particle dynamics is studied. Albeit feedback-induced particle correlations, it is shown that analytic solutions are obtained by formally extending the single-particle Hilbert space by an auxiliary degree of freedom. The particle's motion is then fed by colored noise, which effectively maps quantum-statistical correlations onto the single particle. Thus, the single particle in the continuously controlled gas follows a non-Markovian trajectory in phase-space.

**14.    Split-step Fourier methods for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation**  
Juha Javanainen, Janne Ruostekoski  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) L179  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411154  
<blockquote>
<p>
We perform a systematic study of the accuracy of split-step Fourier transform methods for the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation using symbolic calculation. Provided the most recent approximation for the wave function is always used in the nonlinear atom-atom interaction potential energy, every split-step algorithm we have tried has the same-order time stepping error for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Schroedinger equation.

**15.    Shape resonances for ultracold atom gases in carbon nanotube waveguides**  
V. Peano, M. Thorwart, C. Mora, R. Egger  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411517  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimentally viable setup for the realization of one-dimensional ultracold atom gases in a nanoscale magnetic waveguide formed by two doubly-clamped suspended carbon nanotubes. All common decoherence and atom loss mechanisms are shown to be small. We discuss general consequences of a non-parabolic confinement potential, in particular novel two-body shape resonances, which could be observed in this trap.

**16.    Rough surface scattering in many-mode conducting channels: Gradient versus amplitude scattering**  
F.M.Izrailev, N.M.Makarov, M.Rendon  
Phys. Stat. Sol. (b) 242 (2005) 1224  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411739  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of surface scattering on transport properties in many-mode conducting channels (electron waveguides). Assuming a strong roughness of the surface profiles, we show that there are two independent control parameters that determine statistical properties of the scattering. The first parameter is the ratio of the amplitude of the roughness to the transverse width of the waveguide. The second one, which is typically omitted, is determined by the mean value of the derivative of the profile. This parameter may be large, thus leading to specific properties of scattering. Our results may be used in experimental realizations of the surface scattering of electron waves, as well as for other applications (e.g., for optical and microwave waveguides)

**17.    Lower bounds on the Deterministic and Quantum Communication Complexity of Hamming Distance**  
Andris Ambainis, William Gasarch, Aravind Srinavasan, Andrey Utis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0411076  
<blockquote>
<p>
Alice and Bob want to know if two strings of length n are almost equal. That is, do they differ on \textit{at most} a bits? Let 0\leq a\leq n-1. We show that any deterministic protocol, as well as any error-free quantum protocol (C* version), for this problem requires at least n-2 bits of communication. We show the same bounds for the problem of determining if two strings differ in exactly a bits. We also prove a lower bound of n/2-1 for error-free Q* quantum protocols. Our results are obtained by lower-bounding the ranks of the appropriate matrices.

**18.    Quantum Effect and Curvature Strength of Naked Singularities**  
Umpei Miyamoto, Hideki Maeda, Tomohiro Harada  
Prog.Theor.Phys.113:513-533,2005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0411100  
<blockquote>
<p>
There are many solutions to the Einstein field equations that demonstrate naked singularity (NS) formation after regular evolution. It is possible, however, that such a quantum effect as particle creation prevents NSs from forming. We investigate the relation between the curvature strength and the quantum effects of NSs in a very wide class of spherical dust collapse. Through a perturbative calculation, we find that if the NS is very strong, the quantum particle creation diverges as the Cauchy horizon is approached, while if the NS is very weak, the creation should be finite. In the context of cosmic censorship, strong NSs will be subjected to the backreaction of quantum effects and may disappear or be hidden behind horizons, while weak NSs will not.
