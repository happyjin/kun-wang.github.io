**1.    Continuous variable teleportation of single photon states**  
Toshiki Ide, Holger F. Hofmann, Takayoshi Kobayashi, Akira Furusawa  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 012313 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104014  
<blockquote>
<p>
The properties of continuous variable teleportation of single photon states are investigated. The output state is different from the input state due to the non-maximal entanglement in the EPR beams. The photon statistics of the teleportation output are determined and the correlation between the field information beta obtained in the teleportation process and the change in photon number is discussed. The results of the output photon statistics are applied to the transmission of a qbit encoded in the polarization of a single photon.

**2.    Entanglement Concentration of Individual Photon Pairs via Linear Optical Logic**  
Chuanwei Zhang  
Quantum Information and Computation, 4, 196 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104054  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for concentrating nonmaximally pure and mixed polarization-entangled state of individual photon pairs. The scheme uses only simple linear optical elements and may be feasible within current optical technology.

**3.    Programming physical realizations of quantum computers**  
Hans De Raedt, Kristel Michielsen, Anthony Hams, Seiji Miyashita, Keiji Saito  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104085  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study effects of the physical realization of quantum computers on their logical operation. Through simulation of physical models of quantum computer hardware, we analyze the difficulties that are encountered in programming physical realizations of quantum computers. Examples of logically identical implementations of the controlled-NOT operation and Grover's database search algorithm are used to demonstrate that the results of a quantum computation are unstable with respect to the physical realization of the quantum computer. We discuss the origin of these instabilities and discuss possibilities to overcome this, for practical purposes, fundamental limitation of quantum computers.

**4.    Enhanced Autocompensating Quantum Cryptography System**  
Donald S. Bethune, Martha Navarro, William P. Risk  
Applied Optics LP 41 (2002) 1640-1648  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104089  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have improved the hardware and software of our autocompensating system for quantum key distribution by replacing bulk optical components at the end stations with fiber-optic equivalents and implementing software that synchronizes end-station activities, communicates basis choices, corrects errors and performs privacy amplification over a local area network. The all fiber-optic arrangement provides stable, efficient and high-contrast routing of the photons. The low bit error rate leads to high error correction efficiency and minimizes data sacrifice during privacy amplification. Characterization measurements made on a number of commercial avalanche photodiodes are presented that highlight the need for improved devices tailored specifically for quantum information applications. A scheme for frequency shifting the photons returning from Alice's station to allow them to be distinguished from backscattered noise photons is also described. OCIS codes: 030.5260, 060.0060, 060.2360, 230.2240, 270.5570.

**5.    Generation and manipulation of squeezed states of light in optical networks for quantum communication and computation**  
Maxim Raginsky, Prem Kumar  
J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 3, L1-L4 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104120  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze a fiber-optic component which could find multiple uses in novel information-processing systems utilizing squeezed states of light. Our approach is based on the phenomenon of photon-number squeezing of soliton noise after the soliton has propagated through a nonlinear optical fiber. Applications of this component in optical networks for quantum computation and quantum cryptography are discussed.

**6.    Quantum Walks on the Hypercube**  
Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104137  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, it has been shown that one-dimensional quantum walks can mix more quickly than classical random walks, suggesting that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms can outperform their classical counterparts. We study two quantum walks on the n-dimensional hypercube, one in discrete time and one in continuous time. In both cases we show that the quantum walk mixes in (\pi/4)n steps, faster than the O(n log n) steps required by the classical walk. In the continuous-time case, the probability distribution is {\em exactly} uniform at this time. More importantly, these walks expose several subtleties in the definition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time walk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it never approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen randomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between terms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the cycle; previous general bounds predict an exponential, rather than linear, mixing time for the hypercube.
