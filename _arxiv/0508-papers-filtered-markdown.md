<blockquote>
<p>
We briefly discuss recent experiments on quantum information processing using trapped ions at NIST. A central theme of this work has been to increase our capabilities in terms of quantum computing protocols, but we have also applied the same concepts to improved metrology, particularly in the area of frequency standards and atomic clocks. Such work may eventually shed light on more fundamental issues, such as the quantum measurement problem.

**2.    Grover like Operator Using Only Single-Qubit Gates**  
Go Kato  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508081  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new quantum circuit for the quantum search problem. The quantum circuit is superior to Grover's algorithm in some realistic cases. The reasons for the superiority are in short as follows: In the quantum circuit proposed in this paper, all the operators except for the oracle can be written as direct products of single-qubit gates. Such separable operators can be executed much faster than multi-particle operators, such as c-NOT gates and Toffoli gates, in many realistic systems. The idea of this quantum circuit is inspired by the Hamiltonian used in the adiabatic quantum computer. In addition, the scaling of the number of oracle calls for this circuit is the same as that for Grover's algorithm, i.e. $O(2^{n/2})$.

**3.    High Resolution Rydberg Spectroscopy of ultracold Rubidium Atoms**  
Axel Grabowski, Rolf Heidemann, Robert L?w, JÃ¼rgen Stuhler, Tilman Pfau  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508082  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present experiments on two-photon excitation of ${\rm ^{87}}$Rb atoms to Rydberg states. For this purpose, two continuous-wave (cw)-laser systems for both 780 nm and 480 nm have been set up. These systems are optimized to a small linewidth (well below 1 MHz) to get both an efficient excitation process and good spectroscopic resolution. To test the performance of our laser system, we investigated the Stark splitting of Rydberg states. For n=40 we were able to see the hyperfine levels splitting in the electrical field for different finestructure states. To show the ability of spatially selective excitation to Rydberg states, we excited rubidium atoms in an electrical field gradient and investigated both linewidths and lineshifts. Furthermore we were able to excite the atoms selectively from the two hyperfine ground states to Rydberg states. Finally, we investigated the Autler-Townes splitting of the 5S$_{1/2}$$\to$5P$_{3/2}$ transition via a Rydberg state to determine the Rabi frequency of this excitation step.

**4.    Relativistic quantum walks**  
Frederick W. Strauch  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 054302 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508096  
<blockquote>
<p>
By pursuing the deep relation between the one-dimensional Dirac equation and quantum walks, the physical role of quantum interference in the latter is explained. It is shown that the time evolution of the probability density of a quantum walker, initially localized on a lattice, is directly analogous to relativistic wave-packet spreading. Analytic wave-packet solutions reveal a striking connection between the discrete and continuous time quantum walks.

**5.    The Groverian Measure of Entanglement for Mixed States**  
Daniel Shapira, Yishai Shimoni, Ofer Biham  
Phys. Rev A. 73, 044301 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508108  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Groverian entanglement measure introduced earlier for pure quantum states [O. Biham, M.A. Nielsen and T. Osborne, Phys. Rev. A 65, 062312 (2002)] is generalized to the case of mixed states, in a way that maintains its operational interpretation. The Groverian measure of a mixed state of n qubits is obtained by a purification procedure into a pure state of 2n qubits, followed by an optimization process based on Uhlmann's theorem, before the resulting state is fed into Grover's search algorithm. The Groverian measure, expressed in terms of the maximal success probability of the algorithm, provides an operational measure of entanglement of both pure and mixed quantum states of multiple qubits. These results may provide further insight into the role of entanglement in making quantum algorithms powerful.

**6.    An introduction to measurement based quantum computation**  
Richard Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508124  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the formalism of measurement based quantum computation we start with a given fixed entangled state of many qubits and perform computation by applying a sequence of measurements to designated qubits in designated bases. The choice of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer (1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared to the gate array model, especially issues of parallelisability of algorithms.

**7.    Scalable Quantum Computing with "Enhancement" Quantum Dots**  
Y. B. Lyanda-Geller, M. J. Yang, C. H. Yang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508126  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel scheme of solid state realization of a quantum computer based on single spin "enhancement mode" quantum dots as building blocks. In the enhancement quantum dots, just one electron can be brought into initially empty dot, in contrast to depletion mode dots based on expelling of electrons from multi-electron dots by gates. The quantum computer architectures based on depletion dots are confronted by several challenges making scalability difficult. These challenges can be successfully met by the approach based on ehnancement mode, capable of producing square array of dots with versatile functionalities. These functionalities allow transportation of qubits, including teleportation, and error correction based on straightforward one- and two-qubit operations. We describe physical properties and demonstrate experimental characteristics of enhancement quantum dots and single-electron transistors based on InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells. We discuss the materials aspects of quantum dot quantum computing, including the materials with large spin splitting such as InAs, as well as perspectives of enhancement mode approach in materials such as Si.

**8.    Stabilizer Formalism for Operator Quantum Error Correction**  
David Poulin  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 230504 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508131  
<blockquote>
<p>
Operator quantum error correction is a recently developed theory that provides a generalized framework for active error correction and passive error avoiding schemes. In this paper, we describe these codes in the stabilizer formalism of standard quantum error correction theory. This is achieved by adding a "gauge" group to the standard stabilizer definition of a code that defines an equivalence class between encoded states. Gauge transformations leave the encoded information unchanged; their effect is absorbed by virtual gauge qubits that do not carry useful information. We illustrate the construction by identifying a gauge symmetry in Shor's 9-qubit code that allows us to remove 4 of its 8 stabilizer generators, leading to a simpler decoding procedure and a wider class of logical operations without affecting its essential properties. This opens the path to possible improvements of the error threshold of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

**9.    A two reservoir model of quantum error correction**  
James P. Clemens, Julio Gea-Banacloche  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508155  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a two reservoir model of quantum error correction with a hot bath causing errors in the qubits and a cold bath cooling the ancilla qubits to a fiducial state. We consider error correction protocols both with and without measurement of the ancilla state. The error correction acts as a kind of refrigeration process to maintain the data qubits in a low entropy state by periodically moving the entropy to the ancilla qubits and then to the cold reservoir. We quantify the performance of the error correction as a function of the reservoir temperatures and cooling rate by means of the fidelity and the residual entropy of the data qubits. We also make a comparison with the continuous quantum error correction model of Sarovar and Milburn [Phys. Rev. A 72 012306].

**10.    A Processor Core Model for Quantum Computing**  
Man-Hong Yung, Simon C. Benjamin, Sougato Bose  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 220501 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508165  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe an architecture based on a processing 'core' where multiple qubits interact perpetually, and a separate 'store' where qubits exist in isolation. Computation consists of single qubit operations, swaps between the store and the core, and free evolution of the core. This enables computation using physical systems where the entangling interactions are 'always on'. Alternatively, for switchable systems our model constitutes a prescription for optimizing many-qubit gates. We discuss implementations of the quantum Fourier transform, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum error correction.

**11.    Experimental purification of coherent states**  
Ulrik L. Andersen, Radim Filip, Jaromir Fiurasek, Vincent Josse, Gerd Leuchs  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 060301 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508178  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for optimal Gaussian purification of coherent states from several imperfect copies. The proposal is experimentally demonstrated for the case of two copies of a coherent state sent through independent noisy channels. Our purification protocol relies on only linear optics and an ancilla vacuum state, rendering this approach an interesting alternative to the more complex protocols of entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.

**12.    Parametric down-conversion in photonic crystal waveguides**  
Gregor Weihs  
Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 20, 1543-1550 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508179  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic crystals create dramatic new possibilities for nonlinear optics. Line defects are shown to support modes suitable for the production of pairs of photons by the material's second order nonlinearity even if the phase-matching conditions cannot be satisfied in the bulk. These structures offer the flexibility to achieve specific dispersion characteristics and potentially very high brightness. In this work, two phase matching schemes are identified and analyzed regarding their dispersive properties.

**13.    Lower bounds on the absorption probability of beam splitters**  
Stefan Scheel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508189  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a lower limit to the amount of absorptive loss present in passive linear optical devices such as a beam splitter. We choose a particularly simple beam splitter geometry, a single planar slab surrounded by vacuum, which already reveals the important features of the theory. It is shown that, using general causality requirements and statistical arguments, the lower bound depends on the frequency of the incident light and the transverse resonance frequency of a suitably chosen single-resonance model only. For symmetric beam splitters and reasonable assumptions on the resonance frequency $\omega_T$, the lower absorption bound is $p_{\min}\approx 10^{-6}(\omega/\omega_T)^4$.

**14.    A new quantum lower bound method, with an application to strong direct product theorem for quantum search**  
Andris Ambainis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508200  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new method for proving lower bounds on quantum query algorithms. The new method is an extension of adversary method, by analyzing the eigenspace structure of the problem. Using the new method, we prove a strong direct product theorem for quantum search. This result was previously proven by Klauck, Spalek and de Wolf (quant-ph/0402123) using polynomials method. No proof using adversary method was known before.

**15.    Quantum Algorithms for Matching and Network Flows**  
Andris Ambainis, Robert Spalek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508205  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present quantum algorithms for the following graph problems: finding a maximal bipartite matching in time O(n sqrt{m+n} log n), finding a maximal non-bipartite matching in time O(n^2 (sqrt{m/n} + log n) log n), and finding a maximal flow in an integer network in time O(min(n^{7/6} sqrt m * U^{1/3}, sqrt{n U} m) log n), where n is the number of vertices, m is the number of edges, and U <= n^{1/4} is an upper bound on the capacity of an edge.

**16.    Cryptography In the Bounded Quantum-Storage Model**  
Ivan Damgaard, Serge Fehr, Louis Salvail, Christian Schaffner  
Proceedings of the 46th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science - FOCS 2005, pages 449-458  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508222  
<blockquote>
<p>
We initiate the study of two-party cryptographic primitives with unconditional security, assuming that the adversary's quantum memory is of bounded size. We show that oblivious transfer and bit commitment can be implemented in this model using protocols where honest parties need no quantum memory, whereas an adversarial player needs quantum memory of size at least n/2 in order to break the protocol, where n is the number of qubits transmitted. This is in sharp contrast to the classical bounded-memory model, where we can only tolerate adversaries with memory of size quadratic in honest players' memory size. Our protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be implemented using today's technology. On the technical side, a new entropic uncertainty relation involving min-entropy is established.

**17.    Decoherence by Correlated Noise and Quantum Error Correction**  
E. Novais, Harold U. Baranger  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 040501 (2006).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508228  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the decoherence of a quantum computer in an environment which is inherently correlated in time and space. We first derive the nonunitary time evolution of the computer and environment in the presence of a stabilizer error correction code, providing a general way to quantify decoherence for a quantum computer. The general theory is then applied to the spin-boson model. Our results demonstrate that effects of long-range correlations can be systematically reduced by small changes in the error correction codes.

**18.    Probing spacetime foam with extragalactic sources**  
W.A. Christiansen, Y. Jack Ng, H. van Dam  
Phys.Rev.Lett. 96 (2006) 051301  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0508121  
<blockquote>
<p>
Due to quantum fluctuations, spacetime is probably ``foamy'' on very small scales. We propose to detect this texture of spacetime foam by looking for core-halo structures in the images of distant quasars. We find that the Very Large Telescope interferometer will be on the verge of being able to probe the fabric of spacetime when it reaches its design performance. Our method also allows us to use spacetime foam physics and physics of computation to infer the existence of dark energy/matter, independent of the evidence from recent cosmological observations.
