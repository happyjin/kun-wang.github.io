**1.    One-step error correction for multipartite polarization entanglement**  
Fu-Guo Deng  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 062316 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0093  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two economical one-step error-correction protocols for multipartite polarization-entangled systems in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. One uses spatial entanglement to correct errors in the polarization entanglement of an N-photon system, resorting to linear optical elements. The other uses frequency entanglement to correct errors in the polarization entanglement of an N-photon system. The parties in quantum communication can obtain a maximally entangled state from each N-photon system transmitted with one step in these two protocols, and both of their success probabilities are 100%, in principle. That is, they both work in a deterministic way, and they do not largely consume the less-entangled photon systems, which is far different from conventional multipartite entanglement purification schemes. These features may make these two protocols more useful for practical applications in long-distance quantum communication.

**2.    Non-Markovian dynamics of system-reservoir entanglement**  
Francesco Plastina, Sabrina Maniscalco  
Int. J. Quant. Info. 9, 1725 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0110  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using an exact approach, we study the dynamics of entanglement between two qubits coupled to independent reservoirs and between the two, initially disentangled, reservoirs. We also describe the transfer of bipartite entanglement from the two-qubits to their respective reservoirs focussing on the case of two atoms inside two different leaky cavities with a specific attention to the role of the detuning. We present a scheme to prepare the cavity fields in a maximally entangled state, without direct interaction between the cavities, by exploiting the initial qubits entanglement. We discuss a deterministic protocol, working in the presence of cavity losses, for the generation of a W-state of one qubit and two cavity fields and we describe a probabilistic scheme to entangle one of the atoms with the reservoir (cavity field) of the other atom.

**3.    Experimental demonstration of a Hadamard gate for coherent state qubits**  
Anders Tipsmark, Ruifang Dong, Amine Laghaout, Petr Marek, Miroslav Jezek, Ulrik L. Andersen  
Physical Review A 84, 050301(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0822  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss and experimentally demonstrate a probabilistic Hadamard gate for coherent state qubits. The scheme is based on linear optical components, non-classical resources and the joint projective action of a photon counter and a homodyne detector. We experimentally characterize the gate for the coherent states of the computational basis by full tomographic reconstruction of the transformed output states. Based on the parameters of the experiment we simulate the fidelity for all coherent state qubits on the Bloch sphere.

**4.    Two-Photon Scattering by a Cavity-Coupled Two-Level Emitter in a One-Dimensional Waveguide**  
Zhongling Ji, Shaoyan Gao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1934  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that two-photon transport can be modulated by a two-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a one-dimensional waveguide. In the ordinary case, the transmitted light has a wider frequency spectrum than the situation without the cavity because it is reflected and scattered many times. But when the two photons are resonant with the cavity resonance reflection frequency, the frequency spectrum of the transmitted light becomes narrower than that without the cavity. This means that properly tuning the cavity resonance frequency can improve the photon-photon interaction. In addition, we show that the two-photon intensity correlation functions are nearly opposite to each other at the two sides of the emitter transition frequency rather than be the same, which is exactly the Fano resonance line shape for two photons. Such an effect is important for lowering the power threshold in optical bistable devices and for sensing applications. When the emitter transition frequency equals to the cavity resonance frequency for a high-Q cavity, our results agree with the recent experiments and theories.

**5.    Multichannel Effects near Confinement-Induced Resonances in Harmonic Waveguides**  
Vladimir S. Melezhik, Peter Schmelcher  
Phys.Rev.A84, 042712(2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2501  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the impact of multichannel scattering in harmonic waveguides on the positions and widths of confinement-induced resonances for both isotropic and anisotropic transversal confinement. Multichannel scattering amplitudes and transmission coefficients are calculated and used to characterize the resonant behaviour of atomic collisions with varying anisotropy. A mechanism is established which leads to a splitting of the confinement-induced resonance in the presence of anisotropy.

**6.    Shaping an Itinerant Quantum Field by Dissipation**  
Diego Porras, Juan José García-Ripoll  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 043602 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2607  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that inducing sidebands in the emission of a single emitter into a one dimensional waveguide, together with a dissipative re-pumping process, a photon field is cooled down to a squeezed vacuum. Our method does not require to be in the strong coupling regime, works with a continuum of propagating field modes and it may lead to sources of tunable multimode squeezed light in circuit QED systems.

**7.    Hitting Time of Quantum Walks with Perturbation**  
Chen-Fu Chiang, Guillermo Gomez  
Quantum Information Processing (Feb. 9), pp.~1-12, Springer, (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2965  
<blockquote>
<p>
The hitting time is the required minimum time for a Markov chain-based walk (classical or quantum) to reach a target state in the state space. We investigate the effect of the perturbation on the hitting time of a quantum walk. We obtain an upper bound for the perturbed quantum walk hitting time by applying Szegedy's work and the perturbation bounds with Weyl's perturbation theorem on classical matrix. Based on the definition of quantum hitting time given in MNRS algorithm, we further compute the delayed perturbed hitting time (DPHT) and delayed perturbed quantum hitting time (DPQHT). We show that the upper bound for DPQHT is actually greater than the difference between the square root of the upper bound for a perturbed random walk and the square root of the lower bound for a random walk.

**8.    Quantum Filtering for Systems Driven by Fields in Single Photon States and Superposition of Coherent States using Non-Markovian Embeddings**  
J.E. Gough, M.R. James, H.I. Nurdin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2974  
<blockquote>
<p>
The purpose of this paper is to determine quantum master and filter equations for systems coupled to fields in certain non-classical continuous-mode states. Specifically, we consider two types of field states (i) single photon states, and (ii) superpositions of coherent states. The system and field are described using a quantum stochastic unitary model. Master equations are derived from this model and are given in terms of systems of coupled equations. The output field carries information about the system, and is continuously monitored. The quantum filters are determined with the aid of an embedding of the system into a larger non-Markovian system, and are given by a system of coupled stochastic differential equations.

**9.    Asymptotic distributions of quantum walks on the line with two entangled coins**  
Chaobin Liu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3346  
<blockquote>
<p>
We advance the previous studies of quantum walks on the line with two coins. Such four-state quantum walks driven by a three-direction shift operator may have nonzero stationary distributions (localization), thus distinguishing themselves from the quantum walks on the line in the basic scenario (i.e., driven by a single coin). In this work, asymptotic position distributions of the quantum walks are examined. We derive a weak limit for the quantum walks and explicit formulas of stationary probability distribution, whose dependencies on the coin parameter and the initial state of quantum walks are presented. In particular, it is shown that the weak limit for the present quantum walks can be of the form in the basic scenario of quantum walks on the line, for certain initial states of the walk and certain values of the coin parameter. In the case where localization occurs, we show that the stationary probability exponentially decays with the absolute value of a walker's position, independent of the parity of time.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate fast polarisation and path control of photons at 1550 nm in lithium niobate waveguide devices using the electro-optic effect. We show heralded single photon state engineering, quantum interference, fast state preparation of two entangled photons and feedback control of quantum interference. These results point the way to a single platform that will enable the integration of nonlinear single photon sources and fast reconfigurable circuits for future photonic quantum information science and technology.

**11.    Attojoule all-optical switching with a single quantum dot**  
Deepak Sridharan, Ranojoy Bose, Hyochul Kim Glenn S. Solomon, Edo Waks  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3751  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate the dynamic nonlinear response of a single quantum dot (QD) strongly coupled to a photonic crystal cavity-waveguide structure. The temporal response is measured by pump-probe excitation where a control pulse propagating through the waveguide is used to create an optical Stark shift on the QD, resulting in a large modification of the cavity reflectivity. This optically induced cavity reflectivity modification switches the propagation direction of a detuned signal pulse. Using this device we demonstrate all-optical switching with only 14 attojoules of control pulse energy. The response time of the switch is measured to be up to 8.4 GHz, which is primarily limited by the cavity-QD interaction strength.

**12.    Where to quantum walk**  
Viv Kendon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3795  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum versions of random walks have diverse applications that are motivating experimental implementations as well as theoretical studies. However, the main impetus behind this interest is their use in quantum algorithms, which have always employed the quantum walk in the form of a program running on a quantum computer. Recent results showing that quantum walks are "universal for quantum computation" relate entirely to algorithms, and do not imply that a physical quantum walk could provide a new architecture for quantum computers. Nonetheless, quantum walks used to model transport phenomena in spin chains and biomolecules broaden their scope well beyond algorithms, and reopen the question of when a physical implementation might provide useful computational outputs. In this article we determine the conditions under which a physical quantum walk experiment could provide useful results beyond the reach of classical computation.

**13.    Transverse Ising Model: Markovian evolution of classical and quantum correlations under decoherence**  
Amit Kumar Pal, Indrani Bose  
Eur. Phys. J. B, Volume 85, Number 1, Article Number 36, January 2012  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3939  
<blockquote>
<p>
The transverse Ising Model (TIM) in one dimension is the simplest model which exhibits a quantum phase transition (QPT). Quantities related to quantum information theoretic measures like entanglement, quantum discord (QD) and fidelity are known to provide signatures of QPTs. The issue is less well explored when the quantum system is subjected to decoherence due to its interaction, represented by a quantum channel, with an environment. In this paper we study the dynamics of the mutual information $I(\rho_{AB})$, the classical correlations $C(\rho_{AB})$ and the quantum correlations $Q(\rho_{AB})$, as measured by the QD, in a two-qubit state the density matrix of which is the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground state of the TIM in 1d. The time evolution brought about by system-environment interactions is assumed to be Markovian in nature and the quantum channels considered are amplitude damping, bit-flip, phase-flip and bit-phase-flip. Each quantum channel is shown to be distinguished by a specific type of dynamics. In the case of the phase-flip channel, there is a finite time interval in which the quantum correlations are larger in magnitude than the classical correlations. For this channel as well as the bit-phase-flip channel, appropriate quantities associated with the dynamics of the correlations can be derived which signal the occurrence of a QPT.

**14.    The Capabilities of a Perturbed Toric Code as a Quantum Memory**  
Alastair Kay  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 270502 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3940  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the effect of typical, unknown perturbations on the 2D toric code when acting as a quantum memory, incorporating the effects of error correction on read-out. By transforming the system into a 1D transverse Ising model undergoing an instantaneous quench, and making extensive use of Lieb-Robinson bounds, we prove that for a large class of perturbations, the survival time of stored information grows at least logarithmically with the system size. A uniform magnetic field saturates this scaling behavior. We show that randomizing the stabilizer strengths gives a polynomial survival time with a degree that depends on the strength of the perturbation.

**15.    Framework for discrete-time quantum walks and a symmetric walk on a binary tree**  
Zlatko Dimcovic, Daniel Rockwell, Ian Milligan, Robert M. Burton, Thinh Nguyen, Yevgeniy Kovchegov  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 032311 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4201  
<blockquote>
<p>
We formulate a framework for discrete-time quantum walks, motivated by classical random walks with memory. We present a specific representation of the classical walk with memory 2 on which this is based. The framework has no need for coin spaces, it imposes no constraints on the evolution operator other than unitarity, and is unifying of other approaches. As an example we construct a symmetric discrete-time quantum walk on the semi-infinite binary tree. The generating function of the amplitude at the root is computed in closed-form, as a function of time and the initial level n in the tree, and we find the asymptotic and a full numerical solution for the amplitude. It exhibits a sharp interference peak and a power law tail, as opposed to the exponentially decaying tail of a broadly peaked distribution of the classical symmetric random walk on a binary tree. The probability peak is orders of magnitude larger than it is for the classical walk (already at small n). The quantum walk shows a polynomial algorithmic speedup in n over the classical walk, which we conjecture to be of the order 2/3, based on strong trends in data.

**16.    Robust quantum gates for systems subject to decoherence via optimal control: Markovian vs non-Markovian dynamics**  
Frederik Floether, Pierre de Fouquieres, Sophie Schirmer  
New Journal of Physics 14, 073023 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4358  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the implementation of one-, two-, and three-qubit quantum gates for interacting qubits using optimal control. Different Markovian and non-Markovian environments are compared and efficient optimisation algorithms utilising analytic gradient expressions and quasi-Newton updates are given for both cases. The performance of the algorithms is analysed for a large set of problems in terms of the fidelities attained and the observed convergence behaviour. New notions of success rate and success speed are introduced and density plots are utilised to study the effect of key parameters, such as gate operation times, and random variables, such as the initial fields required to start the iterative algorithm. Core characteristics of the optimal fields are statistically analysed. Substantial differences between Markovian and non-Markovian environments in terms of the possibilities for control and the control mechanisms are uncovered. In particular, in the Markovian case it is found that the optimal fields obtained without considering the environment cannot be improved substantially by taking the environment into account and the fidelities attained are determined mostly by the gate operation time as well as the overall strength of the environmental effects. Computation time is saved if the fields are pre-optimised neglecting decoherence. In the non-Markovian case, on the other hand, substantial improvements in the fidelities are observed when the details of the system-bath coupling are taken into account. In that case, field leakage is shown to be a significant issue which can make high gate fidelities impossible to obtain unless both the system and noise qubits are fully controlled.

**17.    Quasideterministic realization of a universal quantum gate in a single scattering process**  
F. Ciccarello, D. E. Browne, L. C. Kwek, H. Schomerus, M. Zarcone, S. Bose  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 050305(R) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4394  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a flying particle, such as an electron or a photon, scattering along a one-dimensional waveguide from a pair of static spin-1/2 centers, such as quantum dots, can implement a CZ gate (universal for quantum computation) between them. This occurs quasi-deterministically in a single scattering event, hence with no need for any post-selection or iteration, {and} without demanding the flying particle to bear any internal spin. We show that an easily matched hard-wall boundary condition along with the elastic nature of the process are key to such performances.

**18.    Alternate two-dimensional quantum walk with a single-qubit coin**  
C. Di Franco, M. Mc Gettrick, T. Machida, Th. Busch  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 042337 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4400  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have recently proposed a two-dimensional quantum walk where the requirement of a higher dimensionality of the coin space is substituted with the alternance of the directions in which the walker can move [C. Di Franco, M. Mc Gettrick, and Th. Busch, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 080502 (2011)]. For a particular initial state of the coin, this walk is able to perfectly reproduce the spatial probability distribution of the non-localized case of the Grover walk. Here, we present a more detailed proof of this equivalence. We also extend the analysis to other initial states, in order to provide a more complete picture of our walk. We show that this scheme outperforms the Grover walk in the generation of $x$-$y$ spatial entanglement for any initial condition, with the maximum entanglement obtained in the case of the particular aforementioned state. Finally, the equivalence is generalized to wider classes of quantum walks and a limit theorem for the alternate walk in this context is presented.

**19.    Limit measures of inhomogeneous discrete-time quantum walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno, Tomasz Luczak, Etsuo Segawa  
Quantum Information Processing 12 (2013) pp. 33-53  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4462  
<blockquote>
<p>
We treat three types of measures of the quantum walk (QW) with the spatial perturbation at the origin, which was introduced by [1]: time averaged limit measure, weak limit measure, and stationary measure. From the first two measures, we see a coexistence of the ballistic and localized behaviors in the walk as a sequential result following [1,2]. We propose a universality class of QWs with respect to weak limit measure. It is shown that typical spatial homogeneous QWs with ballistic spreading belong to the universality class. We find that the walk treated here with one defect also belongs to the class. We mainly consider the walk starting from the origin. However when we remove this restriction, we obtain a stationary measure of the walk. As a consequence, by choosing parameters in the stationary measure, we get the uniform measure as a stationary measure of the Hadamard walk and a time averaged limit measure of the walk with one defect respectively.

**20.    libCreme: An optimization library for evaluating convex-roof entanglement measures**  
Beat R?thlisberger, J?rg Lehmann, Daniel Loss  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4497  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the software library libCreme which we have previously used to successfully calculate convex-roof entanglement measures of mixed quantum states appearing in realistic physical systems. Evaluating the amount of entanglement in such states is in general a non-trivial task requiring to solve a highly non-linear complex optimization problem. The algorithms provided here are able to achieve to do this for a large and important class of entanglement measures. The library is mostly written in the Matlab programming language, but is fully compatible to the free and open-source Octave platform. Some inefficient subroutines are written in C/C++ for better performance. This manuscript discusses the most important theoretical concepts and workings of the algorithms, focussing on the actual implementation and usage within the library. Detailed examples in the end should make it easy for the user to apply libCreme to specific problems.

**21.    No-go theorem for passive single-rail linear optical quantum computing**  
Lian-Ao Wu, Philip Walther, Daniel A. Lidar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4646  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic quantum systems are among the most promising architectures for quantum computers. It is well known that for dual-rail photons effective non-linearities and near-deterministic non-trivial two-qubit gates can be achieved via the measurement process and by introducing ancillary photons. While in principle this opens a legitimate path to scalable linear optical quantum computing, the technical requirements are still very challenging and thus other optical encodings are being actively investigated. One of the alternatives is to use single-rail encoded photons, where entangled states can be deterministically generated. Here we prove that even for such systems universal optical quantum computing using only passive optical elements such as beam splitters and phase shifters is not possible. This no-go theorem proves that photon bunching cannot be passively suppressed even when extra ancilla modes and arbitrary number of photons are used. Our result provides useful guidance for the design of optical quantum computers.

Phys. Rev. A 85, 013812 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4813  
<blockquote>
<p>
We model optomechanical systems as linear optical amplifiers. This provides a unified treatment of diverse optomechanical phenomena. We emphasize, in particular, the relationship between ponderomotive squeezing and optomechanically induced transparency, two foci of current research. We characterize the amplifier response to quantum and deliberately applied fluctuations, both optical and mechanical. Further, we apply these results to establish quantum limits on external force sensing both on and off cavity resonance. We find that the maximum sensitivity attained on resonance constitutes an absolute upper limit, not surpassed when detuning off cavity resonance. The theory can be extended to a two-sided cavity with losses and limited detection efficiency.

**23.    Superradiance of Harmonic Oscillators**  
Michael Delanty, Stojan Rebic, Jason Twamley  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5080  
<blockquote>
<p>
Superradiance, the enhanced collective emission of light from a coherent ensemble of quantum systems, has been typically studied in atomic ensembles. In this work we study the enhanced emission of energy from coherent ensembles of harmonic oscillators. We show that it should be possible to observe harmonic oscillator superradiance in a variety of physical platforms such as waveguide arrays in integrated photonics and resonator arrays in circuit QED. We find general conditions specifying when emission is superradiant and subradiant and find that superradiant, subradiant and dark states take the form of multimode squeezed coherent states and highly entangled multimode Fock states. The intensity, two-mode correlations and fraction of quanta trapped in the system after decay are calculated for a range of initial states including multimode Fock, squeezed, coherent and thermal states. In order to explore these effects, the Law and Eberly protocol [C. K. Law and J. H. Eberly, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 1055 (1996)] is generalized to prepare highly entangled multimode Fock states in circuit QED.

**24.    Improving Quantum Clocks via Semidefinite Programming**  
Michael Mullan, Emanuel Knill  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5347  
<blockquote>
<p>
The accuracies of modern quantum logic clocks have surpassed those of standard atomic fountain clocks. These clocks also provide a greater degree of control, because before and after clock queries, we are able to apply chosen unitary operations and measurements. Here, we take advantage of these choices and present a numerical technique designed to increase the accuracy of these clocks. We use a greedy approach, minimizing the phase variance of a noisy classical oscillator with respect to a perfect frequency standard after an interrogation step; we do not optimize over successive interrogations or the probe times. We consider arbitrary prior frequency knowledge and compare clocks with varying numbers of ions and queries interlaced with unitary control. Our technique is based on the semidefinite programming formulation of quantum query complexity, a method first developed in the context of deriving algorithmic lower bounds. The application of semidefinite programming to an inherently continuous problem like that considered here requires discretization; we derive bounds on the error introduced and show that it can be made suitably small.

J. Mod. Opt. 47 (2000) 1055-1087  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5982  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we derive the quantum statistical and dynamical properties of nonlinear optical couplers composed of two nonlinear waveguides operating by the second subharmonic generation, which are coupled linearly through evanescent waves and nonlinearly through nondegenerate optical parametric interaction. Main attention is paid to generation and transmission of nonclassical light, based on a discussion of squeezing phenomenon, normalized second-order correlation function, and quasiprobability distribution functions. Initially coherent, number and thermal states of optical beams are considered. In particular, results are discussed in dependence on the strength of the nonlinear coupling relatively to the linear coupling. We show that if the Fock state $|1>$ enters the first waveguide and the vacuum state $|0>$ enters the second waveguide, the coupler can serve as a generator of squeezed vacuum state governed by the coupler parameters. Further, if thermal fields enter initially the waveguides the coupler plays similar role as a microwave Josephson-junction parametric amplifier to generate squeezed thermal light.

<blockquote>
<p>
We exploit the qubit-qubit coupling induced by plasmon-polariton modes in a one-dimensional nanowaveguide to obtain various two-qubit entanglement situations. Firstly, we observe three phenomena occurring when preparing the initial state of the system and leaving it freely relax: spontaneous formation of entanglement, sudden birth and revival. Then, we show that plugging a laser to each of the qubit, the system arrives to an steady state which, depending on their inter-qubit distance, can also be entangled. For this situation, we also characterize the quantum state of the system showing the entanglement-purity- diagram typical for two-qubit systems.

Particular attention is then paid to the special case of the Levy-Schroedinger equations and to their associated Levy-type Markov processes, and to a few examples of Cauchy background noise.

<blockquote>
<p>
Properties of the two-dimensional ring and three-dimensional infinitely long straight hollow waveguide with unit width and inner radius $\rho_0$ in the superposition of the longitudinal uniform magnetic field $\bf B$ and Aharonov-Bohm flux are analyzed within the framework of the scalar Helmholtz equation under the assumption that the Robin boundary conditions at the inner and outer confining walls contain extrapolation lengths $\Lambda_{in}$ and $\Lambda_{out}$, respectively, with nonzero imaginary parts. It is shown that, compared to the disk geometry, the annulus opens up additional possibilities of varying magnetization and currents by tuning imaginary components of the Robin parameters on each confining circumference; in particular, the possibility of restoring a lossless longitudinal flux by zeroing imaginary part $E_i$ of the total transverse energy $E$ is discussed. The energy $E$ turns real under special correlation between the imaginary parts of $\Lambda_{in}$ and $\Lambda_{out}$ with the opposite signs what physically corresponds to the equal transverse fluxes through the inner and outer interfaces of the annulus. In the asymptotic case of the very large radius, simple expressions are derived and applied to the analysis of the dependence of the real energy $E$ on $\Lambda_{in}$ and $\Lambda_{out}$. New features also emerge in the magnetic field influence; for example, if, for the quantum disk, the imaginary energy $E_i$ is quenched by the strong intensities $B$, then for the annulus this takes place only when the inner Robin distance $\Lambda_{in}$ is real; otherwise, it almost quadratically depends on $B$ with the corresponding enhancement of the reactive scattering. Closely related problem of the hole in the otherwise uniform medium is also addressed for real and complex extrapolation lengths with the emphasis on the comparative analysis with its dot counterpart.

<p>
An original approach is suggested to analysis of full quantum Liouville equation for single electron (quantum particle) interacting with ideal phonon gas (harmonic boson thermostat). It is shown that under the thermodynamic limit this equation can be exactly reduced to a system of evolution equations connecting density matrix of the electron and its simplest irreducible correlations with amplitudes of one, two, three and more phonon modes. Possible application of these new equations to explanation of the electron mobility 1/f-type fluctuations in semiconductors and other media is discussed. The special case of electron in static disorder is also considered.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an electrically tunable graphene-based metamaterial showing a large nonlinear optical response at THz frequencies, which we calculate analytically for the first time to our knowledge and arises from the intraband current. The structure sustains a novel type of stable two-dimensional spatial solitary wave, a relativistic version of the Townes soliton. These results can be also applied to any material exhibiting a conical dispersion with massless Dirac fermions.

Using the phenomenological expression for the level spacing distribution with only one parameter, $0 \leq \beta \leq \infty$, covering all regimes of chaos and complexity in a quantum system, we show that transport properties of the one-dimensional Anderson model of finite size can be expressed in terms of this parameter. Specifically, we demonstrate a strictly linear relation between $\beta$ and the normalized localization length for the whole transition from strongly localized to extended states. This result allows one to describe all transport properties in the open system entirely in terms of the parameter $\beta$ and strength of coupling to continuum. For non-perfect coupling, our data show a quite unusual interplay between the degree of internal chaos defined by $\beta$, and degree of openness of the model. The results can be experimentally tested in single-mode waveguides with either bulk or surface disorder.

<p>
The manipulation of individual, mobile quanta is a key goal of quantum communication; to achieve this, nonlinear phenomena in open systems can play a critical role. We show theoretically that a variety of strong quantum nonlinear phenomena occur in a completely open one-dimensional waveguide coupled to an N-type four-level system (4LS). We focus on photon blockade and the creation of single photon states in the absence of a cavity. Many-body bound states appear due to the strong photon-photon correlation mediated by the 4LS. These bound states cause photon blockade which can generate a sub-Poissonian single photon source.
