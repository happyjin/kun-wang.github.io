**1.    Spacetime structures of continuous time quantum walks**  
Oliver Muelken, Alexander Blumen  
Phys. Rev. E 71, 036128 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502004  
<blockquote>
<p>
The propagation by continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on one-dimensional lattices shows structures in the transition probabilities between different sites reminiscent of quantum carpets. For a system with periodic boundary conditions, we calculate the transition probabilities for a CTQW by diagonalizing the transfer matrix and by a Bloch function ansatz. Remarkably, the results obtained for the Bloch function ansatz can be related to results from (discrete) generalized coined quantum walks. Furthermore, we show that here the first revival time turns out to be larger than for quantum carpets.

**2.    The Effects of Symmetries on Quantum Fidelity Decay**  
Yaakov S. Weinstein, C. Stephen Hellberg  
Phys. Rev. E 71, 035203(R), 2005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502012  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the effect of a system's symmetries on fidelity decay behavior. Chaos-like exponential fidelity decay behavior occurs in non-chaotic systems when the system possesses symmetries and the applied perturbation is not tied to a classical parameter. Similar systems without symmetries exhibit faster-than-exponential decay under the same type of perturbation. This counter-intuitive result, that extra symmetries cause the system to behave in a chaotic fashion, may have important ramifications for quantum error correction.

**3.    Demonstration of Quantum Error Correction using Linear Optics**  
T.B. Pittman, B.C Jacobs, J.D. Franson  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 052332 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502042  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a laboratory demonstration of a quantum error correction procedure that can correct intrinsic measurement errors in linear-optics quantum gates. The procedure involves a two-qubit encoding and fast feed-forward-controlled single-qubit operations. In our demonstration the qubits were represented by the polarization states of two single-photons from a parametric down-conversion source, and the real-time feed-forward control was implemented using an electro-optic device triggered by the output of single-photon detectors.

**4.    An information-theoretic security proof for QKD protocols**  
R. Renner, N. Gisin, B. Kraus  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 012332 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502064  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. It is based on direct information-theoretic arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze the BB84, the six-state, and the B92 protocol with one-way error correction and privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more robust against noise in the quantum channel.

**5.    NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality**  
Scott Aaronson  
ACM SIGACT News, March 2005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502072  
<blockquote>
<p>
Can NP-complete problems be solved efficiently in the physical universe? I survey proposals including soap bubbles, protein folding, quantum computing, quantum advice, quantum adiabatic algorithms, quantum-mechanical nonlinearities, hidden variables, relativistic time dilation, analog computing, Malament-Hogarth spacetimes, quantum gravity, closed timelike curves, and "anthropic computing." The section on soap bubbles even includes some "experimental" results. While I do not believe that any of the proposals will let us solve NP-complete problems efficiently, I argue that by studying them, we can learn something not only about computation but also about physics.

**6.    Quantum kinetic energy densities: An operational approach**  
J.G. Muga, D. Seidel, G.C. Hegerfeldt  
J. Chem. Phys. 122, 154106 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502079  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and investigate a procedure to measure, at least in principle, a positive quantum version of the local kinetic energy density. This procedure is based, under certain idealized limits, on the detection rate of photons emitted by moving atoms which are excited by a localized laser beam. The same type of experiment, but in different limits, can also provide other non positive-definite versions of the kinetic energy density. A connection with quantum arrival time distributions is discussed.

**7.    Supersymmetric Models for Fermions on a Lattice**  
Nevena Ilieva, Heide Narnhofer, Walter Thirring  
Fortsch.Phys.54:124-138,2006  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502100  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the large-N behaviour of simple examples of supersymmetric interactions for fermions on a lattice. Witten's supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the BCS model appear just as two different aspects of one and the same model. For the BCS model, supersymmetry is only respected in a coherent superposition of Bogoliubov states. In this coherent superposition mesoscopic observables show better stability properties than in a Bogoliubov state.

**8.    Thresholds for Linear Optics Quantum Computing with Photon Loss at the Detectors**  
Marcus Silva, Martin Roetteler, Christof Zalka  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 032307 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502101  
<blockquote>
<p>
We calculate the error threshold for the linear optics quantum computing proposal by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [Nature 409, pp. 46--52 (2001)] under an error model where photon detectors have efficiency <100% but all other components -- such as single photon sources, beam splitters and phase shifters -- are perfect and introduce no errors. We make use of the fact that the error model induced by the lossy hardware is that of an erasure channel, i.e., the error locations are always known. Using a method based on a Markov chain description of the error correction procedure, our calculations show that, with the 7 qubit CSS quantum code, the gate error threshold for fault tolerant quantum computation is bounded below by a value between 1.78% and 11.5% depending on the construction of the entangling gates.

**9.    Quantum Indeterminism and First Passage Random Walks in Hilbert Space**  
Fariel Shafee  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502111  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new model for a measurement of a characteristic of a microscopic quantum state by a large system that selects stochastically the different eigenstates with appropriate quantum weights. Unlike previous works which formulate a modified Schr\"odinger equation or an explicit modified Hamiltonian, or more complicated mechanisms for reduction and decoherence to introduce transition to classical stochasticity, we propose the novel use of couplings to the environment, and random walks in the product Hilbert space of the combined system, with first passage stopping rules, which seem intuitively simple, as quantum weights and related stochasticity is a commonality that must be preserved under the widest range of applications, independent of the measured quantity and the specific properties of the measuring device.

**10.    High Fidelity Single Qubit Operations using Pulsed EPR**  
John J. L. Morton, Alexei M. Tyryshkin, Arzhang Ardavan, Kyriakos Porfyrakis, S. A. Lyon, G. Andrew D. Briggs  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 200501 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502119  
<blockquote>
<p>
Systematic errors in spin rotation operations using simple RF pulses place severe limitations on the usefulness of the pulsed magnetic resonance methods in quantum computing applications. In particular, the fidelity of quantum logic operations performed on electron spin qubits falls well below the threshold for the application of quantum algorithms. Using three independent techniques, we demonstrate the use of composite pulses to improve this fidelity by several orders of magnitude. The observed high-fidelity operations are limited by pulse phase errors, but nevertheless fall within the limits required for the application of quantum error correction.

**11.    Observation of the skin-depth effect on the Casimir force between metallic surfaces**  
Mariangela Lisanti, Davide Iannuzzi, Federico Capasso  
Proc. Nat. Ac. Sci. USA 102, 11989 (2005) (with minor corrections)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502123  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have performed comparative measurements of the Casimir force between a metallic plate and a transparent sphere coated with metallic films of different thicknesses. We have observed that, if the thickness of the coating is less than the skin-depth of the electromagnetic modes that mostly contribute to the interaction, the force is significantly smaller than that measured with a thick bulk-like film. Our results provide the first direct evidence of the skin-depth effect on the Casimir force between metallic surfaces.

**12.    More On Grover's Algorithm**  
Ken Loo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502137  
<blockquote>
<p>
The goals of this paper are to show the following. First, Grover's algorithm can be viewed as a digital approximation to the analog quantum algorithm proposed in "An Analog Analogue of a Digital Quantum Computation", by E. Farhi and S. Gutmann, Phys.Rev. A 57, 2403 - 2406 (1998), quant-ph/9612026. We will call the above analog algorithm the Grover-Farhi-Gutmann or GFG algorithm. Second, the propagator of the GFG algorithm can be written as a sum-over-paths formula and given a sum-over-path interpretation, i.e., a Feynman path sum/integral. We will use nonstandard analysis to do this. Third, in the semi-classical limit $\hbar\to 0$, both the Grover and the GFG algorithms (viewed in the setting of the approximation in this paper) must run instantaneously. Finally, we will end the paper with an open question. In "Semiclassical Shor's Algorithm", by P. Giorda, et al, Phys. Rev.A 70, 032303 (2004), quant-ph/0303037, the authors proposed building semi-classical quantum computers to run Shor's algorithm because the success probability of Shor's algorithm does not change much in the semi-classical limit. We ask the open questions: In the semi-classical limit, does Shor's algorithm have to run instantaneously?

**13.    Experimental Synchronization of Independent Entangled Photon Sources**  
Tao Yang, Qiang Zhang, Teng-Yun Chen, Shan Lu, Juan Yin, Jian-Wei Pan, Zhi-Yi Wei, Jing-Rong Tian, Jie Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502146  
<blockquote>
<p>
Realistic linear quantum information processing necessitates the ability to synchronously generate entangled photon pairs either at the same or at distant locations. Here, we report the experimental realization of synchronized generation of independent entangled photon pairs. The quality of synchronization is confirmed by observing a violation of Bell's inequality with 3.2 standard deviations in an entanglement swapping experiment. The techniques developed in our experiment will be of great importance for future linear optical realization of quantum repeaters and quantum computation.

**14.    From perfect to fractal transmission in spin chains**  
Gabriele De Chiara, Davide Rossini, Simone Montangero, Rosario Fazio  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 012323 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502148  
<blockquote>
<p>
Perfect state transfer is possible in modulated spin chains, imperfections however are likely to corrupt the state transfer. We study the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder both in the exchange couplings between the spins and in the local magnetic field. The degradation of the fidelity can be suitably expressed, as a function of the level of imperfection and the length of the chain, in a scaling form. In addition the time signal of fidelity becomes fractal. We further characterize the state transfer by analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian of the spin chain.

**15.    An application of neutrix calculus to quantum field theory**  
Y. Jack Ng, H. van Dam  
Int.J.Mod.Phys. A21 (2006) 297-312  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0502163  
<blockquote>
<p>
Neutrices are additive groups of negligible functions that do not contain any constants except 0. Their calculus was developed by van der Corput and Hadamard in connection with asymptotic series and divergent integrals. We apply neutrix calculus to quantum field theory, obtaining finite renormalizations in the loop calculations. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we recover all the usual physically observable results. One possible advantage of the neutrix framework is that effective field theories can be accommodated. Quantum gravity theories appear to be more manageable.
