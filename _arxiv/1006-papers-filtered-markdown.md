**1.    All-optical generation of states for "Encoding a qubit in an oscillator"**  
Hilma Vasconcelos, Liliana Sanz, Scott Glancy  
Opt. Lett. 35, 3261-3263 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0009  
<blockquote>
<p>
Both discrete and continuous systems can be used to encode quantum information. Most quantum computation schemes propose encoding qubits in two-level systems, such as a two-level atom or an electron spin. Others exploit the use of an infinite-dimensional system, such as a harmonic oscillator. In "Encoding a qubit in an oscillator" [Phys. Rev. A 64 012310 (2001)], Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP) combined these approaches when they proposed a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme in which a qubit is encoded in the continuous position and momentum degrees of freedom of an oscillator. One advantage of this scheme is that it can be performed by use of relatively simple linear optical devices, squeezing, and homodyne detection. However, we lack a practical method to prepare the initial GKP states. Here we propose the generation of an approximate GKP state by using superpositions of optical coherent states (sometimes called "Schr\"odinger cat states"), squeezing, linear optical devices, and homodyne detection.

**2.    Theory of cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric downconversion**  
Yasser Jeronimo-Moreno, Saul Rodriguez-Benavides, Alfred B. U'Ren  
Laser Physics, 2010, Vol. 20, No. 5, pp. 1221-1233  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0050  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we study photon pairs generated in a nonlinear cavity, composed of a nonlinear crystal surrounded by mirrors, by the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion. We analyze two different regimes: singly-resonant cavities where the signal and idler modes are resonant, and doubly-resonant cavities where the pump mode is also resonant. We present analytic expressions for the joint spectral amplitude in these two cases, and study the reduction in emission bandwidth as the cavity coefficient finesse is increased. We also study the enhancement of the source brightness resulting from the presence of the cavity.

**3.    Mutually Unbiased Bases and Semi-definite Programming**  
Stephen Brierley, Stefan Weigert  
J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 254 012008 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0093  
<blockquote>
<p>
A complex Hilbert space of dimension six supports at least three but not more than seven mutually unbiased bases. Two computer-aided analytical methods to tighten these bounds are reviewed, based on a discretization of parameter space and on Grobner bases. A third algorithmic approach is presented: the non-existence of more than three mutually unbiased bases in composite dimensions can be decided by a global optimization method known as semidefinite programming. The method is used to confirm that the spectral matrix cannot be part of a complete set of seven mutually unbiased bases in dimension six.

**4.    Generalized self-testing and the security of the 6-state protocol**  
Matthew McKague, Michele Mosca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0150  
<blockquote>
<p>
Self-tested quantum information processing provides a means for doing useful information processing with untrusted quantum apparatus. Previous work was limited to performing computations and protocols in real Hilbert spaces, which is not a serious obstacle if one is only interested in final measurement statistics being correct (for example, getting the correct factors of a large number after running Shor's factoring algorithm). This limitation was shown by McKague et al. to be fundamental, since there is no way to experimentally distinguish any quantum experiment from a special simulation using states and operators with only real coefficients. In this paper, we show that one can still do a meaningful self-test of quantum apparatus with complex amplitudes. In particular, we define a family of simulations of quantum experiments, based on complex conjugation, with two interesting properties. First, we are able to define a self-test which may be passed only by states and operators that are equivalent to simulations within the family. This extends work of Mayers and Yao and Magniez et al. in self-testing of quantum apparatus, and includes a complex measurement. Second, any of the simulations in the family may be used to implement a secure 6-state QKD protocol, which was previously not known to be implementable in a self-tested framework.

**5.    Quantum frequency downconversion experiment**  
Hiroki Takesue  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 013833 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0364

<p>
We report the first quantum frequency downconversion experiment. Using the difference frequency generation process in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide, we successfully observed the phase-preserved frequency downconversion of a coherent pulse train with an average photon number per pulse of $<$1, from the 0.7-$\mu$m visible wavelength band to the 1.3-$\mu$m telecom band. We expect this technology to become an important tool for flexible photonic quantum networking, including the realization of quantum repeater systems over optical fiber using atom-photon entanglement sources for the visible wavelength bands.

**6.    The quantum state vector in phase space and Gabor's windowed Fourier transform**  
A.J. Bracken, P. Watson  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 (2010) 395304  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0370  
<blockquote>
<p>
Representations of quantum state vectors by complex phase space amplitudes, complementing the description of the density operator by the Wigner function, have been defined by applying the Weyl-Wigner transform to dyadic operators, linear in the state vector and anti-linear in a fixed `window state vector'. Here aspects of this construction are explored, with emphasis on the connection with Gabor's `windowed Fourier transform'. The amplitudes that arise for simple quantum states from various choices of window are presented as illustrations. Generalized Bargmann representations of the state vector appear as special cases, associated with Gaussian windows. For every choice of window, amplitudes lie in a corresponding linear subspace of square-integrable functions on phase space. A generalized Born interpretation of amplitudes is described, with both the Wigner function and a generalized Husimi function appearing as quantities linear in an amplitude and anti-linear in its complex conjugate. Schr\"odinger's time-dependent and time-independent equations are represented on phase space amplitudes, and their solutions described in simple cases.

**7.    Analytical model of non-Markovian decoherence in donor-based charge quantum bits**  
F Lastra, S Reyes, S Wallentowitz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0515  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop an analytical model for describing the dynamics of a donor-based charge quantum bit (qubit). As a result, the quantum decoherence of the qubit is analytically obtained and shown to reveal non-Markovian features: The decoherence rate varies with time and even attains negative values, generating a non-exponential decay of the electronic coherence and a later recoherence. The resulting coherence time is inversely proportional to the temperature, thus leading to low decoherence below a material dependent characteristic temperature.

**9.    A Family of Norms With Applications In Quantum Information Theory II**  
Nathaniel Johnston, David W. Kribs  
Quantum Inf. Comput. 11 1 & 2 (2011), 104-123  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0898  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of computing the family of operator norms recently introduced in arXiv:0909.3907. We develop a family of semidefinite programs that can be used to exactly compute them in small dimensions and bound them in general. Some theoretical consequences follow from the duality theory of semidefinite programming, including a new constructive proof that there are non-positive partial transpose Werner states that are r-undistillable for arbitrary r. Several examples are considered via a MATLAB implementation of the semidefinite program, including the case of Werner states and randomly generated states via the Bures measure, and approximate distributions of the norms are provided. We extend these norms to arbitrary convex mapping cones and explore their implications with positive partial transpose states.

**10.    A family of loss-tolerant quantum coin flipping protocols**  
N. Aharon, S. Massar, J. Silman  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 052307 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1121  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a family of loss-tolerant quantum strong coin flipping protocols; each protocol differing in the number of qubits employed. For a single qubit we obtain a bias of 0.4, reproducing the result of Berl\'{i}n et al. [Phys. Rev. A 80, 062321 (2009)], while for two qubits we obtain a bias of 0.3975. Numerical evidence based on semi-definite programming indicates that the bias continues to decrease as the number of qubits is increased but at a rapidly decreasing rate.

Davide Bondoni  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1137  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper has been withdrawn by the author. In this short paper I introduce a concept of possibility in order to vindicate Everett's Theory of many worlds. The main idea is that there is only one world: the real. After the wave-collapse, we have again only one world, but many possible worlds which have a different grade of possibility. In this sense 'possible' exclude the 'reality', opposing a long modal tradition.

**13.    Coined quantum walks on percolation graphs**  
Godfrey Leung, Paul Knott, Joe Bailey, Viv Kendon  
New J. Phys. 12 123018 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1283  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks, both discrete (coined) and continuous time, form the basis of several quantum algorithms and have been used to model processes such as transport in spin chains and quantum chemistry. The enhanced spreading and mixing properties of quantum walks compared with their classical counterparts have been well-studied on regular structures and also shown to be sensitive to defects and imperfections in the lattice. As a simple example of a disordered system, we consider percolation lattices, in which edges or sites are randomly missing, interrupting the progress of the quantum walk. We use numerical simulation to study the properties of coined quantum walks on these percolation lattices in one and two dimensions. In one dimension (the line) we introduce a simple notion of quantum tunneling and determine how this affects the properties of the quantum walk as it spreads. On two-dimensional percolation lattices, we show how the spreading rate varies from linear in the number of steps down to zero, as the percolation probability decreases to the critical point. This provides an example of fractional scaling in quantum walk dynamics.

**14.    Average Entanglement for Markovian Quantum Trajectories**  
Sylvain Vogelsberger, Dominique Spehner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1317  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the evolution of the entanglement of noninteracting qubits coupled to reservoirs under monitoring of the reservoirs by means of continuous measurements. We calculate the average of the concurrence of the qubits wavefunction over all quantum trajectories. For two qubits coupled to independent baths subjected to local measurements, this average decays exponentially with a rate depending on the measurement scheme only. This contrasts with the known disappearance of entanglement after a finite time for the density matrix in the absence of measurements. For two qubits coupled to a common bath, the mean concurrence can vanish at discrete times. Our analysis applies to arbitrary quantum jump or quantum state diffusion dynamics in the Markov limit. We discuss the best measurement schemes to protect entanglement in specific examples.

**15.    Generation and detection of NOON states in superconducting circuits**  
Seth T. Merkel, Frank K. Wilhelm  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1336  
<blockquote>
<p>
NOON states, states between two modes of light of the form $|N,0\rangle+e^{i\phi}|0,N\rangle$ allow for super-resolution interformetry. We show how NOON states can be efficiently produced in circuit quntum electrodynamics using superconducting phase qubits and resonators. We propose a protocol where only one interaction between the two modes is required, creating all the necessary entanglement at the start of the procedure. This protocol makes active use of the first three states of the phase qubits. Additionally, we show how to efficiently verify the success of such an experiment, even for large NOON states, using randomly sampled measurements and semidefinite programming techniques.

**16.    Simulating spin-charge separation with light**  
Dimitris G. Angelakis, Mingxia Huo, Elica Kyoseva, Leong Chuan kwek  
Phys. Rev Lett. 106, 153601 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1644  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we show that stationary light-matter excitations generated inside a hollow one-dimensional waveguide filled with atoms, can be made to generate a photonic two-component Lieb Liniger model. We explain how to prepare and drive the atomic system to a strongly interacting regime where spin-charge separation could be possible. We then proceed by explaining how to measure the corresponding effective spin and charge densities and velocities through standard optical methods based in measuring dynamically the emitted photon intensities or by analyzing the photon spectrum. The relevant interactions exhibit the necessary tunability both to generate and efficiently observe spin charge separation with current technology.

**17.    Frozen discord in non-Markovian dephasing channels**  
L. Mazzola, J. Piilo, S. Maniscalco  
International Journal of Quantum Information Vol. 9, No. 3 (2011) 981-991  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1805  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in a system of two qubits under local colored-noise dephasing channels. The time evolution of a single qubit interacting with its own environment is described by a memory kernel non-Markovian master equation. The memory effects of the non-Markovian reservoirs introduce new features in the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations compared to the white noise Markovian case. Depending on the geometry of the initial state, the system can exhibit frozen discord and multiple sudden transitions between classical and quantum decoherence [L. Mazzola, J. Piilo and S. Maniscalco, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 (2010) 200401]. We provide a geometric interpretation of those phenomena in terms of the distance of the state under investigation to its closest classical state in the Hilbert space of the system.

**18.    Hybrid Quantum System of a Nanofiber Mode Coupled to Two Chains of Optically Trapped Atoms**  
Hashem Zoubi, Helmut Ritsch  
New Journal of Physics 12, 103014 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1971  
<blockquote>
<p>
A tapered optical nanofiber simultaneously used to trap and optically interface of cold atoms through evanescent fields constitutes a new and well controllable hybrid quantum system. The atoms are trapped in two parallel 1D optical lattices generated by suitable far blue and red detuned evanescent field modes very close to opposite sides of the nanofiber surface. Collective electronic excitations (excitons) of each of the optical lattices are resonantly coupled to the second lattice forming symmetric and antisymmetric common excitons. In contrast to the inverse cube dependence of the individual atomic dipole-dipole interaction, we analytically find an exponentially decaying coupling strength with distance between the lattices. The resulting symmetric (bright) excitons strongly interact with the resonant nanofiber photons to form fiber polaritons, which can be observed through linear optical spectra. For large enough wave vectors the polariton decay rate to free space is strongly reduced, which should render this system ideal for the realization of long range quantum communication between atomic ensembles.

**19.    Disordered quantum walk-induced localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate**  
C. M. Chandrashekar  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 022320 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1978  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an approach to induce localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional lattice under the influence of unitary quantum walk evolution using disordered quantum coin operation. We introduce a discrete-time quantum walk model in which the interference effect is modified to diffuse or strongly localize the probability distribution of the particle by assigning a different set of coin parameters picked randomly for each step of the walk, respectively. Spatial localization of the particle/state is explained by comparing the variance of the probability distribution of the quantum walk in position space using disordered coin operation to that of the walk using an identical coin operation for each step. Due to the high degree of control over quantum coin operation and most of the system parameters, ultracold atoms in an optical lattice offer opportunities to implement a disordered quantum walk that is unitary and induces localization. Here we present a scheme to use a Bose-Einstein condensate that can be evolved to the superposition of its internal states in an optical lattice and control the dynamics of atoms to observe localization. This approach can be adopted to any other physical system in which controlled disordered quantum walk can be implemented.

**20.    Controllability of Quantum Walks on Graphs**  
Francesca Albertini, Domenico D'Alessandro  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2405  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider discrete time quantum walks on graphs with coin focusing on the decentralized model, where the coin operation is allowed to change with the vertex of the graph. When the coin operations can be modified at every time step, these systems can be looked at as control systems and techniques of geometric control theory can be applied. In particular, the set of states that one can achieve can be described by studying controllability. Extending previous results, we give a characterization of the set of reachable states in terms of an appropriate Lie algebra. We then prove general results and criteria relating controllability to the algebraic and topological properties of the walk. As a consequence of these results, we prove that if the degree of the underlying graph is larger than $\frac{N}{2}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, the quantum walk is always completely controllable, i.e., it is possible to having it to evolve according to an arbitrary unitary evolution. Another result is that controllability for decentralized models only depends on the graph and not on the particular quantum walk defined on it. We also provide explicit algorithms for control and quantify the number of steps needed for an arbitrary state transfer. The results of the paper are of interest in quantum information theory where quantum walks are used and analyzed in the development of quantum algorithms.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report the observation of photon generation in a microwave cavity with a time-dependent boundary condition. Our system is a microfabricated quarter-wave coplanar waveguide cavity. The electrical length of the cavity is varied using the tunable inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device. It is measured in the quantum regime, where the temperature is significantly less than the resonance frequency (~ 5 GHz). When the length is modulated at approximately twice the static resonance frequency, spontaneous oscillations of the cavity field are observed. Time-resolved measurements of the dynamical state of the cavity show multiple stable states. The behavior is well described by theory. Connections to the dynamical Casimir effect are discussed.

**22.    Which graph states are useful for quantum information processing?**  
Mehdi Mhalla, Mio Murao, Simon Perdrix, Masato Someya, Peter S. Turner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2616  
<blockquote>
<p>
Graph states are an elegant and powerful quantum resource for measurement based quantum computation (MBQC). They are also used for many quantum protocols (error correction, secret sharing, etc.). The main focus of this paper is to provide a structural characterisation of the graph states that can be used for quantum information processing. The existence of a gflow (generalized flow) is known to be a requirement for open graphs (graph, input set and output set) to perform uniformly and strongly deterministic computations. We weaken the gflow conditions to define two new more general kinds of MBQC: uniform equiprobability and constant probability. These classes can be useful from a cryptographic and information point of view because even though we cannot do a deterministic computation in general we can preserve the information and transfer it perfectly from the inputs to the outputs. We derive simple graph characterisations for these classes and prove that the deterministic and uniform equiprobability classes collapse when the cardinalities of inputs and outputs are the same. We also prove the reversibility of gflow in that case. The new graphical characterisations allow us to go from open graphs to graphs in general and to consider this question: given a graph with no inputs or outputs fixed, which vertices can be chosen as input and output for quantum information processing? We present a characterisation of the sets of possible inputs and ouputs for the equiprobability class, which is also valid for deterministic computations with inputs and ouputs of the same cardinality.

**23.    Non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals**  
Meng-Hsiu Wu, Chan U Lei, Wei-Min Zhang, Heng-Na Xiong  
Opt. Express, 18, 18407 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2624  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, the non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity coupled to a waveguide in photonic crystals is studied based on Fano-type tight binding model. Using the exact master equation, we solve analytically and numerically the temporal evolution of the cavity coherent state and the associated physical observables. A critical transition is revealed when the coupling increase between the cavity and the waveguide. In particular, the cavity field becomes dissipationless when the coupling strength goes beyond a critical value, as a manifestation of strong non-Markovian memory effect. The result also indicates that the cavity can maintain in a coherent state with arbitrary small number of photons when it strongly couples to the waveguide at very low temperature. These properties can be measured experimentally through the photon current flowing over the waveguide in photonic crystals.

New J. Phys. 13 023003 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3829  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the major advances needed to realize all-optical information processing of light is the ability to delay or coherently store and retrieve optical information in a rapidly tunable manner. In the classical domain, this optical buffering is expected to be a key ingredient to managing the flow of information over complex optical networks. Such a system also has profound implications for quantum information processing, serving as a long-term memory that can store the full quantum information contained in an optical pulse. Here we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical waveguide coupled to an optomechanical crystal array, where light in the waveguide can be dynamically and coherently transferred into long-lived mechanical vibrations of the array. Under realistic conditions, this system is capable of achieving large bandwidths and storage/delay times in a compact, on-chip platform.

**27.    De-quantisation of the Quantum Fourier Transform**  
Alastair A. Abbott  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3989  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) plays an important role in many known quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for prime factorisation. In this paper we show that the QFT algorithm can, on a restricted set of input states, be de-quantised into a classical algorithm which is both more efficient and simpler than the quantum algorithm. By working directly with the algorithm instead of the circuit, we develop a simple classical version of the quantum basis-state algorithm. We formulate conditions for a separable state to remain separable after the QFT is performed, and use these conditions to extend the de-quantised algorithm to work on all such states without loss of efficiency. Our technique highlights the linearity of quantum mechanics as the fundamental feature accounting for the difference between quantum and de-quantised algorithms, and that it is this linearity which makes the QFT such a useful tool in quantum computation.

**28.    New Developments in Quantum Algorithms**  
Andris Ambainis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4014  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this survey, we describe two recent developments in quantum algorithms. The first new development is a quantum algorithm for evaluating a Boolean formula consisting of AND and OR gates of size N in time O(\sqrt{N}). This provides quantum speedups for any problem that can be expressed via Boolean formulas. This result can be also extended to span problems, a generalization of Boolean formulas. This provides an optimal quantum algorithm for any Boolean function in the black-box query model. The second new development is a quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. In contrast with traditional algorithms that run in time O(N^{2.37...}) where N is the size of the system, the quantum algorithm runs in time O(\log^c N). It outputs a quantum state describing the solution of the system.

J. Math. Phys. 51 (2010) 112104  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4527  
<blockquote>
<p>
The "correlated-projection technique" has been successfully applied to derive a large class of highly non Markovian dynamics, the so called non Markovian generalized Lindblad type equations or Lindblad rate equations. In this article, general unravellings are presented for these equations, described in terms of jump-diffusion stochastic differential equations for wave functions. We show also that the proposed unravelling can be interpreted in terms of measurements continuous in time, but with some conceptual restrictions. The main point in the measurement interpretation is that the structure itself of the underlying mathematical theory poses restrictions on what can be considered as observable and what is not; such restrictions can be seen as the effect of some kind of superselection rule. Finally, we develop a concrete example and we discuss possible effects on the heterodyne spectrum of a two-level system due to a structured thermal-like bath with memory.

Mixing properties of discrete-time quantum walks on two-dimensional grids with torus-like boundary conditions are analyzed, focusing on their connection to the complexity of the corresponding abstract search algorithm.

The limiting distribution and mixing time of a quantum walk with a coin operator modified as in the abstract search algorithm are obtained numerically. On the basis of these results, the relation between the mixing time of the modified walk and the running time of the corresponding abstract search algorithm is discussed.

The proposed method is sufficiently general to suggest that the conclusions made here are widely applicable to a large class of settings involving interacting chains subject to a weak interaction with an environment.

<p>
Quantum information science addresses how uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement can enhance communication, information processing and precision measurement. Photons are appealing for their low noise, light-speed transmission and ease of manipulation using conventional optical components. However, the lack of highly efficient optical Kerr nonlinearities at single photon level was a major obstacle. In a breakthrough, Knill, Laflamme and Milburn (KLM) showed that such an efficient nonlinearity can be achieved using only linear optical elements, auxiliary photons, and measurement. They proposed a heralded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for scalable quantum computation using a photonic quantum circuit to combine two such nonlinear elements. Here we experimentally demonstrate a KLM CNOT gate. We developed a stable architecture to realize the required four-photon network of nested multiple interferometers based on a displaced-Sagnac interferometer and several partially polarizing beamsplitters. This result confirms the first step in the KLM `recipe' for all-optical quantum computation, and should be useful for on-demand entanglement generation and purification. Optical quantum circuits combining giant optical nonlinearities may find wide applications across telecommunications and sensing.

<p>
Quantum walks of correlated particles offer the possibility to study large-scale quantum interference, simulate biological, chemical and physical systems, and a route to universal quantum computation. Here we demonstrate quantum walks of two identical photons in an array of 21 continuously evanescently-coupled waveguides in a SiOxNy chip. We observe quantum correlations, violating a classical limit by 76 standard deviations, and find that they depend critically on the input state of the quantum walk. These results open the way to a powerful approach to quantum walks using correlated particles to encode information in an exponentially larger state space.

<p>
We review the progress and main challenges in implementing large-scale quantum computing by optical control of electron spins in quantum dots (QDs). Relevant systems include self-assembled QDs of III-V or II-VI compound semiconductors (such as InGaAs and CdSe), monolayer fluctuation QDs in compound semiconductor quantum wells, and impurity centers in solids such as P-donors in silicon and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. The decoherence of the electron spin qubits is discussed and various schemes for countering the decoherence problem are reviewed. We put forward designs of local nodes consisting of a few qubits which can be individually addressed and controlled. Remotely separated local nodes are connected by photonic structures (microcavities and waveguides) to form a large-scale distributed quantum system or a quantum network. The operation of the quantum network consists of optical control of a single electron spin, coupling of two spins in a local nodes, optically controlled quantum interfacing between stationary spin qubits in QDs and flying photon qubits in waveguides, rapid initialization of spin qubits, and qubit-specific single-shot non-demolition quantum measurement. The rapid qubit initialization may be realized by selectively enhancing certain entropy dumping channels via phonon or photon baths. The single-shot quantum measurement may be in-situ implemented through the integrated photonic network. The relevance of quantum non-demolition measurement to large-scale quantum computation is discussed. To illustrate the feasibility and demand, the resources are estimated for the benchmark problem of factorizing 15 with Shor's algorithm.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have emerged as an interesting alternative to the usual circuit model for quantum computing. While still universal for quantum computing, the quantum walk model has very different physical requirements, which lends itself more naturally to some physical implementations, such as linear optics. Numerous authors have considered walks with one or two walkers, on one dimensional graphs, and several experimental demonstrations have been performed. In this paper we discuss generalizing the model of discrete time quantum walks to the case of an arbitrary number of walkers acting on arbitrary graph structures. We present a formalism which allows for analysis of such situations, and several example scenarios for how our techniques can be applied. We consider the most important features of quantum walks -- measurement, distinguishability, characterization, and the distinction between classical and quantum interference. We also discuss the potential for physical implementation in the context of linear optics, which is of relevance to present day experiments.

<p>
We report the realization of a bright ultrafast two-mode squeezer based on type II parametric downconversion (PDC) in periodically poled $\mathrm{KTiOPO_4}$ (PP-KTP) waveguides. It produces a pulsed two-mode squeezed vacuum state: a photon-number entangled pair of truly single-mode pulses or, in terms of continuous variables quantum optics, a pulsed, single mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state in the telecom regime. We prove the single mode character of our source by measuring its $g^{(2)}$ correlation function and demonstrate a mean photon number of up to 2.5 per pulse, equivalent to 11dB of two-mode squeezing.

<blockquote>
<p>
This paper has been withdrawn by the author. In this short paper I present a new approach to the problem of measurement, based on the difference between language (reality) and meta-language (meta-reality). This way, it will be shown as the measurement is a meta-sentence on a real event. It is no longer necessary to split up the world into subject and object with a shifty boundary, but starting with an holistic event (the phenomenon) in which everything is entangled and make meta-assertion on this. This possible way out stops von Neumann's chain and explains the real meaning of the concept of measurement.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a basic high-level structures used for developing quantum programming languages. The presented structures are commonly used in many existing quantum programming languages and we use quantum pseudo-code based on QCL quantum programming language to describe them. We also present the implementation of introduced structures in GNU Octave language for scientific computing. Procedures used in the implementation are available as a package quantum-octave, providing a library of functions, which facilitates the simulation of quantum computing. This package allows also to incorporate high-level programming concepts into the simulation in GNU Octave and Matlab. As such it connects features unique for high-level quantum programming languages, with the full palette of efficient computational routines commonly available in modern scientific computing systems. To present the major features of the described package we provide the implementation of selected quantum algorithms. We also show how quantum errors can be taken into account during the simulation of quantum algorithms using quantum-octave package. This is possible thanks to the ability to operate on density matrices.

<p>
We conjecture that thermalization following a quantum quench in a strongly correlated quantum system is closely connected to many-body delocalization in the space of quasi-particles. This scenario is tested in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain with different types of integrability-breaking terms. We first quantify the deviations from integrability by analyzing the level spacing statistics and the inverse participation ratio of the system's eigenstates. We then focus on thermalization, by studying the dynamics after a sudden quench of the anisotropy parameter. Our numerical simulations clearly support the conjecture, as long as the integrability-breaking term acts homogeneously on the quasiparticle space, in such a way as to induce ergodicity over all the relevant Hilbert space.

<blockquote>
<p>
The cumulant representation of the Fourier path integral method is examined to determine the asymptotic convergence characteristics of the imaginary-time density matrix with respect to the number of path variables $N$ included. It is proved that when the cumulant expansion is truncated at order $p$, the asymptotic convergence rate of the density matrix behaves like $N^{-(2p+1)}$. The complex algebra associated with the proof is simplified by introducing a diagrammatic representation of the contributing terms along with an associated linked-cluster theorem. The cumulant terms at each order are expanded in a series such that the the asymptotic convergence rate is maintained without the need to calculate the full cumulant at order $p$. Using this truncated expansion of each cumulant at order $p$, the numerical cost in developing Fourier path integral expressions having convergence order $N^{-(2p+1)}$ is shown to be approximately linear in the number of required potential energy evaluations making the method promising for actual numerical implementation.

<p>
Quantum annealing is a generic algorithm using quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for the solution of an optimization problem. The present paper first reviews the fundamentals of quantum annealing and then reports on preliminary results for an alternative method. The review part includes the relationship of quantum annealing with classical simulated annealing. We next propose a novel quantum algorithm which might be available for hard optimization problems by using a classical-quantum mapping as well as the Jarzynski equality introduced in nonequilibrium statistical physics.

**43.    Shapiro Steps as a Direct Probe of $\pm s$-wave Symmetry in Multi-gap Superconducting Josephson Junctions**

Phys. Rev. B 82, 140509(R) (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2184  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically study the Shapiro steps in a hetero Josephson junction made of a single-gap superconductor and a two-gap one. We find that an anomalous DC Josephson current is induced by tuning the frequency of an applied microwave to the Josephson-Leggett mode frequency, which creates an extra step structure in the $I$-$V$ characteristics besides the conventional Shapiro steps. The step heights at the resonance voltages exhibit an alternate structure of a large and small value reflecting the gap symmetry of the two-gap superconductor. In the $\pm s-wave case in which the two gaps have opposite signs in the two-gap superconductor the steps with odd index are enhanced, whereas in the s-wave case the ones with even index have larger values. The existence of the fractional Shapiro steps is also predicted.
