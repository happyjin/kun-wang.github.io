**1.    Sampling generalized cat states with linear optics is probably hard**  
Peter P. Rohde, Keith R. Motes, Paul Knott, Joseph Fitzsimons, William Munro, Jonathan P. Dowling  
Phys. Rev. A 91, 012342 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0297  
<blockquote>
<p>
Boson-sampling has been presented as a simplified model for linear optical quantum computing. In the boson-sampling model, Fock states are passed through a linear optics network and sampled via number-resolved photodetection. It has been shown that this sampling problem likely cannot be efficiently classically simulated. This raises the question as to whether there are other quantum states of light for which the equivalent sampling problem is also computationally hard. We present evidence, without using a full complexity proof, that a very broad class of quantum states of light --- arbitrary superpositions of two or more coherent states --- when evolved via passive linear optics and sampled with number-resolved photodetection, likely implements a classically hard sampling problem.

**2.    Two-particle fermionic quantum walks on a cycle graph**  
Alexey A. Melnikov, Leonid E. Fedichkin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0420  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we study quantum walks of electrons on a graph. This graph is composed of Si quantum dots arranged in a circle. Electrons can tunnel between neighbouring dots and interact via Coulomb interaction. We show that this mutual repulsion leads to entanglement. Fermionic entanglement dynamics is evaluated by several measures. Current detectors are considered in the paper as a noisy environment. We show that depending on the noise parameters fermionic entanglement can be annihilated, preserved, created for a certain time or re-created after annihilation.

**3.    Stochastic Schr?dinger Equations for Markovian and non-Markovian cases**  
I. Semina, V. Semin, F. Petruccione, A. Barchielli  
Open Sys. Inf. Dyn. 21 (2014) 1440008  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0644  
<blockquote>
<p>
Firstly, the Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equations are presented, together with their connections with the theory of measurements in continuous time. Moreover, the stochastic evolution equations are translated into a simulation algorithm, which is illustrated by two concrete examples - the damped harmonic oscillator and a two-level atom with homodyne photodetection. Then, we consider how to introduce memory effects in the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation via coloured noise. Specifically, the approach by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is illustrated and a simulation for the non-Markovian process proposed. Finally, an analytical approximation technique is tested with the help of the stochastic simulation in a model of a dissipative qubit.

**4.    Essential lack of security proof in quantum key distribution**  
Horace P. Yuen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0842  
<blockquote>
<p>
All the currently available unconditional security proofs on quantum key distribution, in particular for the BB84 protocol and its variants including continuous-variable ones, are invalid or incomplete at many points. In this paper we discuss some of the main known problems, particularly those on operational security guarantee and error correction. Most basic are the points that there is no security parameter in such protocols and it is not the case the generated key is perfect with probability $\geq 1-\epsilon$ under the trace distance criterion $d\leq\epsilon$, which is widely claimed in the technical and popular literature. The many serious security consequences of this error about the QKD generated key would be explained, including practical ramification on achievable security levels. It will be shown how the error correction problem alone may already defy rigorous quantitative analysis. Various other problems would be touched upon. It is pointed out that rigorous security guarantee of much more efficient quantum cryptosystems may be obtained by abandoning the disturbance-information tradeoff principle and utilizing instead the known KCQ (keyed communication in quantum noise) principle in conjunction with a new DBM (decoy bits method) principle that will be detailed elsewhere.

**5.    Properties of subentropy**  
Nilanjana Datta, Tony Dorlas, Richard Jozsa, Fabio Benatti  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1312  
<blockquote>
<p>
Subentropy is an entropy-like quantity that arises in quantum information theory; for example, it provides a tight lower bound on the accessible information for pure state ensembles, dual to the von Neumann entropy upper bound in Holevo's theorem. Here we establish a series of properties of subentropy, paralleling the well-developed analogous theory for von Neumann entropy. Further, we show that subentropy is a lower bound for min-entropy. We introduce a notion of conditional subentropy and show that it can be used to provide an upper bound for the guessing probability of any classical-quantum state of two qubits; we conjecture that the bound applies also in higher dimensions. Finally we give an operational interpretation of subentropy within classical information theory.

**6.    Non-Markovian effect on remote state preparation**  
Zhen-Yu Xu, Chen Liu, Shunlong Luo, Shiqun Zhu  
Annals of Physics 356, 29 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1784  
<blockquote>
<p>
Memory effect of non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems is often believed to be beneficial for quantum information processing. In this work, we employ an experimentally controllable two-photon open system, with one photon experiencing a dephasing environment and the other being free from noise, to show that non-Markovian effect may also have a negative impact on quantum tasks such as remote state preparation: For a certain period of controlled time interval, stronger non-Markovian effect yields lower fidelity of remote state preparation, as opposed to the common wisdom that more information leads to better performance. As a comparison, a positive non-Markovian effect on the RSP fidelity with another typical non-Markovian noise is analyzed. Consequently, the observed dual character of non-Markovian effect will be of great importance in the field of open systems engineering.

**7.    Unified Dynamics of Electrons and Photons via Zitterbewegung and Spin-Orbit Interaction**  
C.C. Leary, Karl H. Smith  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1995  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that when an electron or photon propagates in a cylindrically symmetric waveguide, it experiences both a zitterbewegung effect and a spin-orbit interaction leading to identical propagation dynamics for both particles. Applying a unified perturbative approach to both particles simultaneously, we find that to first-order in perturbation theory their Hamiltonians each contain identical Darwin (zitterbewegung) and spin-orbit terms, resulting in the unification of their dynamics. The presence of the zitterbewegung effect may be interpreted physically as the delocalization of the electron on the scale of its Compton wavelength, or the delocalization of the photon on the scale of its wavelength in the waveguide. The presence of the spin-orbit interaction leads to the prediction of several rotational effects: the spatial or time evolution of either particle's spin/polarization vector is controlled by the sign of its orbital angular momentum quantum number, or conversely, its spatial wave function is controlled by its spin angular momentum.

**8.    Closed hierarchy of correlations in Markovian open quantum systems**  
Bojan ?unkovi?  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2278  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the Lindblad master equation in the space of operators and provide simple criteria for closeness of the hierarchy of equations for correlations. We separately consider the time evolution of closed and open systems and show that open systems satisfying the closeness conditions are not necessary of Gaussian type. In addition, we show that dissipation can induce the closeness of the hierarchy of correlations in interacting quantum systems. As an example we study an interacting optomechanical model, the Fermi-Hubbard model, and the Rabi model, all coupled to a fine-tuned Markovian environment and obtain exact analytic expressions for the time evolution of two-point correlations.

**9.    Quantum Computing with black-box Subroutines**  
Jayne Thompson, Mile Gu, Kavan Modi, Vlatko Vedral  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2927  
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern programming relies on our ability to treat preprogrammed functions as black boxes - we can invoke them as subroutines without knowing their physical implementation. Here we show it is generally impossible to execute an unknown quantum subroutine. This, as a special case, forbids applying black-box subroutines conditioned on an ancillary qubit. We explore how this limits many quantum algorithms - forcing their circuit implementation to be individually tailored to specific inputs and inducing failure if these inputs are not known in advance. We present a method to avoid this situation for certain computational problems. We apply this method to enhance existing quantum factoring algorithms; reducing their complexity, and the extent to which they need to be tailored to factor specific numbers. Thus, we highlight a natural property of classical information that fails in the advent of quantum logic; and simultaneously demonstrate how to mitigate its effects in practical situations.

**10.    Increasing sensing resolution with error correction**  
Gilad Arrad, Yuval Vinkler, Dorit Aharonov, Alex Retzker  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 150801 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3016  
<blockquote>
<p>
The signal to noise ratio of quantum sensing protocols scales with the square root of the coherence time. Thus, increasing this time is a key goal in the field. Dynamical decoupling has proven to be efficient in prolonging the coherence times for the benefit of quantum sensing. However, dynamical decoupling can only push the sensitivity up to a certain limit. In this work we present a new approach to increasing the coherence time further through error correction which can improve the efficiency of quantum sensing beyond the fundamental limits of current state of the art methods.

**11.    Finding structural anomalies in star graphs: A general approach**  
Seth Cottrell, Mark Hillery  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 030501 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3147  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a general theory for a quantum-walk search on a star graph. A star graph has N edges each of which is attached to a central vertex. A graph G is attached to one of these edges, and we would like to find out to which edge it is attached. This is done by means of a quantum walk, a quantum version of a random walk. This walk contains O(\sqrt{N}) steps, which represents a speedup over a classical search, which would require O(N) steps. The overall graph, star plus G, is divided into two parts, and we find that for a quantum speedup to occur, the eigenvalues associated with these two parts in the N goes to infinity limit must be the same. Our theory tells us how the initial state of the walk should be chosen, and how many steps the walk must make in order to find G.

**12.    Quantum Error Correction for Metrology**  
Eric M. Kessler, Igor Lovchinsky, Alexander O. Sushkov, Mikhail D. Lukin  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 150802 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3260  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze a new approach based on quantum error correction (QEC) to improve quantum metrology in the presence of noise. We identify the conditions under which QEC allows one to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in quantum-limited measurements, and we demonstrate that it enables, in certain situations, Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. We discuss specific applications to nanoscale sensing using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond in which QEC can significantly improve the measurement sensitivity and bandwidth under realistic experimental conditions.

**13.    Decoding non-Abelian topological quantum memories**  
James R. Wootton, Jan Burri, Sofyan Iblisdir, Daniel Loss  
Phys. Rev. X 4, 011051 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3846  
<blockquote>
<p>
The possibility of quantum computation using non-Abelian anyons has been considered for over a decade. However the question of how to obtain and process information about what errors have occurred in order to negate their effects has not yet been considered. This is in stark contrast with quantum computation proposals for Abelian anyons, for which decoding algorithms have been tailor-made for many topological error-correcting codes and error models. Here we address this issue by considering the properties of non-Abelian error correction in general. We also choose a specific anyon model and error model to probe the problem in more detail. The anyon model is the charge submodel of $D(S_3)$. This shares many properties with important models such as the Fibonacci anyons, making our method applicable in general. The error model is a straightforward generalization of those used in the case of Abelian anyons for initial benchmarking of error correction methods. It is found that error correction is possible under a threshold value of $7 \%$ for the total probability of an error on each physical spin. This is remarkably comparable with the thresholds for Abelian models.

**14.    Universal State Transfer on Graphs**  
Stephen Cameron, Shannon Fehrenbach, Leah Granger, Oliver Hennigh, Sunrose Shrestha, Christino Tamon  
Linear Algebra and Its Applications 455:115-142, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3885  
<blockquote>
<p>
A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph $G$ is given by the unitary matrix $U(t) = \exp(-itA)$, where $A$ is the Hermitian adjacency matrix of $G$. We say $G$ has pretty good state transfer between vertices $a$ and $b$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is a time $t$, where the $(a,b)$-entry of $U(t)$ satisfies $|U(t)_{a,b}| \ge 1-\epsilon$. This notion was introduced by Godsil (2011). The state transfer is perfect if the above holds for $\epsilon = 0$. In this work, we study a natural extension of this notion called universal state transfer. Here, state transfer exists between every pair of vertices of the graph. We prove the following results about graphs with this stronger property: (1) Graphs with universal state transfer have distinct eigenvalues and flat eigenbasis (where each eigenvector has entries which are equal in magnitude). (2) The switching automorphism group of a graph with universal state transfer is abelian and its order divides the size of the graph. Moreover, if the state transfer is perfect, then the switching automorphism group is cyclic. (3) There is a family of prime-length cycles with complex weights which has universal pretty good state transfer. This provides a concrete example of an infinite family of graphs with the universal property. (4) There exists a class of graphs with real symmetric adjacency matrices which has universal pretty good state transfer. In contrast, Kay (2011) proved that no graph with real-valued adjacency matrix can have universal perfect state transfer. We also provide a spectral characterization of universal perfect state transfer graphs that are switching equivalent to circulants.

**15.    Hybrid Atom--Photon Quantum Gate in a Superconducting Microwave Resonator**  
J. D. Pritchard, J. A. Isaacs, M. A. Beck, R. McDermott, M. Saffman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3910  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel hybrid quantum gate between an atom and a microwave photon in a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity by exploiting the strong resonant microwave coupling between adjacent Rydberg states. Using experimentally achievable parameters gate fidelities $> 0.99$ are possible on sub-$\mu$s timescales for waveguide temperatures below 40 mK. This provides a mechanism for generating entanglement between two disparate quantum systems and represents an important step in the creation of a hybrid quantum interface applicable for both quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

**16.    Quantum Algorithms for Finding Constant-sized Sub-hypergraphs**  
Fran?ois Le Gall, Harumichi Nishimura, Seiichiro Tani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4127  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a general framework to construct quantum algorithms that detect if a $3$-uniform hypergraph given as input contains a sub-hypergraph isomorphic to a prespecified constant-sized hypergraph. This framework is based on the concept of nested quantum walks recently proposed by Jeffery, Kothari and Magniez [SODA'13], and extends the methodology designed by Lee, Magniez and Santha [SODA'13] for similar problems over graphs. As applications, we obtain a quantum algorithm for finding a $4$-clique in a $3$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with query complexity $O(n^{1.883})$, and a quantum algorithm for determining if a ternary operator over a set of size $n$ is associative with query complexity $O(n^{2.113})$.

**17.    Scalable Implementation of Boson Sampling with Trapped Ions**  
Chao Shen, Zhen Zhang, Luming Duan  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 050504 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4860  
<blockquote>
<p>
Boson sampling solves a classically intractable problem by sampling from a probability distribution given by matrix permanents. We propose a scalable implementation of Boson sampling using local transverse phonon modes of trapped ions to encode the Bosons. The proposed scheme allows deterministic preparation and high-efficiency readout of the Bosons in the Fock states and universal mode mixing. With the state-of-the-art trapped ion technology, it is feasible to realize Boson sampling with tens of Bosons by this scheme, which would outperform the most powerful classical computers and constitute an effective disproof of the famous extended Church-Turing thesis.

<p>
A method to realize effective magnetic fields for photons in square lattices of coupled optical waveguides or resonators is suggested, which is inspired by an optical analogue of photon-assisted tunneling of atom optics. It is shown that an artificial magnetic field can be achieved by application of an index gradient and periodic lumped phase shifts or modulation of the propagation constants/resonances, without the need to modulate the coupling strength.

**19.    Convective and absolute PT symmetry breaking in tight-binding lattices**  
Stefano Longhi  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 052102 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5004  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the onset of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices with spatially-extended loss/gain regions in presence of an advective term. Similarly to the instability properties of hydrodynamic open flows, it is shown that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking can be either absolute or convective. In the former case, an initially-localized wave packet shows a secular growth with time at any given spatial position, whereas in the latter case the growth is observed in a reference frame moving at some drift velocity while decay occurs at any fixed spatial position. In the convective unstable regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is restored when the spatial region of gain/loss in the lattice is limited (rather than extended). We consider specifically a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele tight binding lattice model, and show the existence of a transition from absolute to convective symmetry breaking when the advective term is large enough. An extension of the analysis to ac-dc-driven lattices is also presented, and an optical implementation of the non-Hermitian Rice-Mele model is suggested, which is based on light transport in an array of evanescently-coupled optical waveguides with a periodically-bent axis and alternating regions of optical gain and loss.

**20.    Parallelism of the measures in non-Markovian environments**  
Abolfathiyar Masoud, Faizi Esfandyar, Entekhabi Sina  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5060  
<blockquote>
<p>
There are various measures to compute correlation in various conditions, but none of them can be used publicly, because each of them has abnormality in their calculations or behaviors. These abnormalities do not depend on genus of environments. Therefore, in this work we will show correlation diversity of evolution that is computed by each measure for two oscillators with their non-Markovian stochastic reservoir. We will see that while the situation is the same for all of them, they will have symmetrical plots. In more expressive words, process of the measures has a kind of parallelism when angular momentum and time are increasing. In the other hand, increase of quantum correlation under the non-Markovian drive is observable in all of studied measures. Also, in all of them (quantum discord's measures and entanglement's measures)recently occurrences are done.

<p>
We describe an efficient quantum algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in semigroups using Shor's algorithms for period finding and discrete log as subroutines. Thus proposed cryptosystems based on the presumed hardness of discrete logarithms in semigroups are insecure against quantum attacks. In contrast, we show that some generalizations of the discrete log problem are hard in semigroups despite being easy in groups. We relate a shifted version of the discrete log problem in semigroups to the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, and we show that the constructive membership problem with respect to $k \ge 2$ generators in a black-box abelian semigroup of order $N$ requires $\tilde \Theta(N^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ quantum queries.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6241  
<blockquote>
<p>
A lattice of trapped atoms strongly coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide is investigated in exploiting the concept of polariton as the system natural eigenstate. We apply a bosonization procedure, which was presented separately by P. W. Anderson and V. M. Agranovich, to transform excitation spin-half operators into interacting bosons, and which shown here to confirm the hard-core boson model. We derive polariton-polariton kinematic interactions and study them by solving the scattering problem. In using the excitation-photon detuning as a control parameter, we examine the regime in which polaritons behave as weakly interacting photons, and propose the system for realizing superfluidity of photons. We implement the kinematic interaction as a mechanism for nonlinear optical processes that provide an observation tool for the system properties, e.g. the interaction strength produces a blue shift in pump-probe experiments.

We use complex contour integral techniques to study the entropy H and subentropy Q as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials, revealing a series of striking properties.

It then follows that exp (-H) and exp(-Q) are Laplace transforms of infinitely divisible probability distributions.

**26.    Generation of Universal Linear Optics by Any Beamsplitter**  
Adam Bouland, Scott Aaronson  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 062316 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6718  
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1994, Reck et al. showed how to realize any unitary transformation on a single photon using a product of beamsplitters and phaseshifters. Here we show that any single beamsplitter that nontrivially mixes two modes, also densely generates the set of unitary transformations (or orthogonal transformations, in the real case) on the single-photon subspace with m>=3 modes. (We prove the same result for any two-mode real optical gate, and for any two-mode optical gate combined with a generic phaseshifter.) Experimentally, this means that one does not need tunable beamsplitters or phaseshifters for universality: any nontrivial beamsplitter is universal for linear optics. Theoretically, it means that one cannot produce "intermediate" models of linear optical computation (analogous to the Clifford group for qubits) by restricting the allowed beamsplitters and phaseshifters: there is a dichotomy; one either gets a trivial set or else a universal set. No similar classification theorem for gates acting on qubits is currently known. We leave open the problem of classifying optical gates that act on three or more modes.

Phys. Rev. A 89, 013805 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7286  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a single-photon router using a single atom with an inversion center coupled to quantum multichannels made of coupled-resonator waveguides. We show that the spontaneous emission of the atom can direct single photons from one quantum channel into another. The on-demand classical field perfectly switches-off the single-photon routing due to the quantum interference in the atomic amplitudes of optical transitions. Total reflections in the incident channel are due to the photonic bound state in the continuum. Two virtual channels, named as scatter-free and controllable channels, are found, which are coherent superpositions of quantum channels. Any incident photon in the scatter-free channel is totally transmitted. The propagating states of the controllable channel are orthogonal to those of the scatter-free channel. Single photons in the controllable channel can be perfectly reflected or transmitted by the atom.

**29.    Logic Synthesis for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers**  
N. Cody Jones  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7290  
<blockquote>
<p>
Efficient constructions for quantum logic are essential since quantum computation is experimentally challenging. This thesis develops quantum logic synthesis as a paradigm for reducing the resource overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing. The model for error correction considered here is the surface code. After developing the theory behind general logic synthesis, the resource costs of magic-state distillation for the $T = \exp(i \pi (I-Z)/8)$ gate are quantitatively analyzed. The resource costs for a relatively new protocol distilling multi-qubit Fourier states are calculated for the first time. Four different constructions of the fault-tolerant Toffoli gate, including two which incorporate error detection, are analyzed and compared. The techniques of logic synthesis reduce the cost of fault-tolerant quantum computation by one to two orders of magnitude, depending on which benchmark is used. Using resource analysis for $T$ gates and Toffoli gates, several proposals for constructing arbitrary quantum gates are compared, including "Clifford+$T$" sequences, $V$-basis sequences, phase kickback, and programmable ancilla rotations. The application of arbitrary gates to quantum algorithms for simulating chemistry is discussed as well. Finally, the thesis examines the techniques which lead to efficient constructions of quantum logic, and these observations point to even broader applications of logic synthesis.

**31.    Quantum walk with a general coin: Exact solution and asymptotic properties**  
Miquel Montero  
Quantum Information Processing, March 2015, Volume 14, Issue 3, pp 839-866  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7486  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we present closed-form expressions for the wave function that governs the evolution of the discrete-time quantum walk on a line when the coin operator is arbitrary. The formulas were derived assuming that the walker can either remain put in the place or proceed in a fixed direction but never move backward, although they can be easily modified to describe the case in which the particle can travel in both directions. We use these expressions to explore the properties of magnitudes associated to the process, as the probability mass function or the probability current, even though we also consider the asymptotic behavior of the exact solution. Within this approximation, we will estimate upper and lower bounds, consider the origins of an emerging approximate symmetry, and deduce the general form of the stationary probability density of the relative location of the walker.

<blockquote>
<p>
Based on the group structure of a unitary Lie algebra, a scheme is provided to systematically and exhaustively generate quantum error correction codes, including the additive and nonadditive codes. The syndromes in the process of error-correction distinguished by different orthogonal vector subspaces, the coset subspaces. Moreover, the generated codes can be classified into four types with respect to the spinors in the unitary Lie algebra and a chosen initial quantum state.

**33.    Fault-Tolerant Measurement-Based Quantum Computing with Continuous-Variable Cluster States**  
Nicolas C. Menicucci  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 120504 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7596  
<blockquote>
<p>
A long-standing open question about Gaussian continuous-variable cluster states is whether they enable fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation. The answer is yes. Initial squeezing in the cluster above a threshold value of 20.5 dB ensures that errors from finite squeezing acting on encoded qubits are below the fault-tolerance threshold of known qubit-based error-correcting codes. By concatenating with one of these codes and using ancilla-based error correction, fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation of theoretically indefinite length is possible with finitely squeezed cluster states.

**34.    Fourier transform of fermionic systems and the spectral tensor network**

Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 010401 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7605  
<blockquote>
<p>
Leveraging the decomposability of the fast Fourier transform, I propose a new class of tensor network that is efficiently contractible and able to represent many-body systems with local entanglement that is greater than the area law. Translationally invariant systems of free fermions in arbitrary dimensions as well as 1D systems solved by the Jordan-Wigner transformation are shown to be exactly represented in this class. Further, it is proposed that these tensor networks be used as generic structures to variationally describe more complicated systems, such as interacting fermions. This class shares some similarities with Evenbly & Vidal's branching MERA, but with some important differences and greatly reduced computational demands.

**35.    Quantum random walks on congested lattices**  
Keith R. Motes, Alexei Gilchrist, Peter P. Rohde  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8161  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum random walks on congested lattices and contrast them to classical random walks. Congestion is modelled with lattices that contain static defects which reverse the walker's direction. We implement a dephasing process after each step which allows us to smoothly interpolate between classical and quantum random walkers as well as study the effect of dephasing on the quantum walk. Our key results show that a quantum walker escapes a finite boundary dramatically faster than a classical walker and that this advantage remains in the presence of heavily congested lattices. Also, we observe that a quantum walker is extremely sensitive to our model of dephasing.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8208  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how two-dimensional waveguide arrays can be used to probe the effect of on-site interaction on Anderson localization of two interacting bosons in one dimension. It is shown that classical light and linear elements are sufficient to experimentally probe the interplay between interaction and disorder in this setting. For experimental relevance, we evaluate the participation ratio and the intensity correlation function as measures of localization for two types of disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal), for two types of interaction (repulsive and attractive), and for a variety of initial input states. Employing a commonly used set of initial states, we show that the effect of interaction on Anderson localization is strongly dependent on the type of disorder and initial conditions, but is independent of whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive. We then analyze a certain type of entangled input state where the type of interaction is relevant and discuss how it can be naturally implemented in waveguide arrays. We conclude by laying out the details of the two-dimensional photonic lattice implementation including the required parameter regime.

Phys. Rev. A 89, 015803 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1400  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a procedure to classically simulate the Majorana equation in 1+1 dimensions via two one-dimensional photonic crystals. We use a decomposition of the Majorana equation into two Dirac equations and propose a novel approach that uses a bi-chromatic refractive index distribution and nearest neighbor couplings of the type found in Glauber-Fock lattices. This allows us to escape the restriction of staying near the Brillouin zone imposed by the classical simulation of Dirac dynamics with bi-chromatic lattices. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate the evolution of Gaussian wavepackets under the Majorana/Dirac equation with light impinging only into the first waveguide of our bi-chromatic-Glauber-Fock lattice.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4757  
<blockquote>
<p>
By analysing the sensitivity to a twist in the boundary conditions of the stationary state attained by a many-body system long after a quantum quench, we extend the concepts of the helicity modulus and the stiffness to non-equilibrium situations. Using these generalised quantities, we characterise the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of hard-core bosons quenched to/from superfluid/insulating phases and show that qualitative new features emerge as compared to the equilibrium case. Our predictions can be tested in experiments with cold bosonic atoms confined in toroidal traps and subject to artificial gauge fields.

<p>
Zak phase, i.e. the Berry phase acquired during an adiabatic motion of a Bloch particle across the Brillouin zone, provides a measure of the topological invariant of Bloch bands in one-dimensional crystalline potentials. Here a photonic structure, based on engineered lattices of evanescently-coupled optical waveguides, is proposed to detect Zak phase difference of photons undergoing Bloch oscillations in topologically distinct Bloch bands of dimerized superlattices.

We present a classical analog of quantum optical deformed oscillators in arrays of waveguides. The normal modes of these one-dimensional photonic crystals are given in terms of Jacobi polynomials. We show that it is possible to attack the problem via factorization by exploiting the quantum optical analogy. This allows us to provide an unbroken supersymmetric partner of the proposed Jacobi lattices. Thanks to the underlying SU(1,1) group symmetry of the lattices, we present the analytic propagators and impulse functions for these one-dimensional photonic crystals.

**42.    Ground state uniqueness of the twelve site RVB spin-liquid parent Hamiltonian on the kagome lattice**

Phys. Rev. B 89, 035123 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8000  
<blockquote>
<p>
Anderson's idea of a (short-ranged) resonating valence bond (RVB) spin liquid has been the first ever proposal of what we now call a topologically ordered phase. Since then, a wealth of exactly solvable lattice models have been constructed that have topologically ordered ground states. For a long time, however, it has been difficult to realize Anderson's original vision in such solvable models, according to which the ground state has an unbroken SU(2) spin rotational symmetry and is dominated by fluctuation of singlet bonds. The kagome lattice is the simplest lattice geometry for which parent Hamiltonians stabilizing a prototypical spin-1/2 short-ranged RVB wave function has been constructed and strong evidence has been given that this state belongs to a topological phase. The uniqueness of the desired RVB-type ground states has, however, not been rigorously proven for the simplest possible such Hamiltonian, which acts on 12 spins at a time. Rather, this uniqueness has been demonstrated for a longer ranged (19-site) variant of this Hamiltonian by Schuch et al., via making contact with powerful results for projected entangled-pair states. In this paper, we extend this result to the 12-site Hamiltonian. Our result is based on numerical studies on finite clusters, for which we demonstrate a "ground state intersection property" with implications for arbitrary system size. We also review the relations between various constructions schemes for RVB parent-Hamiltonians found in the literature.
