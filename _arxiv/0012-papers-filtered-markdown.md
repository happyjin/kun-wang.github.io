**1.    Complete parameterization, and invariance, of diffusive quantum trajectories for Markovian open systems**  
H.M. Wiseman, L. Diosi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012016  
<blockquote>
<p>
The state matrix $\rho$ for an open quantum system with Markovian evolution obeys a master equation. The master equation evolution can be unraveled into stochastic nonlinear trajectories for a pure state $P$, such that on average $P$ reproduces $\rho$. Here we give for the first time a complete parameterization of all diffusive unravelings (in which $P$ evolves continuously but non-differentiably in time). We give an explicit measurement theory interpretation for these quantum trajectories, in terms of monitoring the system's environment. We also introduce new classes of diffusive unravelings that are invariant under the linear operator transformations under which the master equation is invariant. We illustrate these invariant unravelings by numerical simulations. Finally, we discuss generalized gauge transformations as a method of connecting apparently disparate descriptions of the same trajectories by stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, and their invariance properties.

**2.    Feasible Entanglement Purification for Quantum Communication**  
Jian-Wei Pan, Christoph Simon, Caslav Brukner, Anton Zeilinger  
Nature 410, 1067-1070 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012026  
<blockquote>
<p>
The distribution of entangled states between distant locations will be essential for the future large scale realization of quantum communication schemes such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Because of the unavoidable noise in the quantum communication channel, the entanglement between two particles is more and more degraded the further they propagate. Entanglement purification is thus essential to distill highly entangled states from less entangled ones. Existing general purification protocols are based on the quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) or similar quantum logic operations, which are very difficult to implement experimentally. Present realizations of CNOT gates are much too imperfect to be useful for long-distance quantum communication. Here we present a feasible scheme for the entanglement purification of general mixed entangled states, which does not require any CNOT operations, but only simple linear optical elements. Since the perfection of such elements is very high, the local operations necessary for purification can be performed with the required precision. Our procedure is within the reach of current technology and should significantly simplify the implementation of long-distance quantum communication.

**3.    New high-efficiency source of photon pairs for engineering quantum entanglement**  
Kaoru Sanaka, Karin Kawahara, Takahiro Kuga  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012028  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have constructed an efficient source of photon pairs using a waveguide-type nonlinear device and performed a two-photon interference experiment with an unbalanced Michelson interferometer. Parametric down-converted photons from the nonlinear device are detected by two detectors located at the output ports of the interferometer. Because the interferometer is constructed with two optical paths of different length, photons from the shorter path arrive at the detector earlier than those from the longer path. We find that the difference of arrival time and the time window of the coincidence counter are important parameters which determine the boundary between the classical and quantum regime. When the time window of the coincidence counter is smaller than the arrival time difference, fringes of high visibility (80$\pm$ 10%) were observed. This result is only explained by quantum theory and is clear evidence for quantum entanglement of the interferometer's optical paths.

**4.    Realization of quantum process tomography in NMR**  
Andrew M. Childs, Isaac L. Chuang, Debbie W. Leung  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 012314 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012032  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum process tomography is a procedure by which the unknown dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be fully experimentally characterized. We demonstrate explicitly how this procedure can be implemented with a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer. This allows us to measure the fidelity of a controlled-not logic gate and to experimentally investigate the error model for our computer. Based on the latter analysis, we test an important assumption underlying nearly all models of quantum error correction, the independence of errors on different qubits.

**5.    Highly efficient photon-pair source using a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate Waveguide**  
S.Tanzilli, H.de Riedmatten, W.Tittel, H. Zbinden, P. Baldi, M. de Micheli, D.B. Ostrowsky, N. Gisin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012053  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a new kind of correlated photon-pair source based on a waveguide integrated on a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate substrate. Using a pump laser of a few micro-Watts at 657 nm, we generate degenerate photon-pairs at 1314 nm. Detecting about 1500 coincidences per second, we can infer a conversion rate of 10-6 pairs per pump photon, which is four orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with previous bulk sources. These results are very promising for the realization of sources for quantum communication and quantum metrology experiments requiring a high signal-to-noise ratio or working with more than one photon-pair at a time.

**6.    General Forms of a N-fold Supersymmetric Family**  
Hideaki Aoyama, Masatoshi Sato, Toshiaki Tanaka  
Phys.Lett. B503 (2001) 423-429  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012065  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report general forms of one family of the N-fold supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. The N-fold supersymmetry is characterized by the supercharges which are N-th order in differential operators. The family reported here is defined as a particular form of the supercharges and is referred to as ``type A''. We show that a quartic and a periodic potentials, which were previously found to be N-fold supersymmetric by the authors, are realized as special cases of this type A family.

**7.    Security of Quantum Key Distribution with Entangled Photons Against Individual Attacks**  
Edo Waks, Assaf Zeevi, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012078  
<blockquote>
<p>
Security of the Ekert protocol is proven against individual attacks where an eavesdropper is allowed to share any density matrix with the two communicating parties. The density matrix spans all of the photon number states of both receivers, as well as a probe state of arbitrary dimensionality belonging to the eavesdropper. Using this general eavesdropping strategy, we show that the Shannon information on the final key, after error correction and privacy amplification, can be made exponentially small. This is done by finding a bound on the eavesdropper's average collision probability. We find that the average collision probability for the Ekert protocol is the same as that of the BB84 protocol for single photons, indicating that there is no analog in the Ekert protocol to photon splitting attacks. We then compare the communication rate of both protocols as a function of distance, and show that the Ekert protocol has potential for much longer communication distances, up to 170km, in the presence of realistic detector dark counts and channel loss. Finally, we propose a slightly more complicated scheme based on entanglement swapping that can lead to even longer distances of communication. The limiting factor in this new scheme is the fiber loss, which imposes very slow communication rates at longer distances.

**8.    Quantum factoring, discrete logarithms and the hidden subgroup problem**  
Richard Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012084  
<blockquote>
<p>
Amongst the most remarkable successes of quantum computation are Shor's efficient quantum algorithms for the computational tasks of integer factorisation and the evaluation of discrete logarithms. In this article we review the essential ingredients of these algorithms and draw out the unifying generalization of the so-called abelian hidden subgroup problem. This involves an unexpectedly harmonious alignment of the formalism of quantum physics with the elegant mathematical theory of group representations and fourier transforms on finite groups. Finally we consider the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem mentioning some open questions where future quantum algorithms may be expected to have a substantial impact.

**9.    Quantum Walks On Graphs**  
Dorit Aharonov, Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, Umesh Vazirani  
Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation (STOC'01), July 2001, p. 50-59  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012090  
<blockquote>
<p>
We set the ground for a theory of quantum walks on graphs- the generalization of random walks on finite graphs to the quantum world. Such quantum walks do not converge to any stationary distribution, as they are unitary and reversible. However, by suitably relaxing the definition, we can obtain a measure of how fast the quantum walk spreads or how confined the quantum walk stays in a small neighborhood. We give definitions of mixing time, filling time, dispersion time. We show that in all these measures, the quantum walk on the cycle is almost quadratically faster then its classical correspondent. On the other hand, we give a lower bound on the possible speed up by quantum walks for general graphs, showing that quantum walks can be at most polynomially faster than their classical counterparts.

**10.    Finding cliques by quantum adiabatic evolution**  
Andrew M. Childs, Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, Sam Gutmann  
Quantum Information and Computation 2, 181 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012104  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum adiabatic evolution provides a general technique for the solution of combinatorial search problems on quantum computers. We present the results of a numerical study of a particular application of quantum adiabatic evolution, the problem of finding the largest clique in a random graph. An n-vertex random graph has each edge included with probability 1/2, and a clique is a completely connected subgraph. There is no known classical algorithm that finds the largest clique in a random graph with high probability and runs in a time polynomial in n. For the small graphs we are able to investigate (n <= 18), the quantum algorithm appears to require only a quadratic run time.

**11.    Resonantly enhanced nonlinear optics in semiconductor quantum wells: An application to sensitive infrared detection**  
S. F. Yelin, P. R. Hemmer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012136  
<blockquote>
<p>
A novel class of coherent nonlinear optical phenomena, involving induced transparency in quantum wells, is considered in the context of a particular application to sensitive long-wavelength infrared detection. It is shown that the strongest decoherence mechanisms can be suppressed or mitigated, resulting in substantial enhancement of nonlinear optical effects in semiconductor quantum wells.

**12.    A Generalization of Grover's Algorithm**  
Luigi Accardi, Ruben Sabbadini  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012143  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a unitary operator can amplify a pre-assigned component relative to a particular basis of a generic vector at the expense of the other components. This leads to a general method which allows, given a vector and one of its components we want to amplify, to choose the optimal unitary operator which realizes that goal. Grover's quantum algorithm is shown to be a particular case of our general method. However the general structure of the unitary we find is remarkably similar to that of Grover's one: a sign flip of one component combined with a reflection with respect to a vector. In Grover's case this vector is fixed; in our case it depends on a parameter and this allows optimization.

**13.    Towards Robust Quantum Computation**  
Debbie W. Leung  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012017  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation is a subject of much theoretical promise, but has not been realized in large scale, despite the discovery of fault-tolerant procedures to overcome decoherence. Part of the reason is that the theoretically modest requirements still present daunting experimental challenges. The goal of this Dissertation is to reduce various resources required for robust quantum computation, focusing on quantum error correcting codes and solution NMR quantum computation. A variety of techniques have been developed, including high rate quantum codes for amplitude damping, relaxed criteria for quantum error correction, systematic construction of fault-tolerant gates, recipes for quantum process tomography, techniques in bulk thermal state computation, and efficient decoupling techniques to implement selective coupled logic gates. A detailed experimental study of a quantum error correcting code in NMR is also presented. The Dissertation clarifies and extends results previously reported in quant-ph/9610043, quant-ph/9704002, quant-ph/9811068, quant-ph/9904100, quant-ph/9906112, quant-ph/0002039. Additionally, a procedure for quantum process tomography using maximally entangled states, and a review on NMR quantum computation are included.
