**1.    Multipartite electronic entanglement purification with charge detection**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Fu-Guo Deng, Gui-Lu Long  
Phys. Lett. A 375 (2011) 396-400  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0057  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a multipartite entanglement purification scheme in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for electrons based on their spins and their charges. This scheme works for purification with two steps, i.e., bit-flipping error correction and phase-error flip error correction. By repeating these two steps, the parties in quantum communication can get some high-fidelity multipartite entangled electronic systems.

**2.    Bound states in open coupled asymmetrical waveguides and quantum wires**  
Paolo Amore, Martin Rodriguez, Cesar A. Terrero-Escalante  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0754  
<blockquote>
<p>
The behavior of bound states in asymmetric cross, T and L shaped configurations is considered. Because of the symmetries of the wavefunctions, the analysis can be reduced to the case of an electron localized at the intersection of two orthogonal crossed wires of different width. Numerical calculations show that the fundamental mode of this system remains bound for the widths that we have been able to study directly; moreover, the extrapolation of the results obtained for finite widths suggests that this state remains bound even when the width of one arm becomes infinitesimal. We provide a qualitative argument which explains this behavior and that can be generalized to the lowest energy states in each symmetry class. In the case of odd-odd states of the cross we find that the lowest mode is bounded when the width of the two arms is the same and stays bound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths; in the case of the even-odd states we find that the lowest mode is unbound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths. Our qualitative arguments suggest that the bound state survives as the width of the vertical arm becomes infinitesimal.

**3.    Gaussian geometric discord**  
Gerardo Adesso, Davide Girolami  
Int. J. Quant. Inf. 9, 1773 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2532  
<blockquote>
<p>
We extend the geometric measure of quantum discord, introduced and computed for two-qubit states in [B. Dakic, C. Brukner, and V. Vedral, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 190502 (2010)], to quantify non-classical correlations in composite Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. We lay the formalism for the evaluation of a Gaussian geometric discord in two-mode Gaussian states, and present explicit formulas for the class of two-mode squeezed thermal states. In such a case, under physical constraints of bounded mean energy, geometric discord is shown to admit upper and lower bounds for a fixed value of the conventional (entropic) quantum discord. We finally discuss alternative geometric approaches to quantify Gaussian quadrature correlations.

**4.    Schemes of transmission of classical information via quantum channels with many senders: discrete and continuous variables cases**  
L. Czekaj, J. K. Korbicz, R. W. Chhajlany, P. Horodecki  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 012316 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2594  
<blockquote>
<p>
Superadditivity effects in the classical capacity of discrete multi-access channels (MACs) and continuous variable (CV) Gaussian MACs are analysed. New examples of the manifestation of superadditivity in the discrete case are provided including, in particular, a channel which is fully symmetric with respect to all senders. Furthermore, we consider a class of channels for which {\it input entanglement across more than two copies of the channels is necessary} to saturate the asymptotic rate of transmission from one of the senders to the receiver. The 5-input entanglement of Shor error correction codewords surpass the capacity attainable by using arbitrary two-input entanglement for these channels. In the CV case, we consider the properties of the two channels (a beam-splitter channel and a "non-demolition" XP gate channel) analyzed in [Czekaj {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 82}, 020302 (R) (2010)] in greater detail and also consider the sensitivity of capacity superadditivity effects to thermal noise. We observe that the estimates of amount of two-mode squeezing required to achieve capacity superadditivity are more optimistic than previously reported.

**5.    Microscopic theory of energy dissipation and decoherence in solid-state systems: A reformulation of the conventional Markov limit**  
Michele Pepe, David Taj, Rita Claudia Iotti, Fausto Rossi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3623  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present and discuss a general density-matrix description of energy-dissipation and decoherence phenomena in open quantum systems, able to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the conventional Markov approximation. In particular, the proposed alternative adiabatic scheme does not threaten positivity at any time. The key idea of our approach rests in the temporal symmetrization and coarse graining of the scattering term in the Liouville-von Neumann equation, before applying the reduction procedure over the environment degrees of freedom. The resulting dynamics is genuinely Lindblad-like and recovers the Fermi's golden rule features in the semiclassical limit. Applications to the prototypical case of a semiconductor quantum dot exposed to incoherent phonon excitation peaked around a central mode are discussed, highlighting the success of our formalism with respect to the critical issues of the conventional Markov limit.

**6.    The quantum walk search algorithm: Factors affecting efficiency**  
Neil B. Lovett, Matthew Everitt, Robert M. Heath, Viv Kendon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4366  
<blockquote>
<p>
We numerically study the quantum walk search algorithm of Shenvi, Kempe and Whaley [PRA \textbf{67} 052307] and the factors which affect its efficiency in finding an individual state from an unsorted set. Previous work has focused purely on the effects of the dimensionality of the dataset to be searched. Here, we consider the effects of interpolating between dimensions, connectivity of the dataset, and the possibility of disorder in the underlying substrate: all these factors affect the efficiency of the search algorithm. We show that, as well as the strong dependence on the spatial dimension of the structure to be searched, there are also secondary dependencies on the connectivity and symmetry of the lattice, with greater connectivity providing a more efficient algorithm. In addition, we also show that the algorithm can tolerate a non-trivial level of disorder in the underlying substrate.

**7.    Quantum phase properties of nonlinear optical phenomena**  
R. Tanas, A. Miranowicz, Ts. Gantsog  
Progress in Optics, Vol. 35 (1996), 355--446  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4602  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review some quantum-phase descriptions of optical fields. We focus on real fields that can be generated in practice in various nonlinear optical processes. Thus, we rather avoid discussions of phase formalisms as such and try to exploit their practical applicability in the description of optical fields. In the description of the phase properties we use two different, though related formalisms: the Pegg-Barnett Hermitian phase formalism and the formalism based on $s$-parametrized phase distributions.

**8.    Environment-Assisted Error Correction of Single-Qubit Phase Damping**  
Benjamin Trendelkamp-Schroer, Julius Helm, Walter T. Strunz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4806  
<blockquote>
<p>
Open quantum system dynamics of random unitary type may in principle be fully undone. Closely following the scheme of environment-assisted error correction proposed by Gregoratti and Werner [M. Gregoratti and R. F. Werner, J. Mod. Opt. 50(6), 915-933 (2003)], we explicitly carry out all steps needed to invert a phase-damping error on a single qubit. Furthermore, we extend the scheme to a mixed-state environment. Surprisingly, we find cases for which the uncorrected state is closer to the desired state than any of the corrected ones.

**10.    Dispersion-based control of modal characteristics for parametric down-conversion in a multimode waveguide**  
Michal Karpinski, Czeslaw Radzewicz, Konrad Banaszek  
Opt. Lett. 37, 878 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5064  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report generation of near-infrared photon pairs in fundamental spatial modes via type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO4) nonlinear waveguide supporting multiple transverse modes. This demonstrates experimentally a versatile scheme for controlling the spatial characteristics of the produced nonclassical light based on exploitation of intermodal dispersion. The down-converted photons are characterized by the measurement of the beam quality factors in the heralded regime.

**11.    Observable measure of bipartite quantum correlations**  
Davide Girolami, Gerardo Adesso  
Physical Review Letters 108, 150403 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5083  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a measure Q of bipartite quantum correlations for arbitrary two-qubit states, expressed as a state-independent function of the density matrix elements. The amount of quantum correlations can be quantified experimentally by measuring the expectation value of a small set of observables on up to four copies of the state, without the need for a full tomography. We extend the measure to 2 x d systems, providing its explicit form in terms of observables and applying it to the relevant class of multiqubit states employed in the deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit model. The number of required measurements to determine Q in our scheme does not increase with d. Our results provide an experimentally friendly framework to estimate quantitatively the degree of general quantum correlations in composite systems.

**12.    Towards practical classical processing for the surface code**  
Austin G. Fowler, Adam C. Whiteside, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 180501 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5133  
<blockquote>
<p>
The surface code is unarguably the leading quantum error correction code for 2-D nearest neighbor architectures, featuring a high threshold error rate of approximately 1%, low overhead implementations of the entire Clifford group, and flexible, arbitrarily long-range logical gates. These highly desirable features come at the cost of significant classical processing complexity. We show how to perform the processing associated with an nxn lattice of qubits, each being manipulated in a realistic, fault-tolerant manner, in O(n^2) average time per round of error correction. We also describe how to parallelize the algorithm to achieve O(1) average processing per round, using only constant computing resources per unit area and local communication. Both of these complexities are optimal.

**13.    Quantum Copy-Protection and Quantum Money**  
Scott Aaronson  
Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, pages 229-242, 2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5353  
<blockquote>
<p>
Forty years ago, Wiesner proposed using quantum states to create money that is physically impossible to counterfeit, something that cannot be done in the classical world. However, Wiesner's scheme required a central bank to verify the money, and the question of whether there can be unclonable quantum money that anyone can verify has remained open since. One can also ask a related question, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected programs, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more programs for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern computational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles relative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family of functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior can be quantumly copy-protected. This provides the first formal evidence that these tasks are achievable. The technical core of our result is a "Complexity-Theoretic No-Cloning Theorem," which generalizes both the standard No-Cloning Theorem and the optimality of Grover search, and might be of independent interest. Our security argument also requires explicit constructions of quantum t-designs. Moving beyond the oracle world, we also present an explicit candidate scheme for publicly-verifiable quantum money, based on random stabilizer states; as well as two explicit schemes for copy-protecting the family of point functions. We do not know how to base the security of these schemes on any existing cryptographic assumption. (Note that without an oracle, we can only hope for security under some computational assumption.)

**14.    Non-Markovian dynamics and strong coupling between atomic transitions and a waveguide continuum edge**  
Ting Chen, Ren-Bao Liu  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 043830 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5386  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, one-dimensional waveguides provide directional transfer of quantum information. A single-mode waveguide has a density-of-states singularity at the lower cut-off frequency, which resembles sharp resonances of a cavity but with non-Markovian dynamics. Thus we put forward schemes of coupling atomic transitions and a waveguide continuum edge. We first present a scheme of spin-photon quantum interface operating in the non-Markovian regime for a $\Lambda$-type three-level system coupled to a waveguide. Then we show that strong coupling between atomic transitions and a waveguide continuum edge can lead to vacuum Rabi oscillations and bound polariton states.

**16.    A Geometrical Manifold of Entropy for Fisher Information and Quantum Potential**  
Germano Resconi, Ignazio Licata, Davide Fiscaletti  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5491  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is here proposed a geometric approach for the problem of describing entropy in a quantum system. We make use of an extension of tensor calculus called morphogenetic calculus. By using such formalism we express the entropy of a quantum system as the superposition of Boltzmann entropies. In this way we also provide a reading of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. Moreover we show that the Bohm quantum potential emerges as a consequence of the classical equilibrium under the constraint of a minimum condition of Fisher information. In this way, Bohm quantum potential appears as a non-Euclidean deformation of the probabilistic space. Finally we investigate the possible quantum-relativistic extensions of the theory and the connections with the problem of quantum gravity.

**17.    On the qubit limit of cavity nonlinear optics**  
Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5583  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many proposals for solid-state photonic implementations of quantum information processing utilize high-quality optical resonators to achieve strong coupling between guided fields and heterogeneously incorporated qubits. Given the practical difficulty of accurately placing quantum dots, vacancy centers, or other such atom-like emitters throughout a complex nanophotonic circuit, it would be natural to consider whether high-quality resonators could be used in conjunction with bulk optical nonlinearities to create optically-coupled qubit degrees of freedom via lithographic patterning of a homogeneous medium. A recent limit theorem for quantum stochastic differential equations can be used to prove rigorously that this should be possible, in principle, using resonators incorporating a strongly Kerr-nonlinear, $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear, or two-photon absorbing material with very low loss at the fundamental optical wavelength.

**18.    Stochastic Schr?dinger Equation for a Non-Markovian Dissipative Qubit-Qutrit System**  
Jun Jing, Ting Yu  
EPL, 96 (2011) 44001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of a hybrid open system consisting of one qubit and one qutrit by employing a stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation to generate diffusive quantum trajectories. We have established an exact quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation for the dissipative qubit-qutrit system coupled to a bosonic heat bath at zero temperature. As an important application, the non-Markovian QSD equation is employed to simulate the entanglement decay and generation measured by negativity. Finally, some steady state properties of the hybrid system are also discussed.

PRA 85, 042306 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6718  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a novel scheme for the generation of entangled states of two spatially separated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers with two whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators, which are coupled either by an optical fiber-taper waveguide, or by the evanescent fields of the WGM. We show that, the steady state of the two NV centers can be steered into a singlet-like state through a dissipative quantum dynamical process, where the cavity decay plays a positive role and can help drive the system to the target state. The protocol may open up promising perspectives for quantum communications and computations with this solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamic system.

The coherent interaction between ensembles of helium Rydberg atoms and microwave fields in the vicinity of a solid-state co-planar waveguide is reported. Rydberg-Rydberg transitions, at frequencies between 25 GHz and 38 GHz, have been studied for states with principal quantum numbers in the range 30 - 35 by selective electric-field ionization. An experimental apparatus cooled to 100 K was used to reduce effects of blackbody radiation. Inhomogeneous, stray electric fields emanating from the surface of the waveguide have been characterized in frequency- and time-resolved measurements and coherence times of the Rydberg atoms on the order of 250 ns have been determined.

<p>
This review presents a unified view on the problem of Anderson localization in one-dimensional weakly disordered systems with short-range and long-range statistical correlations in random potentials. The following models are analyzed: the models with continuous potentials, the tight-binding models of the Anderson type, and various Kronig-Penney models with different types of perturbations. Main attention is payed to the methods of obtaining the localization length in dependence on the controlling parameters of the models. Specific interest is in an emergence of effective mobility edges due to certain long-range correlations in a disorder. The predictions of the theoretical and numerical analysis are compared to recent experiments on microwave transmission through randomly filled waveguides.

**25.    Selectivity in Probabilistic Causality: Where Psychology Runs Into Quantum Physics**  
Ehtibar N. Dzhafarov, Janne V. Kujala  
Journal of Mathematical Psychology 56 (2012) 54-63  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2388  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a set of several inputs into a system (e.g., independent variables characterizing stimuli) and a set of several stochastically non-independent outputs (e.g., random variables describing different aspects of responses), how can one determine, for each of the outputs, which of the inputs it is influenced by? The problem has applications ranging from modeling pairwise comparisons to reconstructing mental processing architectures to conjoint testing. A necessary and sufficient condition for a given pattern of selective influences is provided by the Joint Distribution Criterion, according to which the problem of "what influences what" is equivalent to that of the existence of a joint distribution for a certain set of random variables. For inputs and outputs with finite sets of values this criterion translates into a test of consistency of a certain system of linear equations and inequalities (Linear Feasibility Test) which can be performed by means of linear programming. While new in the behavioral context, both this test and the Joint Distribution Criterion on which it is based have been previously proposed in quantum physics, in dealing with generalizations of Bell inequalities for the quantum entanglement problem. The parallels between this problem and that of selective influences in behavioral sciences is established by observing that noncommuting measurements in quantum physics are mutually exclusive and can therefore be treated as different levels of one and the same factor.

**26.    Entanglement Entropy of Fermi Liquids via Multi-dimensional Bosonization**  
Wenxin Ding, Alexander Seidel, Kun Yang  
Phys. Rev. X 2, 011012 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3004  
<blockquote>
<p>
The logarithmic violations of the area law, i.e. an "area law" with logarithmic correction of the form $S \sim L^{d-1} \log L$, for entanglement entropy are found in both 1D gapless system and for high dimensional free fermions. The purpose of this work is to show that both violations are of the same origin, and in the presence of Fermi liquid interactions such behavior persists for 2D fermion systems. In this paper we first consider the entanglement entropy of a toy model, namely a set of decoupled 1D chains of free spinless fermions, to relate both violations in an intuitive way. We then use multi-dimensional bosonization to re-derive the formula by Gioev and Klich [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 100503 (2006)] for free fermions through a low-energy effective Hamiltonian, and explicitly show the logarithmic corrections to the area law in both cases share the same origin: the discontinuity at the Fermi surface (points). In the presence of Fermi liquid (forward scattering) interactions, the bosonized theory remains quadratic in terms of the original local degrees of freedom, and after regularizing the theory with a mass term we are able to calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively up to second order in powers of the coupling parameter for a special geometry via the replica trick. We show that these interactions do not change the leading scaling behavior for the entanglement entropy of a Fermi liquid. At higher orders, we argue that this should remain true through a scaling analysis.

<p>
We use Raman-assisted tunneling in an optical superlattice to generate large tunable effective magnetic fields for ultracold atoms. When hopping in the lattice, the accumulated phase shift by an atom is equivalent to the Aharonov-Bohm phase of a charged particle exposed to a staggered magnetic field of large magnitude, on the order of one flux quantum per plaquette. We study the ground state of this system and observe that the frustration induced by the magnetic field can lead to a degenerate ground state for non-interacting particles. We provide a measurement of the local phase acquired from Raman-induced tunneling, demonstrating time-reversal symmetry breaking of the underlying Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the quantum cyclotron orbit of single atoms in the lattice exposed to the magnetic field is directly revealed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5350  
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern approaches to stock pricing in quantitative finance are typically founded on the 'Black-Scholes model' and the underlying 'random walk hypothesis'. Empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable situations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the random walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this reason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism', elaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the stock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual system where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks prices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain that a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but its value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the trading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level. Then, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism' that describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is intuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until it is traded. This result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a theoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance.

We study light propagation in a photonic system that shows stepwise evolution in a discretized environment. It resembles a discrete-time version of photonic waveguide arrays or quantum walks. By introducing controlled photon losses to our experimental setup, we observe unexpected effects like sub-exponential energy decay and formation of complex fractal patterns. This demonstrates that the interplay of linear losses, discreteness and energy gradients leads to genuinely new coherent phenomena in classical and quantum optical experiments. Moreover, the influence of decoherence is investigated.

<p>
We present an information geometric characterization of Grover's quantum search algorithm. First, we quantify the notion of quantum distinguishability between parametric density operators by means of the Wigner-Yanase quantum information metric. We then show that the quantum searching problem can be recast in an information geometric framework where Grover's dynamics is characterized by a geodesic on the manifold of the parametric density operators of pure quantum states constructed from the continuous approximation of the parametric quantum output state in Grover's algorithm. We also discuss possible deviations from Grover's algorithm within this quantum information geometric setting.
