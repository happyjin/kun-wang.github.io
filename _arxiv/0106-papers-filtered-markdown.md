**1.    The Secrecy Capacity of Practical Quantum Cryptography**  
G. Gilbert, M. Hamrick  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106033  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum cryptography has attracted much recent attention due to its potential for providing secret communications that cannot be decrypted by any amount of computational effort. This is the first analysis of the secrecy of a practical implementation of the BB84 protocol that simultaneously takes into account and presents the {\it full} set of complete analytical expressions for effects due to the presence of pulses containing multiple photons in the attenuated output of the laser, the finite length of individual blocks of key material, losses due to error correction, privacy amplification, continuous authentication, errors in polarization detection, the efficiency of the detectors, and attenuation processes in the transmission medium. The analysis addresses eavesdropping attacks on individual photons rather than collective attacks in general. Of particular importance is the first derivation of the necessary and sufficient amount of privacy amplification compression to ensure secrecy against the loss of key material which occurs when an eavesdropper makes optimized individual attacks on pulses containing multiple photons. It is shown that only a fraction of the information in the multiple photon pulses is actually lost to the eavesdropper.

**2.    N-fold Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics - General Formalism -**  
Hideaki Aoyama, Masatoshi Sato, Toshiaki Tanaka  
Nucl.Phys. B619 (2001) 105-127  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report general properties of N-fold supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. N-fold supersymmetry is characterized by supercharges which are N-th polynomials of momentum. Relations between the anti-commutator of the supercharges and the Hamiltonian, the spectra, the Witten index, the non-renormalization theorems and the quasi-solvability are examined. We also present further investigation about a particular class of N-fold supersymmetric models which we dubbed type A. Algebraic equations which determine a part of spectra of type A models are presented, and the non-renormalization theorem are generalized. Finally, we present a possible generalization of N-fold supersymmetry in multi-dimensional quantum mechanics.

**3.    Secrecy, Computational Loads and Rates in Practical Quantum Cryptography**  
G. Gilbert, M. Hamrick  
Algorithmica (2002) 34: 314-339  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106043  
<blockquote>
<p>
A number of questions associated with practical implementations of quantum cryptography systems having to do with unconditional secrecy, computational loads and effective secrecy rates in the presence of perfect and imperfect sources are discussed. The different types of unconditional secrecy, and their relationship to general communications security, are discussed in the context of quantum cryptography. In order to actually carry out a quantum cryptography protocol it is necessary that sufficient computational resources be available to perform the various processing steps, such as sifting, error correction, privacy amplification and authentication. We display the full computer machine instruction requirements needed to support a practical quantum cryptography implementation. We carry out a numerical comparison of system performance characteristics for implementations that make use of either weak coherent sources of light or perfect single photon sources, for eavesdroppers making individual attacks on the quantum channel characterized by different levels of technological capability. We find that, while in some circumstances it is best to employ perfect single photon sources, in other situations it is preferable to utilize weak coherent sources. In either case the secrecy level of the final shared cipher is identical, with the relevant distinguishing figure-of-merit being the effective throughput rate.

**4.    New Developments in the Casimir Effect**  
M. Bordag, U. Mohideen, V.M. Mostepanenko  
Phys.Rept.353:1-205,2001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106045  
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a review of both new experimental and theoretical developments in the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect results from the alteration by the boundaries of the zero-point electromagnetic energy. Unique to the Casimir force is its strong dependence on shape, switching from attractive to repulsive as function of the size, geometry and topology of the boundary. Thus the Casimir force is a direct manifestation of the boundary dependence of quantum vacuum. We discuss in depth the general structure of the infinities in the field theory which are removed by a combination of zeta-functional regularization and heat kernel expansion. Different representations for the regularized vacuum energy are given. The Casimir energies and forces in a number of configurations of interest to applications are calculated. We stress the development of the Casimir force for real media including effects of nonzero temperature, finite conductivity of the boundary metal and surface roughness. Also the combined effect of these important factors is investigated in detail on the basis of condensed matter physics and quantum field theory at nonzero temperature. The experiments on measuring the Casimir force are also reviewed, starting first with the older measurements and finishing with a detailed presentation of modern precision experiments. The latter are accurately compared with the theoretical results for real media. At the end of the review we provide the most recent constraints on the corrections to Newtonian gravitational law and other hypothetical long-range interactions at submillimeter range obtained from the Casimir force measurements.

**5.    Grover Algorithm with zero theoretical failure rate**  
G. L. Long  
Phys. Rev. A64 (2001) 022307  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106071  
<blockquote>
<p>
In standard Grover's algorithm for quantum searching, the probability of finding the marked item is not exactly 1. In this Letter we present a modified version of Grover's algorithm that searches a marked state with full successful rate. The modification is done by replacing the phase inversion by two phase rotation through angle $\phi$. The rotation angle is given analytically to be $\phi=2 \arcsin(\sin{\pi\over (4J+6)}\over \sin\beta)$, where $\sin\beta={1\over \sqrt{N}}$, $N$ the number of items in the database, and $J$ an integer equal to or greater than the integer part of $({\pi\over 2}-\beta)/(2\beta)$. Upon measurement at $(J+1)$-th iteration, the marked state is obtained with certainty.

**6.    Interaction representation method for Markov master equations in quantum optics**  
Alexander Chebotarev, Julio Garcia, Roberto Quezada  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106094  
<blockquote>
<p>
Conditions sufficient for a quantum dynamical semigroup (QDS) to be unital are proved for a class of problems in quantum optics with Hamiltonians which are self-adjoint polynomials of any finite order in creation and annihilation operators. The order of the Hamiltonian may be higher than the order of completely positive part of the formal generator of a QDS. The unital property of a minimal quantum dynamical semigroup implies the uniqueness of the solution of the corresponding Markov master equation in the class of quantum dynamical semigroups and, in the corresponding representation, it ensures preservation of the trace or unit operator. We recall that only in the unital case the formal generator of MME determines uniquely the corresponding QDS.

**7.    Dirac's equation in 1+1 D from a random walk**  
M. Ibison  
Chaos, Solitons, and Fractals vol. 10, pp. 1-16 (1999)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106105  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper is an investigation of the class of real classical Markov processes without a birth process that will generate the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions. The Markov process is assumed to evolve in an extra (ordinal) time dimension. The derivation requires that occupation by the Dirac particle of a space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector. Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time (including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of observation.

**8.    Optimum detection for extracting maximum information from symmetric qubit sets**  
Jun Mizuno, Mikio Fujiwara, Makoto Akiba, Tetsuya Kawanishi, Stephen M. Barnett, Masahide Sasaki  
PHYSICAL REVIEW A, VOLUME 65, 012315 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106164  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a class of optimum detection strategies for extracting the maximum information from sets of equiprobable real symmetric qubit states of a single photon. These optimum strategies have been predicted by Sasaki et al. [Phys. Rev. A{\bf 59}, 3325 (1999)]. The peculiar aspect is that the detections with at least three outputs suffice for optimum extraction of information regardless of the number of signal elements. The cases of ternary (or trine), quinary, and septenary polarization signals are studied where a standard von Neumann detection (a projection onto a binary orthogonal basis) fails to access the maximum information. Our experiments demonstrate that it is possible with present technologies to attain about 96% of the theoretical limit.
