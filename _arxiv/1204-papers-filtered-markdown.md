**1.    Spin Squeezing under Non-Markovian Channels by Hierarchy Equation Method**  
Xiaolei Yin, Jian Ma, Xiaoguang Wang, Franco Nori  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 012308 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0093  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study spin squeezing under non-Markovian channels, and consider an ensemble of $N$ independent spin-1/2 particles with exchange symmetry. Each spin interacts with its own bath, and the baths are independent and identical. For this kind of open system, the spin squeezing under decoherence can be investigated from the dynamics of the local expectations, and the multi-qubit dynamics can be reduced into the two-qubit one. The reduced dynamics is obtained by the hierarchy equation method, which is a exact without rotating-wave and Born-Markov approximation. The numerical results show that the spin squeezing displays multiple sudden vanishing and revival with lower bath temperature, and it can also vanish asymptotically.

**2.    A study of Wigner functions for discrete-time quantum walks**  
M. Hinarejos, M.C. Banuls, A. Perez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1050  
<blockquote>
<p>
We perform a systematic study of the discrete time Quantum Walk on one dimension using Wigner functions, which are generalized to include the chirality (or coin) degree of freedom. In particular, we analyze the evolution of the negative volume in phase space, as a function of time, for different initial states. This negativity can be used to quantify the degree of departure of the system from a classical state. We also relate this quantity to the entanglement between the coin and walker subspaces.

**3.    Decoherence on a two-dimensional quantum walk using four- and two-state particle**  
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46, 105306 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1287  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the decoherence effects originating from state flipping and depolarization for two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks using four-state and two-state particles. By quantifying the quantum correlations between the particle and position degree of freedom and between the two spatial ($x-y$) degrees of freedom using measurement induced disturbance (MID), we show that the two schemes using a two-state particle are more robust against decoherence than the Grover walk, which uses a four-state particle. We also show that the symmetries which hold for two-state quantum walks breakdown for the Grover walk, adding to the various other advantages of using two-state particles over four-state particles.

**4.    Mixed-state quantum transport in correlated spin networks**  
Ashok Ajoy, Paola Cappellaro  
PRA 85, 042305 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1363  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum spin networks can be used to transport information between separated registers in a quantum information processor. To find a practical implementation, the strict requirements of ideal models for perfect state transfer need to be relaxed, allowing for complex coupling topologies and general initial states. Here we analyze transport in complex quantum spin networks in the maximally mixed state and derive explicit conditions that should be satisfied by propagators for perfect state transport. Using a description of the transport process as a quantum walk over the network, we show that it is necessary to phase correlate the transport processes occurring along all the possible paths in the network. We provide a Hamiltonian that achieves this correlation, and use it in a constructive method to derive engineered couplings for perfect transport in complicated network topologies.

**5.    Quantum Statistics of Surface Plasmon Polaritons in Metallic Stripe Waveguides**  
Giuliana Di Martino, Yannick Sonnefraud, Stéphane Kéna-Cohen, Mark Tame, ?ahin K. ?zdemir, M. S. Kim, Stefan A. Maier  
Nano Lett. 12, 2504 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1487  
<blockquote>
<p>
Single surface plasmon polaritons are excited using photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The mean excitation rates, intensity correlations and Fock state populations are studied. The observed dependence of the second order coherence in our experiment is consistent with a linear uncorrelated Markovian environment in the quantum regime. Our results provide important information about the effect of loss for assessing the potential of plasmonic waveguides for future nanophotonic circuitry in the quantum regime.

**6.    Efficient $N$-particle $W$ state concentration with different parity check gates**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Lan Zhou, Yu-Wei Sheng, Sheng-Mei Zhao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1492  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an universal way to concentrate an arbitrary $N$-particle less-entangled $W$ state into a maximally entangled $W$ state with different parity check gates. It comprises two protocols. The first protocol is based on the linear optical elements say the partial parity check gate and the second one uses the quantum nondemolition (QND) to construct the complete parity check gate. Both of which can achieve the concentration task. These protocols have several advantages. First, it can obtain a maximally entangled W state only with the help of some single photons, which greatly reduces the number of entanglement resources. Second, in the first protocol, only linear optical elements are required which is feasible with current techniques. Third, in the second protocol, it can be repeated to perform the concentration step and get a higher success probability. All these advantages make it be useful in current quantum communication and computation applications.

**7.    Dynamics of coupled cavity arrays embedded in a non-Markovian bath**  
Xinyu Zhao, Jun Jing, J. Q. You, Ting Yu  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 14, No. 9&10 (2014) 0741  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1708  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of a coupled $N$-cavity model is studied based on the quantum state diffusion (QSD) approach. The time-local Di\'{o}si-Gisin-Strunz equation and the corresponding exact master equation are derived for the model consisting of a coupled cavity array. The resulting QSD equation serves as a stochastic solution to a genuine $N$-partite continuous-variable (CV) system. Several non-Markovian effects are studied in two interesting examples -- two-cavity and three-cavity, under different boundary conditions. We have shown that the environment-memory can facilitate the cat-like state transfer from one cavity to another in the case of a strongly non-Markovian environment.

**8.    Optimal error correction in topological subsystem codes**  
Ruben S. Andrist, H. Bombin, Helmut G. Katzgraber, M. A. Martin-Delgado  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 050302(R) (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1838  
<blockquote>
<p>
A promising approach to overcome decoherence in quantum computing schemes is to perform active quantum error correction using topology. Topological subsystem codes incorporate both the benefits of topological and subsystem codes, allowing for error syndrome recovery with only 2-local measurements in a two-dimensional array of qubits. We study the error threshold for topological subsystem color codes under very general external noise conditions. By transforming the problem into a classical disordered spin model, we estimate using Monte Carlo simulations that topological subsystem codes have an optimal error tolerance of 5.5(2)%. This means there is ample space for improvement in existing error-correcting algorithms that typically find a threshold of approximately 2%.

**9.    Polarization entanglement generation at 1.5 um based on walk-off effect due to fiber birefringence**  
Qiang Zhou, Wei Zhang, Pengxiang Wang, Yidong Huang, Jiangde Peng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2107  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this Letter, a linear scheme to generate polarization entanglement at 1.5 um based on commercial polarization maintained dispersion shifted fiber (PM-DSF) is proposed. The birefringent walk-off effect of the pulsed pump light in the PM-DSF provides an effective way to suppress the vector scattering processes of spontaneous four wave mixing. A 90 degree offset of fiber polarization axes is introduced at the midpoint of the fiber to realize the quantum superposition of the two correlated photon states generated by the two scalar processes on different fiber polarization axes, leading to polarization entanglement generation. Experiments of the indistinguishable property on single side and two-photon interference in two non-orthogonal polarization bases are demonstrated. A two photon interference fringe visibility of 89\pm3% is achieved without subtracting the background counts, demonstrating its great potential in developing highly efficient and stable fiber based polarization-entangled quantum light source at optical communication band.

**10.    Unification of witnessing initial system-environment correlations and witnessing non-Markovianity**  
César A. Rodríguez-Rosario, Kavan Modi, Laura Mazzola, Alán Aspuru-Guzik  
EPL 99 (2012) 20010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2197  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show the connection between a witness that detects dynamical maps with initial system-environment correlations and a witness that detects non-Markovian open quantum systems. Our analysis is based on studying the role that state preparation plays in witnessing violations of contractivity of open quantum system dynamics. Contractivity is a property of some quantum processes where the trace distance of density matrices decrease with time. From this, we show how a witness of initial-correlations is an upper bound to a witness of non-Markovianity. We discuss how this relationship shows further connections between initial system-environment correlations and non-Markovianity at an instance of time in open quantum systems.

**11.    Electron vortex beams in a magnetic field: A new twist on Landau levels and Aharonov-Bohm states**  
Konstantin Y. Bliokh, Peter Schattschneider, Jo Verbeeck, Franco Nori  
Phys. Rev. X 2, 041011 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2780  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the propagation of the recently-discovered electron vortex beams in a longitudinal magnetic field. We consider both the Aharonov-Bohm configuration with a single flux line and the Landau case of a uniform magnetic field. While stationary Aharonov-Bohm modes represent Bessel beams with flux- and vortex-dependent probability distributions, stationary Landau states manifest themselves as non-diffracting Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Furthermore, the Landau-state beams possess field- and vortex-dependent phases: (i) the Zeeman phase from coupling the quantized angular momentum to the magnetic field and (ii) the Gouy phase, known from optical Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Remarkably, together these phases determine the structure of Landau energy levels. This unified Zeeman-Landau-Gouy phase manifests itself in a nontrivial evolution of images formed by various superpositions of modes. We demonstrate that, depending on the chosen superposition, the image can rotate in a magnetic field with either (i) Larmor, (ii) cyclotron (double-Larmor), or (iii) zero frequency. At the same time, its centroid always follows the classical cyclotron trajectory, in agreement with the Ehrenfest theorem. Remarkably, the non-rotating superpositions reproduce stable multi-vortex configurations that appear in rotating superfluids. Our results open up an avenue for the direct electron-microscopy observation of fundamental properties of free quantum electron states in magnetic fields.

**12.    Zero Discord for Markovian Bipartite Systems**  
M. Arsenijevic, J. Jeknic-Dugic, M. Dugic  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2789  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent observation that almost all quantum states bear non-classical correlations [A. Ferraro et al, Phys. Rev. A 81, 052328 (2010)] may seem to imply that the Markovian bipartite systems are practically deprived of zero discord states. Nevertheless, complementary to the result of Ferraro et al, we construct a model of a Markovian bipartite system providing zero discord for arbitrary long time interval, that we term 'Markovian classicality'. Our model represents a matter-of-principle formal proof, i.e. a sufficient condition for the, otherwise not obvious, existence of Markovian classicality. Interestingly enough, we are not able to offer any alternative to the model. Physical relevance of the model is twofold. First, the model is in intimate relation to the topics of quantum information locality, quantum discord saturation and quantum decorrelation. Second, the model is of the general physical interest. It pertains to a specific structure (decomposition into parts/subsystems) of a composite system, not to a special physical kind of composite systems. Being a characteristic of a structure, by definition, the model of Markovian classicality is not a model of sudden death of discord. We emphasize wide-range implications of our results.

**13.    A Versatile Source of Single Photons for Quantum Information Processing**  
Michael F?rtsch, Josef Fürst, Christoffer Wittmann, Dmitry Strekalov, Andrea Aiello, Maria V. Chekhova, Christine Silberhorn, Gerd Leuchs, Christoph Marquardt

http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3056  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum state of a single photon stands among the most fundamental and intriguing manifestations of quantum physics. At the same time single photons and pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of linear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure. These fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological progress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum memories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However, further progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different components. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and photon pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon source should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength range and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while retaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different wavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair source based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped, monolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and supports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently generated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning over 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13 MHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.2$. This compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different physical quantum systems and renders it ideal for the implementation of quantum repeaters and optical quantum information processing.

**14.    Quantum walks with encrypted data**  
Peter P. Rohde, Joseph F. Fitzsimons, Alexei Gilchrist  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 150501 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3370  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the setting of networked computation, data security can be a significant concern. Here we consider the problem of allowing a server to remotely manipulate client supplied data, in such a way that both the information obtained by the client about the server's operation and the information obtained by the server about the client's data are significantly limited. We present a protocol for achieving such functionality in two closely related models of restricted quantum computation -- the Boson sampling and quantum walk models. Due to the limited technological requirements of the Boson scattering model, small scale implementations of this technique are feasible with present-day technology.

**15.    Effect of Markov and Non-Markov Classical Noise on Entanglement Dynamics**  
Paolo Bordone, Fabrizio Buscemi, Claudia Benedetti  
Fluct. Noise Lett. 11 (2012) 1242003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3412  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the effect of a classical noise into the entanglement dynamics between two particles, initially entangled, subject to continuous time quantum walks in a one-dimensional lattice. The noise is modeled by randomizing the transition amplitudes from one site to another. Both Markovian and non-Markovian environments are considered. For the Markov regime an exponential decay of the initial quantum correlation is found, while the loss of coherence of the quantum state increases monotonically with time up to a saturation value depending upon the degrees of freedom of the system. For the non-Markov regime the presence or absence of entanglement revival and entanglement sudden death phenomena is found or deduced depending on the peculiar characteristics of the noise. Our results indicate that the entanglement dynamics in the non-Markovian regime is affected by the persistence of the memory effects of the environment and by its intrinsic features.

<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-dimensional quantum walks can exhibit highly non-trivial topological structure, providing a powerful tool for simulating quantum information and transport systems. We present a flexible implementation of a 2D optical quantum walk on a lattice, demonstrating a scalable quantum walk on a non-trivial graph structure. We realized a coherent quantum walk over 12 steps and 169 positions using an optical fiber network. With our broad spectrum of quantum coins we were able to simulate the creation of entanglement in bipartite systems with conditioned interactions. Introducing dynamic control allowed for the investigation of effects such as strong non-linearities or two-particle scattering. Our results illustrate the potential of quantum walks as a route for simulating and understanding complex quantum systems.

Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 263, 392 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3587  
<blockquote>
<p>
Impossibility of finding local realistic models for quantum correlations due to entanglement is an important fact in foundations of quantum physics, gaining now new applications in quantum information theory. We present an in-depth description of a method of testing the existence of such models, which involves two levels of optimization: a higher-level non-linear task and a lower-level linear programming (LP) task. The article compares the performances of the existing implementation of the method, where the LPs are solved with the simplex method, and our new implementation, where the LPs are solved with a matrix-free interior point method. We describe in detail how the latter can be applied to our problem, discuss the basic scenario and possible improvements and how they impact on overall performance. Significant performance advantage of the matrix-free interior point method over the simplex method is confirmed by extensive computational results. The new method is able to solve problems which are orders of magnitude larger. Consequently, the noise resistance of the non-classicality of correlations of several types of quantum states, which has never been computed before, can now be efficiently determined. An extensive set of data in the form of tables and graphics is presented and discussed. The article is intended for all audiences, no quantum-mechanical background is necessary.

<p>
We study the influence of a chaotic environment in the evolution of an open quantum system. We show that there is an inverse relation between chaos and non-Markovianity. In particular, we remark on the deep relation of the short time non-Markovian behavior with the revivals of the average fidelity amplitude-a fundamental quantity used to measure sensitivity to perturbations and to identify quantum chaos. The long time behavior is established as a finite size effect which vanishes for large enough environments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3793  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an experimental procedure to determine the usefulness of a measurement scheme for quantum error correction (QEC). A QEC scheme typically requires the ability to prepare entangled states, to carry out multi-qubit measurements, and to perform certain recovery operations conditioned on measurement outcomes. As a consequence, the experimental benchmark of a QEC scheme is a tall order because it requires the conjuncture of many elementary components. Our scheme opens the path to experimental benchmarks of individual components of QEC. Our numerical simulations show that certain parity measurements realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics are on the verge of being useful for QEC.

<p>
Three-level atomic gradient echo memory (lambda-GEM) is a proposed candidate for efficient quantum storage and for linear optical quantum computation with time-bin multiplexing. In this paper we investigate the spatial multimode properties of a lambda-GEM system. Using a high-speed triggered CCD, we demonstrate the storage of complex spatial modes and images. We also present an in-principle demonstration of spatial multiplexing by showing selective recall of spatial elements of a stored spin wave. Using our measurements, we consider the effect of diffusion within the atomic vapour and investigate its role in spatial decoherence. Our measurements allow us to quantify the spatial distortion due to both diffusion and inhomogeneous control field scattering and compare these to theoretical models.

We give an intuitive explanation for the thermal resilience, showing that it is due to the unique choice of the probe qubit architecture of our model.

<blockquote>
<p>
We systematically investigated perfect state transfer between antipodal nodes of discrete time quantum walks on variants of the cycles C_4, C_6 and C_8 for three choices of coin operator. Perfect state transfer was found, in general, to be very rare, only being preserved for a very small number of ways of modifying the cycles. We observed that some of our useful modifications of C_4 could be generalised to an arbitrary number of nodes, and present three families of graphs which admit quantum walks with interesting dynamics either in the continuous time walk, or in the discrete time walk for appropriate selections of coin and initial conditions. These dynamics are either periodicity, perfect state transfer, or very high fidelity state transfer. These families are modifications of families known not to exhibit periodicity or perfect state transfer in general. The robustness of the dynamics is tested by varying the initial state, interpolating between structures and by adding decoherence.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6021  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a novel scheme for universal quantum computation based on spinless interacting bosonic quantum walkers on a piecewise-constant graph, described by the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Arbitrary X and Z rotations are constructed, as well as an entangling two-qubit CPHASE gate and a SWAP gate. Quantum information is encoded in the positions of the walkers on the graph, as in previous quantum walk-based proposals for universal quantum computation, though in contrast to prior schemes this proposal requires a number of vertices only linear in the number of encoded qubits. It allows single-qubit measurements to be performed in a straightforward manner with localized operators, and can make use of existing quantum error correcting codes either directly within the universal gate set provided, or by extending the lattice to a third dimension. We present an intuitive example of a logical encoding to implement the seven-qubit Steane code. Finally, an implementation in terms of ultracold atoms in optical lattices is suggested.

M. Mahdian, M. Bagherpour Jeddi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6124  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the quantum correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) dynamics of two coupled spin qubits with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction influenced by a locally external magnetic field along $z$-direction and coupled to bath spin-1/2 particles as independent non-Markovian environment. We find that with increasing $D_{z}$ and decreasing $J_{z}$, the value of entanglement and quantum discord increase for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic materials. Not that, this growth is more for the ferromagnetic materials. In addition, we perceive that entanglement and quantum discord decrease with increased temperature and increased coupling constants between reduced system and bath. But, strong quantum correlations within the spins of bath reduce decoherence effects. We discuss about type of the constituent material of the central spins that it can speedup the quantum information processing and as a result, we perceive that one can improve and control the quantum information processing with correct selection of the properties of the reduced system ($J$, $J_{z}$, $D_{z}$).

<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that quantum systems yield non-exponential (power law) decay on long time scales, associated with continuum threshold effects contributing to the survival probability for a prepared initial state. For an open quantum system consisting of a discrete state coupled to continuum, we study the case in which a discrete bound state of the full Hamiltonian approaches the energy continuum as the system parameters are varied. We find in this case that at least two regions exist yielding qualitatively different power law decay behaviors; we term these the long time `near zone' and long time `far zone.' In the near zone the survival probability falls off according to a $t^{-1}$ power law, and in the far zone it falls off as $t^{-3}$. We show that the timescale $T_Q$ separating these two regions is inversely related to the gap between the discrete bound state energy and the continuum threshold. In the case that the bound state is absorbed into the continuum and vanishes, then the time scale $T_Q$ diverges and the survival probability follows the $t^{-1}$ power law even on asymptotic scales. Conversely, one could study the case of an anti-bound state approaching the threshold before being ejected from the continuum to form a bound state. Again the $t^{-1}$ power law dominates precisely at the point of ejection.

**31.    Asymptotic dynamics of coined quantum walks on percolation graphs**

<p>
Quantum walks obey unitary dynamics: they form closed quantum systems. The system becomes open if the walk suffers from imperfections represented as missing links on the underlying basic graph structure, described by dynamical percolation. Openness of the system's dynamics creates decoherence, leading to strong mixing. We present a method to analytically solve the asymptotic dynamics of coined, percolated quantum walks for a general graph structure. For the case of a circle and a linear graph we derive the explicit form of the asymptotic states. We find that a rich variety of asymptotic evolutions occur: not only the fully mixed state, but other stationary states; stable periodic and quasiperiodic oscillations can emerge, depending on the coin operator, the initial state, and the topology of the underlying graph.

<p>
It is known that under some assumptions the hitting time in quantum Markov chains is quadratically smaller than the hitting time in classical Markov chains. This work extends this result for decoherent quantum Markov chains. The decoherence is introduced using a percolation-like graph model, which allows us to define a decoherent quantum hitting time and to establish a decoherent-intensity range for which the decoherent quantum hitting time is quadratically smaller than the the classical hitting time. The detection problem under decoherence is also solved with quadratic speedup in this range.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum frequency conversion (QFC), a nonlinear optical process in which the frequency of a quantum light field is altered while conserving its non-classical correlations, was first demonstrated 20 years ago. Meanwhile, it is considered an essential tool for the implementation of quantum repeaters since it allows for interfacing quantum memories with telecom-wavelength photons as quantum information carriers. Here we demonstrate efficient (>30%) QFC of visible single photons (711 nm) emitted by a quantum dot (QD) to a telecom wavelength (1,313 nm). Analysis of the first and second-order coherence before and after wavelength conversion clearly proves that important properties, such as the coherence time and photon antibunching, are fully conserved during the frequency translation process. Our findings underline the great potential of single photon sources on demand in combination with QFC as a promising technique for quantum repeater schemes.

<blockquote>
<p>
A discrete-time method for solving problems in optimal quantum control is presented. Controlling the time discretized markovian dynamics of a quantum system can be reduced to a Markov-decision process. We demonstrate this method in this with a class of simple one qubit systems, which are also discretized in space. For the task of state preparation we solve the examples both numerically and analytically with dynamic programming techniques.

<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss how we formulate time evolution of physical quantities in the framework of the Rigged QED (Quantum Electrodynamics). The Rigged QED is a theory which has been proposed to treat dynamics of electrons, photons and atomic nuclei in atomic and molecular systems in a quantum field theoretic way. To solve the dynamics in the Rigged QED, we need different techniques from those developed for the conventional QED. As a first step toward this issue, we propose a procedure to expand the Dirac field operator, which represents electrons, by the electron annihilation/creation operators and solutions of the Dirac equation for electrons in nuclear potential. Similarly, the Schrodinger field operators, which represent atomic nuclei, are expanded by nucleus annihilation/creation operators. Then we derive time evolution equations for these annihilation and creation operators and discuss how time evolution of the operators for physical quantities can be calculated. In the end, we propose a method to approximate the evolution equations of the operators by the evolution equations for the density matrices of electrons and atomic nuclei. Under this approximation, we carry out numerical simulation of the time evolution of electron charge density of a hydrogen atom.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present measurement results for the gradient of the Casimir force between an Au-coated sphere and an Au-coated plate obtained by means of an atomic force microscope operated in a frequency shift technique. This experiment was performed at a pressure of 3x10^{-8} Torr with hollow glass sphere of 41.3 mcm radius. Special attention is paid to electrostatic calibrations including the problem of electrostatic patches. All calibration parameters are shown to be separation-independent after the corrections for mechanical drift are included. The gradient of the Casimir force was measured in two ways with applied compensating voltage to the plate and with different applied voltages and subsequent subtraction of electric forces. The obtained mean gradients are shown to be in mutual agreement and in agreement with previous experiments performed using a micromachined oscillator. The obtained data are compared with theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory including corrections beyond the proximity force approximation. An independent comparison with no fitting parameters demonstrated that the Drude model approach is excluded by the data at a 67% confidence level over the separation region from 235 to 420 nm. The theoretical approach using the generalized plasma-like model is shown to be consistent with the data over the entire measurement range. Corrections due to the nonlinearity of oscillator are calculated and the application region of the linear regime is determined. A conclusion is made that the results of several performed experiments call for a thorough analysis of the basics of the theory of dispersion forces.

<p>
We developed a discrete two-dimensional model of a cantilever which incorporates the effects of inhomogeneity, the geometry of an attached particle, and the influence of external time-dependent forces. We provide a comparison between the solutions for our discrete model and its continuous limit. The rotational-vibrational mode is studied in detail. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate usefulness of our model for many applications when a cantilever has a complicated geometry and is affected by time-depended and distributed external forces.

<p>
Photon sources are fundamental components for any quantum photonic technology. The ability to generate high count-rate and low-noise correlated photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion using bulk crystals has been the cornerstone of modern quantum optics. However, future practical quantum technologies will require a scalable integration approach, and waveguide-based photon sources with high-count rate and low-noise characteristics will be an essential part of chip-based quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate photon pair generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon micro-ring resonator, reporting a maximum coincidence-to-accidental (CAR) ratio of 602 (+-) 37, and a maximum photon pair generation rate of 123 MHz (+-) 11 KHz. To overcome free-carrier related performance degradations we have investigated reverse biased p-i-n structures, demonstrating an improvement in the pair generation rate by a factor of up to 2, with negligible impact on CAR.

<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-longitudinal-mode lasers have been believed to be good candidates as pump sources for optical frequency conversion. However, we present a semi-classical model for frequency conversion of optical signals with a multimode pump laser, which shows that fluctuations of the instantaneous pump power limit the conversion efficiency. In an experiment, we upconverted a 1550 nm optical signal in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide using with a multi-longitudinal-mode laser, an observed a maximum conversion efficiency of 70%, in good agreement with our theoretical model. Compared to single-mode pumping, multimode pumping is not a suitable technique for attaining stable near-unity-efficiency frequency conversion. However, the results obtained here could find application in characterization of the spectral or temporal structure of multi-longitudinal-mode lasers.
