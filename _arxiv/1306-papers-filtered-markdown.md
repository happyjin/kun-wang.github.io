**1.    Hyperentanglement concentration for two-photon four-qubit systems with linear optics**  
Bao-Cang Ren, Fang-Fang Du, Fu-Guo Deng  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012302 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0050  
<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement, defined as the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, has attracted much attention recently. Here we investigate the possibility of concentrating the two-photon four-qubit systems in partially hyperentangled states in both the spatial mode and the polarization DOFs with linear optics. We first introduce our parameter-splitting method to concentrate the systems in the partially hyperentangled states with known parameters, including partially hyperentangled Bell states and cluster states. Subsequently, we present another two nonlocal hyperentanglement concentration protocols (hyper-ECPs) for the systems in partially hyperentangled unknown states, resorting to the Schmidt projection method. It will be shown that our parameter-splitting method is very efficient for the concentration of the quantum systems in partially entangled states with known parameters, resorting to linear-optical elements only. All these four hyper-ECPs are feasible with current technology and they may be useful in long-distance quantum communication based on hyperentanglement as they require only linear optical elements.

**2.    The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159  
<blockquote>
<p>
In honor of Alan Turing's hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one of Turing's obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call "Knightian freedom": a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope for "freedom" in the universe's boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb's paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time, quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.

**3.    Non-Zero Syndromes and Syndrome Measurement Order for the [[7,1,3]] Quantum Error Correction Code**  
Yaakov S. Weinstein  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0498  
<blockquote>
<p>
The [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code uses sets of three syndrome measurements to separately detect bit-flip and phase-flip errors. To comply with the strictures of fault tolerance and thus stem the possible spread of errors to multiple qubits, each set of syndromes is repeated twice. Still, there remains flexibility in the order in which the sets of syndromes are implemented. Here we explore different orders noting that the best choice of syndrome order, determined by the fidelity of the state after noisy error correction, will depend on whether or not an error is detected. To put these results in proper context we first explore the effect on output state fidelity of detecting an error. We find that this fidelity is significantly lower than when no error is detected and may decrease when the single qubit error probabilities decrease.

**4.    Photonic circuits for iterative decoding of a class of low-density parity-check codes**  
Dmitri S. Pavlichin, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0583  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic circuits in which stateful components are coupled via guided electromagnetic fields are natural candidates for native implementation of iterative stochastic algorithms based on propagation of information around a graph. Conversely, such message passing algorithms suggest novel circuit architectures for signal processing and computation that are well matched to nanophotonic device physics. Here we construct and analyze a quantum optical model of a photonic circuit for iterative decoding of a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes called expander codes. Our circuit can be understood as an open quantum system whose autonomous dynamics map straightforwardly onto the subroutines of an LDPC decoding scheme, with several attractive features: it can operate in the ultra-low power regime of photonics in which quantum fluctuations become significant, is robust to noise and component imperfections, achieves comparable performance to known iterative algorithms for this class of codes, and provides an instructive example of how nanophotonic cavity quantum electrodynamic components can enable useful new information technology even if the solid-state qubits on which they are based are heavily dephased and cannot support large-scale entanglement.

**5.    Quantum simulation of the Riemann-Hurwitz zeta function**  
Boyan T. Torosov, Giuseppe Della Valle, Stefano Longhi  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 032103 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0692  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a simple realization of a quantum simulator of the Riemann-Hurwitz (RH) \zeta\ function based on a truncation of its Dirichlet representation. We synthesize a nearest-neighbour-interaction Hamiltonian, satisfying the property that the temporal evolution of the autocorrelation function of an initial bare state of the Hamiltonian reproduces the RH function along the line \sigma+i \omega t of the complex plane, with \sigma>1. The tight-binding Hamiltonian with engineered hopping rates and site energies can be implemented in a variety of physical systems, including trapped ion systems and optical waveguide arrays. The proposed method is scalable, which means that the simulation can be in principle arbitrarily accurate. Practical limitations of the suggested scheme, arising from a finite number of lattice sites N and from decoherence, are briefly discussed.

**6.    Understanding the effects of leakage in superconducting quantum error detection circuits**  
Joydip Ghosh, Austin G. Fowler, John M. Martinis, Michael R. Geller  
Physical Review A 88, 062329 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0925  
<blockquote>
<p>
The majority of quantum error detection and correction protocols assume that the population in a qubit does not leak outside of its computational subspace. For many existing approaches, however, the physical qubits do possess more than two energy levels and consequently are prone to such leakage events. Analyzing the effects of leakage is therefore essential to devise optimal protocols for quantum gates, measurement, and error correction. In this work, we present a detailed study of leakage in a two-qubit superconducting stabilizer measurement circuit. We simulate the repeated ancilla-assisted measurement of a single $\sigma^z$ operator for a data qubit, record the outcome at the end of each measurement cycle, and explore the signature of leakage events in the obtained readout statistics. An analytic model is also developed that closely approximates the results of our numerical simulations. We find that leakage leads to destructive features in the quantum error detection scheme, making additional hardware and software protocols necessary.

Hao-Sheng Zeng, Yan-Ping Zheng, Ning Tang, Guo-You Wang  
Quantum Inf Process 12, 1637(2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0950  
<blockquote>
<p>
For two qubits independently coupled to their respective structured reservoirs (Lorentzian spectrum), quantum beats for entanglement and discord are found which are the result of quantum interference between correlation oscillations induced by local non-Markovian environments. We also discuss the preservation of quantum correlations by the effective suppression of the spontaneous emission.

**8.    Quantum error correction for collective rotation channels on qudits**  
Chi-Kwong Li, Mikio Nakahara, Yiu-Tung Poon, Nung-Sing Sze  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0981  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider collective rotation channels of qudits, i.e., quantum channels with operators in the set $${\mathcal E}(m,n) = \{\underbrace{U\otimes \cdots \otimes U}_n: U \in {\mathrm{SU}}(m)\}$$. This is done by analyzing the algebra decomposition of the algebra ${\mathcal A}(m,n)$ generated by ${\mathcal E}(m,n)$. We summarize the results for the channels on qubits, and obtain the maximum dimension of the noiseless subsystem which can be used as the quantum error correction code for the channel. Then we extend the results to general $m$. In particular, it is shown that quantum error correction rate, i.e., the number of correctable qudits over the number of transmitted qudits, always approaches 1 for a suitable noiseless subsystem. Moreover, one can determine the maximum dimension of the noiseless subsystem by solving a non-trivial discrete optimization problem. The maximum dimension for the case when $m = 3$ is determined by a combination of mathematical analysis and the symbolic software Mathematica. In addition to the study of quantum error correction, the results also have implications in Lie theory and representation theory concerning the algebra ${\mathcal A}(m,n)$

**9.    Efficient experimental estimation of fidelity of linear optical quantum Toffoli gate**  
Michal Micuda, Michal Sedlak, Ivo Straka, Martina Mikova, Miloslav Dusek, Miroslav Jezek, Jaromir Fiurasek  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 160407 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1141  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an efficiently measurable lower bound on quantum process fidelity of N-qubit controlled-Z gates. This bound is determined by average output state fidelities for N partially conjugate product bases. A distinct advantage of our approach is that only fidelities with product states need to be measured while keeping the total number of measurements much smaller than what is necessary for full quantum process tomography. As an application, we use this method to experimentally estimate quantum process fidelity F of a three-qubit linear optical quantum Toffoli gate and we find that F>=0.83. We also demonstrate the entangling capability of the gate by preparing GHZ-type three-qubit entangled states from input product states.

**10.    Distilling single-photon entanglement from photon loss and decoherence**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Lan Zhou  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1601  
<blockquote>
<p>
Single-photon entanglement may be the simplest type of entanglement but it is of vice importance in quantum communication. Here we present a practical protocol for distilling the single-photon entanglement from both photon loss and decoherence. With the help of some local single photons, the probability of single photon loss can be decreased and the less-entangled state can also be recovered to maximally entangled state simultaneously. It only requires some linear optical elements which makes it feasible in current experiment condition. This protocol might find applications in current quantum communications based on the quantum repeaters.

**11.    Effective noise channels for encoded quantum systems**  
Frederik Kesting, Florian Fr?wis, Wolfgang Dür  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 042305 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1738  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate effective noise channels for encoded quantum systems with and without active error correction. Noise acting on physical qubits forming a logical qubit is thereby described as a logical noise channel acting on the logical qubits, which leads to a significant decrease of the effective system dimension. This provides us with a powerful tool to study entanglement features of encoded quantum systems. We demonstrate this framework by calculating lower bounds on the lifetime of distillable entanglement and the negativity for encoded multipartite qubit states with different encodings. At the same time, this approach leads to a simple understanding of the functioning of (concatenated) error correction codes.

**12.    Two-color narrowband photon pair source with high brightness based on clustering in a monolithic waveguide resonator**  
Kai-Hong Luo, Harald Herrmann, Stephan Krapick, Raimund Ricken, Viktor Quiring, Hubertus Suche, Wolfgang Sohler, Christine Silberhorn  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1756  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on an integrated non-degenerate narrowband photon pair source produced at 890 nm and 1320nm via type II parametric down-conversion in a periodically poled waveguide with high-reflective dielectric mirrors deposited on the waveguide end faces. The conversion spectrum consists of three clusters and only 3 to 4 longitudinal modes with about 150 MHz bandwidth in each cluster. The high conversion efficiency in the waveguide, together with the spectral clustering in the double resonator, leads to a high brightness of $3\times10^3~$pairs/(s$\cdot$mW$\cdot$MHz). The compact and rugged monolithic design makes the source a versatile device for various applications in quantum communication.

**13.    Unidirectional quantum walks: evolution and exit times**  
Miquel Montero  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012333 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1807  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we focus our attention on a particle that follows a unidirectional quantum walk, an alternative version of the nowadays widespread discrete-time quantum walk on a line. Here the walker at each time step can either remain in place or move in a fixed direction, e.g., rightward or upward. While both formulations are essentially equivalent, the present approach leads to consider Discrete Fourier Transforms, which eventually results in obtaining explicit expressions for the wave functions in terms of finite sums, and allows the use of efficient algorithms based on the Fast Fourier Transform. The wave functions here obtained govern the probability of finding the particle at any given location, but determine as well the exit-time probability of the walker from a fixed interval, which is also analyzed.

**14.    A Quantum Physical Design Flow Using ILP and Graph Drawing**  
Maryam Yazdani, Morteza Saheb Zamani, Mehdi Sedighi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2037  
<blockquote>
<p>
Implementing large-scale quantum circuits is one of the challenges of quantum computing. One of the central challenges of accurately modeling the architecture of these circuits is to schedule a quantum application and generate the layout while taking into account the cost of communications and classical resources as well as the maximum exploitable parallelism. In this paper, we present and evaluate a design flow for arbitrary quantum circuits in ion trap technology. Our design flow consists of two parts. First, a scheduler takes a description of a circuit and finds the best order for the execution of its quantum gates using integer linear programming (ILP) regarding the classical resources (qubits) and instruction dependencies. Then a layout generator receives the schedule produced by the scheduler and generates a layout for this circuit using a graph-drawing algorithm. Our experimental results show that the proposed flow decreases the average latency of quantum circuits by about 11% for a set of attempted benchmarks and by about 9% for another set of benchmarks compared with the best in literature.

**15.    Energy gap at first-order quantum phase transitions: An anomalous case**  
Junichi Tsuda, Yuuki Yamanaka, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 82 (2013) 114004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2142  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the rate of closing of the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state, as a function of system size, behaves in many qualitatively different ways at first-order quantum phase transitions of the infinite-range quantum XY model. Examples include polynomial, exponential and even factorially fast closing of the energy gap, all of which coexist along a single axis of the phase diagram representing the transverse field. This variety emerges depending on whether or not the transverse field assumes a rational number as well as on how the series of system size is chosen toward the thermodynamic limit. We conclude that there is no generically applicable rule to relate the rate of gap closing and the order of quantum phase transitions as is often implied in many studies, in particular in relation to the computational complexity of quantum annealing in its implementation as quantum adiabatic computation.

Eric Schneider, Kevin Zhou, Gerald Gilbert, Yaakov S. Weinstein  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2202  
<blockquote>
<p>
Microclusters are the basic building blocks used to construct cluster states capable of supporting fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we explore the consequences of errors on microcluster construction using two error models. To quantify the effect of the errors we calculate the fidelity of the constructed microclusters and the fidelity with which two such microclusters can be fused together. Such simulations are vital for gauging the capability of an experimental system to achieve fault tolerance.

In this paper, we revisit one of the prototypical PT-symmetric oligomers, namely the trimer. We find all the relevant branches of "regular" solutions and analyze the bifurcations and instabilities thereof. Our work generalizes the formulation that was proposed recently in the case of dimers for the so-called "ghost states" of trimers, which we also identify and connect to symmetry-breaking bifurcations from the regular states. We also examine the dynamics of unstable trimers, as well as those of the ghost states in the parametric regime where the latter are found to exist. Finally, we present the current state of the art for optical experiments in PT-symmetric trimers, as well as experimental results in a gain-loss-gain three channel waveguide structure.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3366  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon and a physical resource that can be used for quantum information processing. Cluster states are multipartite states with an entanglement structure that is robust to local measurements and can be used for measurement-based quantum computation. To date, the largest optically generated cluster state consists of 8 entangled qubits, while the largest multipartite entangled state of any sort to date involves 14 trapped ions. These implementations consist of quantum entities separated in space, and in general each experimental apparatus is used only once. This inherent inefficiency prohibits the generation of larger entangled states due to the experimental setup requiring additional components as the state grows. Here, we report the experimental generation and full characterisation of an ultra-large-scale entangled state containing more than 10,000 entangled modes that is equivalent to a continuous-variable cluster state up to local phase shifts. This is an improvement by 3 orders of magnitude over the largest entangled states created to date. The entangled modes are individually addressable, finite-duration wavepackets of light in two beams that are multiplexed in the time domain and created deterministically. Our ultra-large-scale entangled states are an important contribution to investigations of quantum information processing.

**19.    Fault-tolerant Operations for Universal Blind Quantum Computation**  
Chia-Hung Chien, Rodney Van Meter, Sy-Yen Kuo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3664  
<blockquote>
<p>
Blind quantum computation is an appealing use of quantum information technology because it can conceal both the client's data and the algorithm itself from the server. However, problems need to be solved in the practical use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. On an example circuit, the computational cost measured in T gates executed by the client is 97 times more than performing the original computation directly, without using the server, even before applying error correction. (The client still benefits due to drastically reduced memory requirements.) Broadbent et al. proposed running error correction over blind computation, but our first protocol applies one layer of Steane's [[7,1,3]] code underneath instead. This protocol has better fault tolerance, but still results in a substantial overhead. We propose another protocol to reduce the client's computational load by transferring the qubit preparation to the server. For each logical qubit used in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical qubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one. This protocol also protects the client's fault-tolerant preparation of logical qubits from a side-channel attack.

**20.    Single-atom polarizer**  
W. A. Li, L. F. Wei  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3746  
<blockquote>
<p>
Traditional polarizer provides a way to convert an unknown polarization into a specified polarization. According to Malus, the intensity of the transmission is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and the incident polarization. There, the intensity refers to the collective behavior of many photons. Here we propose a novel approach to realizing polarization-filtering at single-photon level. We discuss how a single planepolarized photon transports through a polarized analyzer generated by a single atom (the so-called "single-atom polarizer"), and provide a single quantum version of Malus's law. We investigate the quantum scattering of a single photon by a controllable four-level atom inside a one-dimensional waveguide. By using real-space theoretical approach, we obtain analytic expressions of the transmission spectrum of the photon. Then, our numerical experiments show that the transmitted probability of the incident photon can be controlled by selecting the polarized-dependent transition configuration of the driven atom. The application of such a single-atom polarizer to linear optical quantum information processing is also discussed.

**21.    Boson-Sampling in the light of sample complexity**  
C. Gogolin, M. Kliesch, L. Aolita, J. Eisert  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3995  
<blockquote>
<p>
Boson-Sampling is a classically computationally hard problem that can - in principle - be efficiently solved with quantum linear optical networks. Very recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the Haar measure. In this work we show that in this setup, with probability exponentially close to one in the number of bosons, no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the Boson-Sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than exponentially many samples. This means that the two distributions are operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge. We carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the implemented unitary for devising non-symmetric algorithms that could potentially improve upon this. We conclude that due to the very fact that Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard, efficient classical certification of Boson-Sampling devices seems to be out of reach.

**22.    Success rates for linear optical generation of cluster states in coincidence basis**  
D. B. Uskov, P. M. Alsing, M. L. Fanto, L. Kaplan, A. M. Smith  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4062  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on theoretical research in photonic cluster-state computing. Finding optimal schemes of generating non-classical photonic states is of critical importance for this field as physically implementable photon-photon entangling operations are currently limited to measurement-assisted stochastic transformations. A critical parameter for assessing the efficiency of such transformations is the success probability of a desired measurement outcome. At present there are several experimental groups which are capable of generating multi-photon cluster states carrying more than eight qubits. Separate photonic qubits or small clusters can be fused into a single cluster state by a probabilistic optical CZ gate conditioned on simultaneous detection of all photons with 1/9 success probability of each gate. This design mechanically follows the original theoretical scheme of cluster state generation proposed more than a decade ago by Raussendorf, Browne and Briegel. The optimality of the destructive CZ gate in application to linear optical cluster state generation has not been analyzed previously. Our results reveal that this method is far from the optimal one. Employing numerical optimization we have identified that maximal success probability of fusing n unentangled dual-rail optical qubits into a linear cluster state is equal to 1/2^(n-1); m-tuple of photonic Bell pair states, commonly generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, can be fused into a single cluster with the maximal success probability of 1/4^(m-1).

Strong cross-Kerr non-linearities have been long sought after for quantum information applications.

Using a two-photon transition, we observe phase modulations of up to $\pi$rad with a signal power of 25$\mu$W, corresponding to a non-linear Kerr coefficient, $n_2$, of $0.8 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^2$/W, or $1.3 \times 10^{-6}$ rad per photon.

<p>
Assisted with linear optical manipulation, single photon, entangled photon pairs, photon measurement, and classical communication, a scheme for two-spin qubits phase gate and teleportation of a CNOT gate between two electron spins from acting on local qubits to acting on remote qubits using quantum dots in optical microcavities is proposed. The scheme is based on spin selective photon reflection from the cavity and is achieved in a deterministic way by the sequential detection of photons and the single-qubit rotations of a single electron spin in a self-assembled GaAs/InAs quantum dot. The feasibility of the scheme is assessed showing that high average fidelities of the gates are achievable in the weak-coupling regime when the side leakage and cavity loss are low. The scheme opens promising perspectives for long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum computation, and constructing remote quantum information processing networks.

The problems of optimally estimating a phase, a direction, and the orientation of a Cartesian frame (or trihedron) with general pure states are addressed.

A general mathematical framework to deal with the asymptotic limit of many qubits or large angular momentum is introduced and used to obtain analytical results for all the relevant cases under consideration. Parameter estimation with abstention is also formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, for which very efficient numerical optimization techniques exist.

<p>
We are considering a quantum version of the penny flip game, whose implementation is influenced by the environment that causes decoherence of the system.

Our results show that the Pauli strategy is no longer a Nash equilibrium under decoherence. We attempt to optimize the players' control pulses in the aforementioned setup to allow them to achieve higher probability of winning the game compared to the Pauli strategy.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we study the non-Markovian behaviour of a qubit coupled to an environment in which the corresponding classical dynamics change from integrable to chaotic. We show that in the transition region, where the dynamics has both regular islands and chaotic areas, the average non-Markovian behaviour is enhanced to values even larger than in the regular regime. This effect can be related to the non-Markovian behaviour as a function of the the initial state of the environment, where maxima are attained at the regions dividing separate areas in classical phase space, particularly at the borders between chaotic and regular regions. Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the fidelity of the environment -- which determine the non-Markovianity measure -- give a precise image of the classical phase portrait.

Local operations with classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations are two classes of quantum operations that play key roles in the study of quantum entanglement.

**29.    Effects of the rotating wave and secular approximations on non-Markovianity**  
H. M?kel?, M. M?tt?nen  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 052111 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6301  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and the secular approximation (SA) on the non-Markovian behavior in the spin-boson model at zero-temperature. We find that both the RWA and SA lead to a dramatic reduction in the observed non-Markovianity. In general, non-Markovian dynamics is observed for the whole relaxation time of the system, whereas the RWA and SA lead to such dynamics only on the short time scale of the environmental correlation time. Thus, the RWA and SA are not necessarily justified in the studies of non-Markovianity although they can estimate the state of the system precisely. Furthermore, we derive an accurate analytical expression for the non-Markovianity measure without the RWA or SA. This expression yields important insight into the physics of the problem.

<p>
The Pauli exclusion principle gives an upper bound of 1 on the natural occupation numbers. Recently there has been an intriguing amount of theoretical evidence that there is a plethora of additional generalized Pauli restrictions or (in)equalities, of kinematic nature, satisfied by these numbers. Here for the first time a numerical analysis of the nature of such constraints is effected in real atoms. The inequalities are nearly saturated, or quasi-pinned. For rank-six and rank-seven approximations for lithium, the deviation from saturation is smaller than the lowest occupancy number. For a rank-eight approximation we find well-defined families of saturation conditions.

**31.    Implementation of an impedance-matched Λsystem by dressed-state engineering**  
Kazuki Koshino, Kunihiro Inomata, Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, Yasunobu Nakamura  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6695  
<blockquote>
<p>
In one-dimensional optical setups, light-matter interaction is drastically enhanced by the interference between the incident and scattered fields. Particularly, in the impedance-matched \Lambda-type three-level systems, a single photon deterministically induces the Raman transition and switches the electronic state of the system. Here we show that such a \Lambda system can be implemented by using dressed states of a driven superconducting qubit and a resonator. The input microwave photons are perfectly absorbed and are down-converted into other frequency modes in the same waveguide. The proposed setup is applicable to single-photon detection in the microwave domain.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6757  
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a short review on an interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and statistical mechanics. We first give a pedagogical introduction to the stabilizer formalism, which is an efficient way to describe an important class of quantum states, the so-called stabilizer states, and quantum operations on them. Furthermore, graph states, which are a class of stabilizer states associated with graphs, and their applications for measurement-based quantum computation are also mentioned. Based on the stabilizer formalism, we review two interdisciplinary topics. One is the relation between quantum error correction codes and spin glass models, which allows us to analyze the performances of quantum error correction codes by using the knowledge about phases in statistical models. The other is the relation between the stabilizer formalism and partition functions of classical spin models, which provides new quantum and classical algorithms to evaluate partition functions of classical spin models.

<blockquote>
<p>
Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are an ideal match for integrated quantum photonic circuits due to their high detection efficiency for telecom wavelength photons. Quantum optical technology also requires single-photon detection with low dark count rate and high timing accuracy. Here we present very low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors based on NbTiN thin films patterned directly on top of Si3N4 waveguides. We systematically investigate a large variety of detector designs and characterize their detection noise performance. Milli-Hz dark count rates are demonstrated over the entire operating range of the nanowire detectors which also feature low timing jitter. The ultra-low dark count rate, in combination with the high detection efficiency inherent to our traveling wave detector geometry, gives rise to a measured noise equivalent power at the 10^(-20) W/Hz^(1/2) level.

**34.    Characterization of the degree of Musical non-Markovianity**  
Maria Mannone, Giuseppe Compagno  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0229  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, as an aid for musical analysis, in computational musicology mathematical and informatics tools have been developed to quantitatively characterize some aspects of musical compositions. To a musical composition can be attributed by ear a certain amount of memory. This results associated to repetitions and similarities of the patterns in musical scores. To higher variations, a lower amount of memory is perceived. However musical memory of a score has never been quantitatively defined. Here we aim to give such a measure following an approach similar to that used in Physics to quantify the memory (non-Markovianity) of open quantum systems. We have applied this measure to some existing musical compositions, showing that the results obtained via this quantifier agree with what one expects by ear. The Musical non-Markovianity quantifier can thus be used as a new tool that can aid quantitative musical analysis.

**35.    Stability of topologically-protected quantum computing proposals as seen through spin glasses**  
Helmut G. Katzgraber, Ruben S. Andrist  
J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 473 012019 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0540  
<blockquote>
<p>
Sensitivity to noise makes most of the current quantum computing schemes prone to error and nonscalable, allowing only for small proof-of-principle devices. Topologically-protected quantum computing aims at solving this problem by encoding quantum bits and gates in topological properties of the hardware medium that are immune to noise that does not impact the entire system at once. There are different approaches to achieve topological stability or active error correction, ranging from quasiparticle braidings to spin models and topological color codes. The stability of these proposals against noise can be quantified by their error threshold. This figure of merit can be computed by mapping the problem onto complex statistical-mechanical spin-glass models with local disorder on nontrival lattices that can have many-body interactions and are sometimes described by lattice gauge theories. The error threshold for a given source of error then represents the point in the temperature-disorder phase diagram where a stable symmetry-broken phase vanishes. An overview of the techniques used to estimate the error thresholds is given, as well as a summary of recent results on the stability of different topologically-protected quantum computing schemes to different error sources.

This paper derives a new directional uncertainty principle for quaternion valued functions subject to the quaternion Fourier transformation. This can be generalized to establish directional uncertainty principles in Clifford geometric algebras with quaternion subalgebras.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2838  
<blockquote>
<p>
The mathematical formalism of quantum theory has been successfully used in human cognition to model decision processes and to deliver representations of human knowledge. As such, quantum cognition inspired tools have improved technologies for Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. In this paper, we overview the quantum cognition approach developed in our Brussels team during the last two decades, specifically our identification of quantum structures in human concepts and language, and the modeling of data from psychological and corpus-text-based experiments. We discuss our quantum-theoretic framework for concepts and their conjunctions/disjunctions in a Fock-Hilbert space structure, adequately modeling a large amount of data collected on concept combinations. Inspired by this modeling, we put forward elements for a quantum contextual and meaning-based approach to information technologies in which 'entities of meaning' are inversely reconstructed from texts, which are considered as traces of these entities' states.

**38.    Repulsive Interactions in Quantum Hall Systems as a Pairing Problem**

Phys. Rev. B 88, 165303 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3268  
<blockquote>
<p>
A subtle relation between Quantum Hall physics and the phenomenon of pairing is unveiled. By use of second quantization, we establish a connection between (i) a broad class of rotationally symmetric two-body interactions within the lowest Landau level and (ii) integrable hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin type Hamiltonians that arise in (p_{x}+ip_{y}) superconductivity. Specifically, we show that general Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as a sum of repulsive non-commuting (p_{x}+ip_{y})-type pairing Hamiltonians. For the Laughlin sequence, it is observed that this problem is frustration free and zero energy ground states lie in the common null space of all of these non-commuting Hamiltonians. This property allows for the use of a new truncated basis of pairing configurations in which to express Laughlin states at general filling factors. We prove separability of arbitrary Haldane pseudopotentials, providing explicit expressions for their second quantized forms, and further show by explicit construction how to exploit the topological equivalence between different geometries (disk, cylinder, and sphere) sharing the same topological genus number, in the second quantized formalism, through similarity transformations. As an application of the second quantized approach, we establish a "squeezing principle" that applies to the zero modes of a general class of Hamiltonians, which includes but is not limited to Haldane pseudopotentials. We also show how one may establish (bounds on) "incompressible filling factors" for those Hamiltonians. By invoking properties of symmetric polynomials, we provide explicit second quantized quasi-hole generators; the generators that we find directly relate to bosonic chiral edge modes and further make aspects of dimensional reduction in the Quantum Hall systems precise.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4002  
<blockquote>
<p>
The stochastic evolution of quantum systems during measurement is arguably the most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system typically steers it towards a classical state, destroying any initial quantum superposition and any entanglement with other quantum systems. Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum systems can generate entanglement starting from an uncorrelated state. Of special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement, which projects a register of quantum bits (qubits) to a state with an even or odd total number of excitations. Crucially, a parity meter must discern the two parities with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite numerous proposals for atomic, semiconducting, and superconducting qubits, realizing a parity meter creating entanglement for both even and odd measurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. We realize a time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits using the cavity in a 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture and phase-sensitive parametric amplification. Using postselection, we produce entanglement by parity measurement reaching 77% concurrence. Incorporating the parity meter in a feedback-control loop, we transform the entanglement generation from probabilistic to fully deterministic, achieving 66% fidelity to a target Bell state on demand. These realizations of a parity meter and a feedback-enabled deterministic measurement protocol provide key ingredients for active quantum error correction in the solid state.

Phys. Rev. D, v.87, 125031 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4979  
<blockquote>
<p>
We obtain constraints on parameters of the Yukawa-type corrections to Newton's gravitational law from measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force between surfaces coated with ferromagnetic metal Ni and from measurements of the Casimir force between Au-coated sinusoidally corrugated surfaces at various angles between corrugations. It is shown that constraints following from the experiment with magnetic surfaces are slightly weaker than currently available strongest constraints, but benefit from increased reliability and independence of systematic effects.The constraints derived from the experiment with corrugated surfaces within the interaction region from 11.6 to 29.2\,nm are stronger up to a factor of 4 than the strongest constraints derived from other experiments. The possibility of further strengthening of constraints on non-Newtonian gravity by using the configurations with corrugated boundaries is proposed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5706  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamics of nonclassical states of light in coupled optical structures and we demonstrate a number of intriguing features associated with such arrangements. By diagonalizing the system's Hamiltonian, we show that these geometries can support eigenstates having anomalous optical intensity distribution with no classical counterpart. These features may provide new avenues towards manipulating light flow at the quantum level. By projecting the Hamiltonian operator on Hilbert subspaces spanning different numbers of photon excitations, we demonstrate that processes such as coherent transport, state localization and surface Bloch oscillations can take place in Fock space. Furthermore, we show that Hamiltonian representations of Fock space manifolds differing by one photon obey a discrete supersymmetry relation

**43.    Stochastic Variational Method as Quantization Scheme I: Field Quantization of Complex Klein-Gordan Equation**  
T. Koide, T. Kodama  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6922  
<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) is the generalization of the variation method to the case with stochastic variables. In the series of papers, we investigate the applicability of SVM as an alternative field quantization scheme. Here, we discuss the complex Klein-Gordon equation. In this scheme, the Euler-Lagrangian equation for the stochastic fields leads to the functional Schroedinger equation, which in turn can be interpreted as the ideal fluid equation in the functional space. We show that the Fock state vector is given by the stationary solution of these differential equations and various results in the usual canonical quantization can be reproduced, including the effect of anti-particles. The present formulation is a quantization scheme based on commutable variables, so that there appears no ambiguity associated with the ordering of operators, for example, in the definition of Noether charges.

**44.    A note on QUBO instances defined on Chimera graphs**  
Sanjeeb Dash  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1202  
<blockquote>
<p>
McGeoch and Wang (2013) recently obtained optimal or near-optimal solutions to some quadratic unconstrained boolean optimization (QUBO) problem instances using a 439 qubit D-Wave Two quantum computing system in much less time than with the IBM ILOG CPLEX mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) solver. The problems studied by McGeoch and Wang are defined on subgraphs -- with up to 439 nodes -- of Chimera graphs. We observe that after a standard reformulation of the QUBO problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), the specific instances used by McGeoch and Wang can be solved to optimality with the CPLEX MILP solver in much less time than the time reported in McGeoch and Wang for the CPLEX MIQP solver. However, the solution time is still more than the time taken by the D-Wave computer in the McGeoch-Wang tests.
