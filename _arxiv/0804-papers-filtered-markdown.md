**1.    Realization of the quantum Toffoli gate with trapped ions**

<blockquote>
<p>
Algorithms for quantum information processing are usually decomposed into sequences of quantum gate operations, most often realized with single- and two- qubit gates[1]. While such operations constitute a universal set for quantum computation, gates acting on more than two qubits can simplify the implementation of complex quantum algorithms[2]. Thus, a single three-qubit operation can replace a complex sequence of two-qubit gates, which in turn promises faster execution with potentially higher Fidelity. One important three-qubit operation is the quantum Toffoli gate which performs a NOT operation on a target qubit depending on the state of two control qubits. Here we present the first experimental realization of the quantum Toffoli gate in an ion trap quantum computer. Our implementation is particular effcient as we directly encode the relevant logic information in the motion of the ion string. [1] DiVincenzo, D. P.

**2.    Transforming quantum operations: quantum supermaps**  
G. Chiribella, G. M. D'Ariano, P. Perinotti  
Europhysics Letters 83, 30004 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0180  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concept of quantum supermap, describing the most general transformation that maps an input quantum operation into an output quantum operation. Since quantum operations include as special cases quantum states, effects, and measurements, quantum supermaps describe all possible transformations between elementary quantum objects (quantum systems as well as quantum devices). After giving the axiomatic definition of supermap, we prove a realization theorem, which shows that any supermap can be physically implemented as a simple quantum circuit. Applications to quantum programming, cloning, discrimination, estimation, information-disturbance trade-off, and tomography of channels are outlined.

**3.    Quantum State Engineering and Precision Metrology using State-Insensitive Light Traps**  
Jun Ye, H. J. Kimble, Hidetoshi Katori  
Science 320, 1734-1738 (2008).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0254  
<blockquote>
<p>
Precision metrology and quantum measurement often demand matter be prepared in well defined quantum states for both internal and external degrees of freedom. Laser-cooled neutral atoms localized in a deeply confining optical potential satisfy this requirement. With an appropriate choice of wavelength and polarization for the optical trap, two electronic states of an atom can experience the same trapping potential, permitting coherent control of electronic transitions independent of the atomic center-of-mass motion. We review a number of recent experiments that use this approach to investigate precision quantum metrology for optical atomic clocks and coherent control of optical interactions of single atoms and photons within the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We also provide a brief survey of promising prospects for future work.

**4.    Quantum computing using shortcuts through higher dimensions**

http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0272  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation offers the potential to solve fundamental yet otherwise intractable problems across a range of active fields of research. Recently, universal quantum-logic gate sets - the building blocks for a quantum computer - have been demonstrated in several physical architectures. A serious obstacle to a full-scale implementation is the sheer number of these gates required to implement even small quantum algorithms. Here we present and demonstrate a general technique that harnesses higher dimensions of quantum systems to significantly reduce this number, allowing the construction of key quantum circuits with existing technology. We are thereby able to present the first implementation of two key quantum circuits: the three-qubit Toffoli and the two-qubit controlled-unitary. The gates are realised in a linear optical architecture, which would otherwise be absolutely infeasible with current technology.

**5.    Entanglement and Non-locality in a Micro-Macroscopic system**  
Francesco De Martini, Fabio Sciarrino, Chiara Vitelli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0341  
<blockquote>
<p>
In recent years two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics have attracted a great deal of interest, namely the investigation on the irreducible nonlocal properties of Nature implied by quantum entanglement and the physical realization of the 'Schroedinger Cat'. In the present work a macro - state consisting of about 3.5 x 10^4 photons in a quantum superposition and entangled with a far apart single - photon state is generated. Then, the non-separability of the overall micro-macro system is demonstrated and the corresponding Bell's inequalities are found to be violated. Precisely, an entangled photon pair is created by a nonlinear optical process, then one photon of the pair is injected into an optical parametric amplifier operating for any input polarization state, i.e. into a phase-covariant cloning machine. Such transformation establishes a connection between the single photon and the multi particle fields. We then demonstrate the non-separability of the bipartite system by adopting a local filtering technique within a positive operator valued measurement.

**6.    Temporally multiplexed superposition states of continuous variables**  
Masahide Sasaki, Masahiro Takeoka, Hiroki Takahashi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0354  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study non-Gaussian states generated by two-photon subtraction from a cw squeezed light source. In a cw scheme one can subtract two photons from the source with a designated time separation and can genarate temporally multiplexed superposition states of continuous variables. We numerically study the properties of these states in the light of bosonic interference in the time domain. In an appropriate temporal mode amplified kittens are produced in a region where the time separation is comparable with the correlation time of squeezed packets.

**7.    Large amplitude coherent state superposition generated by a time-separated two-photon subtraction from a continuous wave squeezed vacuum**  
Masahiro Takeoka, Hiroki Takahashi, Masahide Sasaki  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 062315 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0464  
<blockquote>
<p>
Theoretical analysis is given for a two-photon subtraction from a continuous wave (CW) squeezed vacuum with finite time separation between two detection events. In the CW photon subtraction process, the generated states are inevitably described by temporal mutimode states. Our approach is based on Schr\"{o}dinger picture which provides mathematically simple forms and an intuitive understanding of its multimode structure. We show that, in our process, the photon subtracted squeezed vacuum is generated in two temporal modes and one of these modes acts as an ancillary mode to make the other one a large amplitude coherent state superposition.

**8.    Interaction of a two-level atom with a classical field in the context of Bohmian mechanics**  
S. V. Mousavi, M. Golshani  
Phys. Scr. 78 (2008) 035007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0505  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss Bohmian paths of the two-level atoms moving in a waveguide through an external resonance-producing field, perpendicular to the waveguide, and localized in a region of finite diameter. The time spent by a particle in a potential region is not well-defined in the standard quantum mechanics, but it is well-defined in the Bohmian mechanics. Bohm's theory is used for calculating the average time spent by a transmitted particle inside the field region and the arrival-time distributions at the edges of the field region. Using the Runge-Kutta method for the integration of the guidance law, some Bohmian trajectories were also calculated. Numerical results are presented for the special case of a Gaussian wave packet.

**9.    The Power of Unentanglement**  
Scott Aaronson, Salman Beigi, Andrew Drucker, Bill Fefferman, Peter Shor  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0802  
<blockquote>
<p>
The class QMA(k), introduced by Kobayashi et al., consists of all languages that can be verified using k unentangled quantum proofs. Many of the simplest questions about this class have remained embarrassingly open: for example, can we give any evidence that k quantum proofs are more powerful than one? Does QMA(k)=QMA(2) for k>=2? Can QMA(k) protocols be amplified to exponentially small error? In this paper, we make progress on all of the above questions. First, we give a protocol by which a verifier can be convinced that a 3SAT formula of size n is satisfiable, with constant soundness, given ~O(sqrt(n)) unentangled quantum witnesses with O(log n) qubits each. Our protocol relies on the existence of very short PCPs. Second, we show that assuming a weak version of the Additivity Conjecture from quantum information theory, any QMA(2) protocol can be amplified to exponentially small error, and QMA(k)=QMA(2) for all k>=2. Third, we prove the nonexistence of "perfect disentanglers" for simulating multiple Merlins with one.

**10.    A quantum stochastic calculus approach to modeling double-pass atom-field coupling**  
Gopal Sarma, Andrew Silberfarb, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0806  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine a proposal by Sherson and Moelmer to generate polarization-squeezed light in terms of the quantum stochastic calculus (QSC). We investigate the statistics of the output field and confirm their results using the QSC formalism. In addition, we study the atomic dynamics of the system and find that this setup can produce up to 3 dB of atomic spin squeezing.

**11.    Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Exponential Congruences**  
Wim van Dam, Igor E. Shparlinski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1109  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss classical and quantum algorithms for solvability testing and finding integer solutions x,y of equations of the form af^x + bg^y = c over finite fields GF(q). A quantum algorithm with time complexity q^(3/8) (log q)^O(1) is presented. While still superpolynomial in log q, this quantum algorithm is significantly faster than the best known classical algorithm, which has time complexity q^(9/8) (log q)^O(1). Thus it gives an example of a natural problem where quantum algorithms provide about a cubic speed-up over classical ones.

**12.    Quantum Simulations of Classical Annealing Processes**  
R. D. Somma, S. Boixo, H. Barnum, E. Knill  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130504 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1571  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a quantum algorithm that solves combinatorial optimization problems by quantum simulation of a classical simulated annealing process. Our algorithm exploits quantum walks and the quantum Zeno effect induced by evolution randomization. It requires order $1/\sqrt{\delta}$ steps to find an optimal solution with bounded error probability, where $\delta$ is the minimum spectral gap of the stochastic matrices used in the classical annealing process. This is a quadratic improvement over the order $1/\delta$ steps required by the latter.

**13.    Probing the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical resonator using a superconducting qubit II: Implementation**  
M.P. Blencowe, A.D. Armour  
New J. Phys. 10, 095005 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2179  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a possible implementation of the nanomechanical quantum superposition generation and detection scheme described in the preceding, companion paper [Armour A D and Blencowe M P 2008 New. J. Phys. Submitted]. The implementation is based on the circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) set-up, with the addition of a mechanical degree of freedom formed out of a suspended, doubly-clamped segment of the superconducting loop of a dc SQUID located directly opposite the centre conductor of a coplanar waveguide (CPW). The relative merits of two SQUID based qubit realizations are addressed, in particular a capacitively coupled charge qubit and inductively coupled flux qubit. It is found that both realizations are equally promising, with comparable qubit-mechanical resonator mode as well as qubit-microwave resonator mode coupling strengths.

**14.    Non-Markovian effects on the dynamics of entanglement**  
Bruno Bellomo, Rosario Lo Franco, Giuseppe Compagno  
Physical Review Letters 99, 160502 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2377  
<blockquote>
<p>
A procedure that allows to obtain the dynamics of $N$ independent bodies each locally interacting with its own reservoir is presented. It relies on the knowledge of single body dynamics and it is valid for any form of environment noise. It is then applied to the study of non-Markovian dynamics of two independent qubits, each locally interacting with a zero temperature reservoir. It is shown that, although no interaction is present or mediated between the qubits, there is a revival of their entanglement, after a finite period of time of its complete disappearance.

**15.    Operator Imprecision and Scaling of Shor's Algorithm**  
C. Ray Hill, George F. Viamontes  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3076  
<blockquote>
<p>
Shor's algorithm (SA) is a quantum algorithm for factoring integers. Since SA has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA. Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than classical computers.

**16.    Minimum Disturbance Measurement without Post-Selection**  
So-Young Baek, Yong Wook Cheong, Yoon-Ho Kim  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3127  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and demonstrate a linear optical device which deterministically performs optimal quantum measurement or minimum disturbance measurement on a single-photon polarization qubit with the help of an ancillary path qubit introduced to the same photon. We show theoretically and experimentally that this device satisfies the minimum disturbance measurement condition by investigating the relation between the information gain (estimation fidelity) and the state disturbance due to measurement (operation fidelity). Our implementation of minimum disturbance measurement is postselection-free in the sense that all detection events are counted toward evaluation of the estimation fidelity and the operation fidelity, i.e., there is no need for coincidence postselection of the detection events.

**17.    Spacetime path formalism for massive particles of any spin**  
Ed Seidewitz  
Annals Phys.324:309-331,2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3206  
<blockquote>
<p>
Earlier work presented a spacetime path formalism for relativistic quantum mechanics arising naturally from the fundamental principles of the Born probability rule, superposition, and spacetime translation invariance. The resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for a number of previous parameterized approaches to relativistic quantum mechanics in the literature. Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates, rather than as an evolution parameter, such approaches have proved particularly useful in the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. The present paper extends the foundational spacetime path formalism to include massive, nonscalar particles of any (integer or half-integer) spin. This is done by generalizing the principle of translational invariance used in the scalar case to the principle of full Poincare invariance, leading to a formulation for the nonscalar propagator in terms of a path integral over the Poincare group. Once the difficulty of the non-compactness of the component Lorentz group is dealt with, the subsequent development is remarkably parallel to the scalar case. This allows the formalism to retain a clear probabilistic interpretation throughout, with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum mechanics closely related to the well known generalized Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

**18.    Grover's algorithm and human memory**  
Riccardo Franco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3294  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we consider an experimental study showing the influence of emotion regulation strategies on human memory performance: part of such experimental results are difficult to explain within a classic cognitive allocation model. We provide a first attempt to build a model of human memory processes based on a quantum algorithm, the Grover's algorithm, which allows to search a particular item within an unsorted set of items more efficiently than any classic search algorithm. Based on Grover's algorithm paradigm, this new memory model results to have interesting features: it is an iterative process, it uses parallelism and interference effects. Moreover, the strength of such interference effects depends on a parameter of the generalized Grover's algorithm, called the phase, which admits an interpretation in terms of the emotions involved by the items and by the emotion regulation strategies. Thus we show that a reasonable choice of the phase is able to describe correctly the experimental results we consider.

**19.    Narrow-Band Biphoton Generation near Atomic Resonance**  
Shengwang Du, Jianming Wen, Morton H. Rubin  
JOSA B, Vol. 25, Issue 12, pp. C98-C108 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3981  
<blockquote>
<p>
Generating nonclassical light offers a benchmark tool for the fundamental research and potential applications in quantum optics. Conventionally, it has become a standard technique to produce the nonclassical light through the nonlinear optical processes occurring in nonlinear crystals. In this review we describe using cold atomic-gas media to generate such nonclassical light, especially focusing on narrow-band biphoton generation. Compared with the standard procedure, the new biphoton source has such properties as long coherence time, long coherence length, high spectral brightness, and high conversion efficiency. In this paper we concentrate on the theoretical aspect of the entangled two-photon state produced from the four-wave mixing in a multilevel atomic ensemble. We show that both linear and nonlinear optical responses to the generated fields play an important role in determining the biphoton waveform and, consequently on the two-photon temporal correlation. There are two characteristic regimes determined by whether the linear or nonlinear coherence time is dominant. In addition, our model provides a clear physical picture that brings insight into understanding biphoton optics with this new source. We apply our model to recent work on generating narrow-band (and even subnatural linewidth) paired photons using the technique of electromagnetically induced transparency and slow-light effect in cold atoms, and find good agreements with experimental results.

**20.    Matchgates and classical simulation of quantum circuits**  
Richard Jozsa, Akimasa Miyake  
Proc. R. Soc. A 464, 3089-3106 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4050  
<blockquote>
<p>
Let G(A,B) denote the 2-qubit gate which acts as the 1-qubit SU(2) gates A and B in the even and odd parity subspaces respectively, of two qubits. Using a Clifford algebra formalism we show that arbitrary uniform families of circuits of these gates, restricted to act only on nearest neighbour (n.n.) qubit lines, can be classically efficiently simulated. This reproduces a result originally proved by Valiant using his matchgate formalism, and subsequently related by others to free fermionic physics. We further show that if the n.n. condition is slightly relaxed, to allowing the same gates to act only on n.n. and next-n.n. qubit lines, then the resulting circuits can efficiently perform universal quantum computation. From this point of view, the gap between efficient classical and quantum computational power is bridged by a very modest use of a seemingly innocuous resource (qubit swapping). We also extend the simulation result above in various ways. In particular, by exploiting properties of Clifford operations in conjunction with the Jordan-Wigner representation of a Clifford algebra, we show how one may generalise the simulation result above to provide further classes of classically efficiently simulatable quantum circuits, which we call Gaussian quantum circuits.

**21.    The Limiting Distribution of Decoherent Quantum Random Walks**  
Kai Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4311  
<blockquote>
<p>
The behaviors of one-dimensional quantum random walks are strikingly different from those of classical ones. However, when decoherence is involved, the limiting distributions take on many classical features over time. In this paper, we study the decoherence on both position and ``coin'' spaces of the particle. We propose a new analytical approach to investigate these phenomena and obtain the generating functions which encode all the features of these walks. Specifically, from these generating functions, we find exact analytic expressions of several moments for the time and noise dependence of position. Moreover, the limiting position distributions of decoherent quantum random walks are shown to be Gaussian in an analytical manner. These results explicitly describe the relationship between the system and the level of decoherence.

**22.    Coherent states engineering with linear optics: Possible and impossible tasks**  
Bing He, János A. Bergou  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 053818 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4499  
<blockquote>
<p>
The general transformation of the product of coherent states $\prod_{i=1}^N|\alpha_i>$ to the output state $\prod_{i=1}^M|\beta_i>$ ($N=M$ or $N\neq M$), which is realizable with linear optical circuit, is characterized with a linear map from the vector $(\alpha^{\ast}_1,...,\alpha^{\ast}_N)$ to $(\beta^{\ast}_1,...,\beta^{\ast}_M)$. A correspondence between the transformations of a product of coherent states and those of a single photon state is established with such linear maps. It is convenient to apply this linear transformation method to design any linear optical scheme working with coherent states. The examples include message encoding and quantum database searching. The limitation of manipulating entangled coherent states with linear optics is also discussed.

J.Math.Phys.50:062501,2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1360  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider classical particles coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field in the background of a spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe. We find that these particles typically undergo Brownian motion and acquire a non-zero mean squared velocity which depends upon the scale factor of the universe. This Brownian motion can be interpreted as due to non-cancellation of anti-correlated vacuum fluctuations in the time dependent background space-time. We consider several types of coupling to the electromagnetic field, including particles with net electric charge, a magnetic dipole moment, and electric polarizability. We also investigate several different model scale factors.

Solid State Sciences 11, 935 (2009) [special issue on Solid state approaches to quantum information processing and communication]  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2953  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss a technique and a material system that enable the controlled realization of quantum entanglement between spin-wave modes of electron ensembles in two spatially separated pieces of semiconductor material. The approach uses electron ensembles in GaAs quantum wells that are located inside optical waveguides. Bringing the electron ensembles in a quantum Hall state gives selection rules for optical transitions across the gap that can selectively address the two electron spin states. Long-lived superpositions of these electron spin states can then be controlled with a pair of optical fields that form a resonant Raman system. Entangled states of spin-wave modes are prepared by applying quantum-optical measurement techniques to optical signal pulses that result from Raman transitions in the electron ensembles.

**26.    Quantum effects in classical systems having complex energy**  
Carl M. Bender, Dorje C. Brody, Daniel W. Hook  
J.Phys.A41:352003,2008  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4169  
<blockquote>
<p>
On the basis of extensive numerical studies it is argued that there are strong analogies between the probabilistic behavior of quantum systems defined by Hermitian Hamiltonians and the deterministic behavior of classical mechanical systems extended into the complex domain. Three models are examined: the quartic double-well potential $V(x)=x^4-5x^2$, the cubic potential $V(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2-gx^3$, and the periodic potential $V(x)=-\cos x$. For the quartic potential a wave packet that is initially localized in one side of the double-well can tunnel to the other side. Complex solutions to the classical equations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore, classical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and odd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum wave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near the origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability current that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding classical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the periodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can tunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute a localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the energy of the quantum particle lies in a conduction band, then the particle delocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical particle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random walk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle becomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.
