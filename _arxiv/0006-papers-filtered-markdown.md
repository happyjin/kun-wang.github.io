**1.    Fast parallel circuits for the quantum Fourier transform**  
Richard Cleve, John Watrous  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006004  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give new bounds on the circuit complexity of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2^n with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log (n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)^2 log log n) on the circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2^n, for which the best previous bound was O(n^2). As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that factoring is in the complexity class ZPP^BQNC, where BQNC is the class of problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size. Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of epsilon).

**2.    On Arbitrary Phases in Quantum Amplitude Amplification**  
Peter Hoyer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006031  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the use of arbitrary phases in quantum amplitude amplification which is a generalization of quantum searching. We prove that the phase condition in amplitude amplification is given by $\tan(\varphi/2) = \tan(\phi/2)(1-2a)$, where $\phi$ and $\phi$ are the phases used and where $a$ is the success probability of the given algorithm. Thus the choice of phases depends nontrivially and nonlinearly on the success probability. Utilizing this condition, we give methods for constructing quantum algorithms that succeed with certainty and for implementing arbitrary rotations. We also conclude that phase errors of order up to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}$ can be tolerated in amplitude amplification.

**3.    Optical realization of universal quantum cloning**  
Yun-Feng Huang, Wan-Li Li, Chuan-Feng Li, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Yun-Kun Jiang, Guang-Can Guo  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 012315 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006032  
<blockquote>
<p>
Beyond the no-cloning theorem, the universal symmetric quantum cloning machine was first addressed by Buzek and Hillery. Here, we realized the one-to-two qubits Buzek-Hillery cloning machine with linear optical devices. This method relies on the representation of several qubits by a single photon. We showed that, the fidelities between the two output qubits and the original qubit are both 5/6 (which proved to be the optimal fidelity of one-to-two qubits universal cloner) for arbitrary input pure states.

**4.    Efficient Linear Optics Quantum Computation**  
E. Knill, R. Laflamme, G. Milburn  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006088  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the computational power of passive and active linear optical elements and photo-detectors. We show that single photon sources, passive linear optics and photo-detectors are sufficient for implementing reliable quantum algorithms. Feedback from the detectors to the optical elements is required for this implementation. Without feedback, non-deterministic quantum computation is possible. A single photon source sufficient for quantum computation can be built with an active linear optical element (squeezer) and a photo-detector. The overheads associated with using only linear optics appear to be sufficiently low to make quantum computation based on our proposal a viable alternative.

**5.    Novel coherent quantum bit using spatial quantization levels in semiconductor quantum dot**  
L. Fedichkin, M. Yanchenko, K.A. Valiev  
Quantum Computers and Computing 1, 58 (2000)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006097  
<blockquote>
<p>
As basic elements of the quantum computer - quantum bits (qubits) we offer semiconductor quantum dots containing one electron each and consisting each of two tunnel-connected parts. The numerical solution of a Schroedinger equation with the account of Coulomb field of adjacent electrons shows, that in such structures the realization of a full set of basic logic operations which are necessary for fulfillment of quantum computations is possible. Durations of one- and two-qubit operations versus qubit geometry are obtained. Decoherence rates due to spontaneous emission of phonons and acoustic phonons (both piezoelectric and deformation) are evaluated. Analysis of these rates shows the offered qubit to be coherent enough to perform error correction procedures.
