**1.    Experimental teleportation of quantum entanglement with an optimal linear optics Bell-state analyzer**  
Thomas Jennewein, Rupert Ursin, Markus Aspelmeyer, Anton Zeilinger  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409008  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate an experiment on entanglement swapping using an optimal Bell-state measurement capable of identifying two of the four Bell-states for polarization entangled photons, which is the optimum with linear optical elements. The two final photons belong to separately created paris. They are entangled after their original partner photons have been subjected to the Bell state measurement, whose outcome determines the type of entanglement of the final photon pair. The resulting violation of Bell's inequality in both cases confirms the success of the teleportation protocol.

**2.    Convergence of continuous-time quantum walks on the line**  
Alex D. Gottlieb  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409042  
<blockquote>
<p>
The position density of a "particle" performing a continuous-time quantum walk on the integer lattice, viewed on length scales inversely proportional to the time t, converges (as t tends to infinity) to a probability distribution that depends on the initial state of the particle. This convergence behavior has recently been demonstrated for the simplest continuous-time random walk [see quant-ph/0408140]. In this brief report, we use a different technique to establish the same convergence for a very large class of continuous-time quantum walks, and we identify the limit distribution in the general case.

**3.    A functional quantum programming language**  
Thorsten Altenkirch, Jonathan Grattage  
Logic in Computer Science, 2005. Proceedings. 20th Annual IEEE Symposium on, 26-29 June 2005 Page(s):249 - 258  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409065  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the language QML, a functional language for quantum computations on finite types. Its design is guided by its categorical semantics: QML programs are interpreted by morphisms in the category FQC of finite quantum computations, which provides a constructive semantics of irreversible quantum computations realisable as quantum gates. QML integrates reversible and irreversible quantum computations in one language, using first order strict linear logic to make weakenings explicit. Strict programs are free from decoherence and hence preserve superpositions and entanglement - which is essential for quantum parallelism.

**4.    Multiple-time correlation functions for non-Markovian interaction: Beyond the Quantum Regression Theorem**  
Daniel Alonso, In√©s de Vega  
Physical Review Letters 94, 200403 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409098  
<blockquote>
<p>
Multiple time correlation functions are found in the dynamical description of different phenomena. They encode and describe the fluctuations of the dynamical variables of a system. In this paper we formulate a theory of non-Markovian multiple-time correlation functions (MTCF) for a wide class of systems. We derive the dynamical equation of the {\it reduced propagator}, an object that evolve state vectors of the system conditioned to the dynamics of its environment, which is not necessarily at the vacuum state at the initial time. Such reduced propagator is the essential piece to obtain multiple-time correlation functions. An average over the different environmental histories of the reduced propagator permits us to obtain the evolution equations of the multiple-time correlation functions. We also study the evolution of MTCF within the weak coupling limit and it is shown that the multiple-time correlation function of some observables satisfy the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT), whereas other correlations do not. We set the conditions under which the correlations satisfy the QRT. We illustrate the theory in two different cases; first, solving an exact model for which the MTCF are explicitly given, and second, presenting the results of a numerical integration for a system coupled with a dissipative environment through a non-diagonal interaction.

**5.    BDSW protocol revisited: an efficient method for the key distillation without classical computational complexity**  
Xiang-Bin Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409099  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum key distribution(QKD), one can use a classical CSS code to distill the final key. However, there is a constraint for the two codes in CSS code and so far it is unknown how to construct a large CSS code efficiently. Here we show that the BDSW method given by Bennett et al can be modified and the error correction and privacy amplification can be done separately with two INDEPENDENT parity matrices. With such a modification, BDSW method can be used to distill the final key without any classical computational complexity. We also apply the method to the case of imperfect source where a small fraction of signals are tagged by Eve.

**6.    Synchronization of internal and external degrees of freedom of atoms in a standing laser wave**  
V.Yu. Argonov, S.V. Prants  
V.Yu. Argonov and S.V. Prants. Synchronization of internal and external degrees of freedom of atoms in a standing laser wave. Phys. Rev. A. V.71 (2005) 053408.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409108  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider dissipative dynamics of atoms in a strong standing laser wave and find a nonlinear dynamical effect of synchronization between center-of-mass motion and internal Rabi oscillations. The synchronization manifests itself in the phase space as limit cycles which may have different periods and riddled basins of attraction. The effect can be detected in the fluorescence spectra of atoms as equidistant sideband frequencies with the space between adjacent peaks to be inversely proportional to the value of the period of the respective limit cycle. With increasing the intensity of the laser field, we observe numerically cascades of bifurcations that eventually end up in settling a strange chaotic attractor. A broadband noise is shown to destroy a fine structure of the bifurcation scenario, but prominent features of period-1 and period-3 limit cycles survive under a weak noise. The character of the atomic motion is analyzed with the help of the friction force whose zeroes are attractor or repellor points in the velocity space. We find ranges of the laser parameters where the atomic motion resembles a random but deterministic walking of atoms erratically jumping between different wells of the optical potential. Such a random walking is shown to be fractal in the sense that the measured characteristic of the motion, time of exit of atoms from a given space of the standing wave, is a complicated function that has a self-similar structure with singularities on a Cantor set of values of one of the control parameters.

**7.    Quantum Fourier Transform in a Decoherence-Free Subspace**  
Jian-wu Wu, Chun-wen Li, Re-bing Wu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409122  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Fourier transform is of primary importance in many quantum algorithms. In order to eliminate the destructive effects of decoherence induced by couplings between the quantum system and its environment, we propose a robust scheme for quantum Fourier transform over the intrinsic decoherence-free subspaces. The scheme is then applied to the circuit design of quantum Fourier transform over quantum networks under collective decoherence. The encoding efficiency and possible improvements are also discussed.

**8.    Noise resistance of adiabatic quantum computation using random matrix theory**  
Jeremie Roland, Nicolas J. Cerf  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 032330 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409127  
<blockquote>
<p>
Besides the traditional circuit-based model of quantum computation, several quantum algorithms based on a continuous-time Hamiltonian evolution have recently been introduced, including for instance continuous-time quantum walk algorithms as well as adiabatic quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, very little is known today on the behavior of these Hamiltonian algorithms in the presence of noise. Here, we perform a fully analytical study of the resistance to noise of these algorithms using perturbation theory combined with a theoretical noise model based on random matrices drawn from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, whose elements vary in time and form a stationary random process.

**9.    Optimizing linear optics quantum gates**  
J. Eisert  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 040502 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409156  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, the problem of finding optimal success probabilities of static linear optics quantum gates is linked to the theory of convex optimization. It is shown that by exploiting this link, upper bounds for the success probability of networks realizing single-mode gates can be derived, which hold in generality for linear optical networks followed by postselection, i.e., for networks of arbitrary size, any number of auxiliary modes, and arbitrary photon numbers. As a corollary, the previously formulated conjecture is proven that the optimal success probability of a postselected non-linear sign shift without feed-forward is 1/4, a gate playing the central role in the scheme of Knill-Laflamme-Milburn for quantum computation with linear optics. The concept of Lagrange duality is shown to be applicable to provide rigorous proofs for such bounds for elementary gates, although the original problem is a difficult non-convex problem in infinitely many objective variables. The versatility of this approach to identify other optimal linear optical schemes is demonstrated.

**10.    Information Theoretical Approach to Control of Quantum Mechanical Systems**  
Shiro Kawabata  
Phys. Rev. A 68 (2003) 064302  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409187  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fundamental limits on the controllability of quantum mechanical systems are discussed in the light of quantum information theory. It is shown that the amount of entropy-reduction that can be extracted from a quantum system by feedback controller is upper bounded by a sum of the decrease of entropy achievable in open-loop control and the mutual information between the quantum system and the controller. This upper bound sets a fundamental limit on the performance of any quantum controllers whose designs are based on the possibilities to attain low entropy states. An application of this approach pertaining to quantum error correction is also discussed.

**11.    Nonlinear quantum optical computing via measurement**  
G. D. Hutchinson, G. J. Milburn  
Journal of Modern Optics, 20 May 2004 Vol. 51, No. 8, 1211-1222  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0409198  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how the measurement induced model of quantum computation proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel [Phys. Rev. Letts. 86, 5188 (2001)] can be adapted to a nonlinear optical interaction. This optical implementation requires a Kerr nonlinearity, a single photon source, a single photon detector and fast feed forward. Although nondeterministic optical quantum information proposals such as that suggested by KLM [Nature 409, 46 (2001)] do not require a Kerr nonlinearity they do require complex reconfigurable optical networks. The proposal in this paper has the benefit of a single static optical layout with fixed device parameters, where the algorithm is defined by the final measurement procedure.

**12.    One-dimensional continuous-time quantum walks**  
D. ben-Avraham, E. Bollt, C. Tamon  
Quantum Information Processing 3, 295-308 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0409514  
<blockquote>
<p>
We survey the equations of continuous-time quantum walks on simple one-dimensional lattices, which include the finite and infinite lines and the finite cycle, and compare them with the classical continuous-time Markov chains. The focus of our expository article is on analyzing these processes using the Laplace transform on the stochastic recurrences. The resulting time evolution equations, classical versus quantum, are strikingly similar in form, although dissimilar in behavior. We also provide comparisons with analyses performed using spectral methods.
