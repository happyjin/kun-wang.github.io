**1.    Quantum Interleaver: Quantum Error Correction for Burst Error**  
Shiro Kawabata  
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 69 (2000) 3540  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002020  
<blockquote>
<p>
The concept of quantum interleaver and a simple method of quantum burst-error correction is proposed. By using the quantum interleaver, any quantum burst-errors that have occurred spread over the interleaved code word, so that we can construct good quantum burst-error correcting codes without increasing the redundancy of the code. We also discuss the general method of constructing the quantum circuit for the quantum interleaver and the quantum network.

**2.    Superluminal effects for quantum tunneling through two successive barriers**  
Vladislav S.Olkhovsky, Erasmo Recami, Giovanni Salesi  
Europhysics Letters, 57 2002 879-884  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002022  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the phenomenon of one-dimensional non-resonant tunnelling through two successive potential barriers, separated by an intermediate free region R, by analyzing the relevant solutions to the Schroedinger equation. We find that the total traversal time is INDEPENDENT not only of the barrier widths (the so-called "Hartman effect"), but also of the R-width: so that the effective velocity in the region R, between the two barriers, can be regarded as infinite. This agrees with the results known from the corresponding waveguide experiments, which simulated the tunnelling experiment herein considered because of the formal identity between the Schroedinger and the Helmholtz equation [PACS numbers: 73.40.Gk; 03.65.-w; 03.30.+p; 41.20.Jb; 84.40.Az].

**3.    Quantum lower bounds by quantum arguments**  
Andris Ambainis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002066  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new method for proving lower bounds on quantum query algorithms. Instead of a classical adversary that runs the algorithm with one input and then modifies the input, we use a quantum adversary that runs the algorithm with a superposition of inputs. If the algorithm works correctly, its state becomes entangled with the superposition over inputs. We bound the number of queries needed to achieve a sufficient entanglement and this implies a lower bound on the number of queries for the computation. Using this method, we prove two new $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ lower bounds on computing AND of ORs and inverting a permutation and also provide more uniform proofs for several known lower bounds which have been previously proven via variety of different techniques.

**4.    Pressure dependence of the Mg $3s4s^3S_1 \to 3s3p^3P_{0,1,2}$ transition in superfluid $^4$He**  
I. Baumann, A. Breidenassel, C. ZÃ¼hlke, A. Kasimov, G. zu Putlitz, I. Reinhard, K. Jungmann  
Eur. Phys. J. D 12, 117-122 (2000)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002086  
<blockquote>
<p>
The pressure shifts of the $3s4s^3S_1 \to 3s3p^3P_{0,1,2}$ transition of magnesium atoms immersed in superfluid helium have been measured at $(1.3\pm0.1 )$K between saturated vapour pressure and $24 $bar. The wavelength is blue shifted linearly by $(0.07\pm0.01) \frac{nm}{bar}$. This value can be satisfactorily described in the framework of the standard bubble model.
