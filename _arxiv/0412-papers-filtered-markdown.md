**1.    Non-Markovian master equations from entanglement with stationary unobserved degrees of freedom**  
Adrian A. Budini, Henning Schomerus  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38, 9251 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412020  
<blockquote>
<p>
We deduce a class of non-Markovian completely positive master equations which describe a system in a composite bipartite environment, consisting of a Markovian reservoir and additional stationary unobserved degrees of freedom that modulate the dissipative coupling. The entanglement-induced memory effects can persist for arbitrary long times and affect the relaxation to equilibrium, as well as induce corrections to the quantum-regression theorem. By considering the extra degrees of freedom as a discrete manifold of energy levels, strong non-exponential behavior can arise, as for example power law and stretched exponential decays.

**2.    Experimental Test of the Kochen-Specker Theorem for Single Qubits using Positive Operator-Valued Measures**  
Qiang Zhang, Hui Li, Tao Yang, Juan Yin, Jiangfeng Du, Jian-Wei Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412049  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an experimental scheme for the implementation of arbitrary generalized measurements, represented by positive-operator valued measures, on the polarization of single photons, using linear optical devices. Further, we experimentally test a Kochen-Specker theorem for single qubits using positive operator-valued measures. Our experimental results for the first time disprove non-contextual hidden-variable theories, even for single qubits.

**3.    The limitations of nice mutually unbiased bases**  
Michael Aschbacher, Andrew M. Childs, Pawel Wocjan  
Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, Vol. 25, No. 2 (2007) 111-123  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412066  
<blockquote>
<p>
Mutually unbiased bases of a Hilbert space can be constructed by partitioning a unitary error basis. We consider this construction when the unitary error basis is a nice error basis. We show that the number of resulting mutually unbiased bases can be at most one plus the smallest prime power contained in the dimension, and therefore that this construction cannot improve upon previous approaches. We prove this by establishing a correspondence between nice mutually unbiased bases and abelian subgroups of the index group of a nice error basis and then bounding the number of such subgroups. This bound also has implications for the construction of certain combinatorial objects called nets.

**4.    A Unified and Generalized Approach to Quantum Error Correction**  
David Kribs, Raymond Laflamme, David Poulin  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 180501 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412076  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a unified approach to quantum error correction, called operator quantum error correction. This scheme relies on a generalized notion of noiseless subsystems that is not restricted to the commutant of the interaction algebra. We arrive at the unified approach, which incorporates the known techniques -- i.e. the standard error correction model, the method of decoherence-free subspaces, and the noiseless subsystem method -- as special cases, by combining active error correction with this generalized noiseless subsystem method. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum error correction condition from the standard model is a necessary condition for all known methods of quantum error correction.

**5.    A Quantum Langevin Formulation of Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control**  
M.R. James  
J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 7 (2005) S198--S207  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412091  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we formulate a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for continuously monitored open quantum systems modelled by quantum Langevin equations. The optimal controller is expressed in terms of a modified conditional state, which we call a risk-sensitive state, that represents measurement knowledge tempered by the control purpose. One of the two components of the optimal controller is dynamic, a filter that computes the risk-sensitive state. The second component is an optimal control feedback function that is found by solving the dynamic programming equation. The optimal controller can be implemented using classical electronics. The ideas are illustrated using an example of feedback control of a two-level atom.

**6.    Robust Multi-Partite Multi-Level Quantum Protocols**  
Hideomi Nihira, C. R. Stroud Jr  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412097  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a tripartite three-level state that allows a secret sharing protocol among the three parties, or a quantum key distribution protocol between any two parties. The state used in this scheme contains entanglement even after one system is traced out. We show how to utilize this residual entanglement for quantum key distribution purposes, and propose a realization of the scheme using entanglement of orbital angular momentum states of photons.

**8.    Limits on Efficient Computation in the Physical World**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412143  
<blockquote>
<p>
More than a speculative technology, quantum computing seems to challenge our most basic intuitions about how the physical world should behave. In this thesis I show that, while some intuitions from classical computer science must be jettisoned in the light of modern physics, many others emerge nearly unscathed; and I use powerful tools from computational complexity theory to help determine which are which.

**9.    A Study on the Noise Threshold of Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction**  
Y. C. Cheng, R. J. Silbey  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 012320 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412168  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum circuits implementing fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) for the three qubit bit-flip code and five-qubit code are studied. To describe the effect of noise, we apply a model based on a generalized effective Hamiltonian where the system-environment interactions are taken into account by including stochastic fluctuating terms in the system Hamiltonian. This noise model enables us to investigate the effect of noise in quantum circuits under realistic device conditions and avoid strong assumptions such as maximal parallelism and weak storage errors. Noise thresholds of the QEC codes are calculated. In addition, the effects of imprecision in projective measurements, collective bath, fault-tolerant repetition protocols, and level of parallelism in circuit constructions on the threshold values are also studied with emphasis on determining the optimal design for the fault-tolerant QEC circuit. These results provide insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process as well as useful information for designing the optimal fault-tolerant QEC circuit for particular physical implementation of quantum computer.

**10.    Quantum key distribution over 122 km of standard telecom fiber**  
C. Gobby, Z. L. Yuan, A. J. Shields  
Applied Physics Letters 84, 3762-3764(2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the first demonstration of quantum key distribution over a standard telecom fiber exceeding 100 km in length. Through careful optimisation of the interferometer and single photon detector, we achieve a quantum bit error ratio of 8.9% for a 122km link, allowing a secure shared key to be formed after error correction and privacy amplification. Key formation rates of up to 1.9 kbit/sec are achieved depending upon fiber length. We discuss the factors limiting the maximum fiber length in quantum cryptography.

**11.    Characterization of the non-classical nature of conditionally prepared single photons**  
Alfred B. U'Ren, Christine Silberhorn, Jonathan L. Ball, Konrad Banaszek, Ian A. Walmsley  
Phys. Rev. A 72 R021802 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412184  
<blockquote>
<p>
A reliable single photon source is a prerequisite for linear optical quantum computation and for secure quantum key distribution. A criterion yielding a conclusive test of the single photon character of a given source, attainable with realistic detectors, is therefore highly desirable. In the context of heralded single photon sources, such a criterion should be sensitive to the effects of higher photon number contributions, and to vacuum introduced through optical losses, which tend to degrade source performance. In this paper we present, theoretically and experimentally, a criterion meeting the above requirements.

**12.    Quantum Computing, Postselection, and Probabilistic Polynomial-Time**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412187  
<blockquote>
<p>
I study the class of problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer, given the ability to "postselect" on the outcomes of measurements. I prove that this class coincides with a classical complexity class called PP, or Probabilistic Polynomial-Time. Using this result, I show that several simple changes to the axioms of quantum mechanics would let us solve PP-complete problems efficiently. The result also implies, as an easy corollary, a celebrated theorem of Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman that PP is closed under intersection, as well as a generalization of that theorem due to Fortnow and Reingold. This illustrates that quantum computing can yield new and simpler proofs of major results about classical computation.

**13.    Influence of pump-field scattering to nonclassical-light generation in a photonic band-gap nonlinear planar waveguide**  
Jan Perina Jr., Concita Sibilia, Daniela Tricca, Mario Bertolotti  
Physical Review A 71, 043813 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412208  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optical parametric process occurring in a nonlinear planar waveguide can serve as a source of light with nonclassical properties. Properties of the generated fields are substantially modified by scattering of the nonlinearly interacting fields in a photonic band-gap structure inside the waveguide. A quantum model of linear operator amplitude corrections to amplitude mean-values provides conditions for an efficient squeezed-light generation as well as generation of light with sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics. Destructive influence of phase mismatch of the nonlinear interaction can fully be compensated using a suitable photonic-band gap structure inside the waveguide. Also an increase of signal-to-noise ratio of an incident optical field can be reached in the waveguide.

**14.    Spin-orbit interaction of photons and fine splitting of levels in ring dielectric resonator**  
K.Yu. Bliokh, D.Yu. Frolov  
Optics Communications 250, 321-327 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412084  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider eigenmodes of a ring resonator made of a circular dielectric waveguide. Taking into account the polarization corrections, which are responsible for the interaction of polarization and orbital properties of electromagnetic waves (spin-orbit interaction of photons), results in fine splitting of the levels of scalar approximation. The basic features of this fine structure of the levels are similar to that of electron levels in an atom. Namely: 1) sublevels of the fine structure are defined by an additional quantum number: product of helicity of the wave and its orbital moment; 2) for a waveguide with a parabolic profile of the refractive index each level of the scalar approximation splits into N sublevels (N is the principal quantum number), while for any other profile it splits into 2 sublevels; 3) each level of the fine structure remains twice degenerated due to local axial symmetry of the waveguide. Numerical estimations show that the described fine splitting of levels may be observed in optic-fiber ring resonators.
