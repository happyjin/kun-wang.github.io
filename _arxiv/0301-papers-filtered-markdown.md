**1.    Adiabatic Quantum State Generation and Statistical Zero Knowledge**  
Dorit Aharonov, Amnon Ta-Shma  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301023  
<blockquote>
<p>
The design of new quantum algorithms has proven to be an extremely difficult task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of 'quantum state generation'. This approach provides intriguing links between many different areas: quantum computation, adiabatic evolution, analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians, rapidly mixing Markov chains, the complexity class statistical zero knowledge, quantum random walks, and more. We first show that many natural candidates for quantum algorithms can be cast as a state generation problem. We define a paradigm for state generation, called 'adiabatic state generation' and develop tools for adiabatic state generation which include methods for implementing very general Hamiltonians and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps. We use our tools to prove that adiabatic state generation is equivalent to state generation in the standard quantum computing model, and finally we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.

**2.    Checking $2 \times M$ separability via semidefinite programming**  
Hugo J. Woerdeman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301058  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we propose a sequence of tests which gives a definitive test for checking $2\times M$ separability. The test is definitive in the sense that each test corresponds to checking membership in a cone, and that the closure of the union of all these cones consists exactly of {\it all} $2 \times M$ separable states. Membership in each single cone may be checked via semidefinite programming, and is thus a tractable problem. This sequential test comes about by considering the dual problem, the characterization of all positive maps acting ${\mathbb C}^{2 \times 2} \to {\mathbb C}^{M\times M}$. The latter in turn is solved by characterizing all positive quadratic matrix polynomials in a complex variable.

**3.    Quantum nondemolition measurement of a single electron spin in a quantum dot**  
Mitsuro Sugita, Susumu Machida, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301064  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for the quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of a single electron spin in a single quantum dot (QD). Analytical expressions are obtained for the optical Faraday effect between a quantum dot exciton and microcavity field. The feasibility of the QND measurement of a single electron spin is discussed for a GaAs/AlAs microcavity with an InAs QD.

**4.    Stochastic Simulation of Grover's Algorithm**  
L.R.U. Manssur, R. Portugal  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301077  
<blockquote>
<p>
We simulate Grover's algorithm in a classical computer by means of a stochastic method using the Hubbard-Stratonovich decomposition of n-qubit gates into one-qubit gates integrated over auxiliary fields. The problem reduces to finding the fixed points of the associated system of Langevin differential equations. The equations are obtained automatically for any number of qubits by employing a computer algebra program. We present the numerical results of the simulation for a small search space.

**5.    Grover's Algorithm: Quantum Database Search**  
C. Lavor, L.R.U. Manssur, R. Portugal  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301079  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review Grover's algorithm by means of a detailed geometrical interpretation and a worked out example. Some basic concepts of Quantum Mechanics and quantum circuits are also reviewed. This work is intended for non-specialists which have basic knowledge on undergraduate Linear Algebra.

**6.    Exact quantum Fourier transforms and discrete logarithm algorithms**  
Michele Mosca, Christof Zalka  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301093  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how the quantum fast Fourier transform (QFFT) can be made exact for arbitrary orders (first for large primes). For most quantum algorithms only the quantum Fourier transform of order $2^n$ is needed, and this can be done exactly. Kitaev \cite{kitaev} showed how to approximate the Fourier transform for any order. Here we show how his construction can be made exact by using the technique known as ``amplitude amplification''. Although unlikely to be of any practical use, this construction e.g. allows to make Shor's discrete logarithm quantum algorithm exact. Thus we have the first example of an exact non black box fast quantum algorithm, thereby giving more evidence that ``quantum'' need not be probabilistic. We also show that in a certain sense the family of circuits for the exact QFFT is uniform. Namely the parameters of the gates can be calculated efficiently.

**7.    Input states for quantum gates**  
A. Gilchrist, W.J. Munro, A.G. White  
Physical Review A 67, 040304 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301112  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine three possible implementations of non-deterministic linear optical cnot gates with a view to an in-principle demonstration in the near future. To this end we consider demonstrating the gates using currently available sources such as spontaneous parametric down conversion and coherent states, and current detectors only able to distinguish between zero or many photons. The demonstration is possible in the co-incidence basis and the errors introduced by the non-optimal input states and detectors are analysed.

**8.    Decoherence in Discrete Quantum Walks**  
Viv Kendon, Ben Tregenna  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301182  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an introduction to coined quantum walks on regular graphs, which have been developed in the past few years as an alternative to quantum Fourier transforms for underpinning algorithms for quantum computation. We then describe our results on the effects of decoherence on these quantum walks on a line, cycle and hypercube. We find high sensitivity to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of decoherence can be to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms, such as fast mixing times to uniform distributions.
