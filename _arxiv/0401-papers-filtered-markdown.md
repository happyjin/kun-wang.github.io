**1.    Conditional implementation of a quantum phase gate with distant atoms trapped in different optical cavities**  
XuBo Zou, W. Mathis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401042  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for conditional implementation of a quantum phase gate by using distant atoms trapped in different optical cavities. Instead of direct interaction between atoms, the present scheme makes use of quantum interference of polarized photons decaying from the optical cavities to conditionally create the desired quantum phase gate between two distant atoms. The proposed scheme only needs linear optical elements and a two-fold coincidence detection, and are insensitive to the quantum noise. The scheme can be directly used to prepare any quantum state of many distant atoms.

**2.    Non-Markovian dynamics in a spin star system: Exact solution and approximation techniques**  
Heinz-Peter Breuer, Daniel Burgarth, Francesco Petruccione  
Physical Review B 70, 045323 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401051  
<blockquote>
<p>
The reduced dynamics of a central spin coupled to a bath of N spin-1/2 particles arranged in a spin star configuration is investigated. The exact time evolution of the reduced density operator is derived, and an analytical solution is obtained in the limit of an infinite number of bath spins, where the model shows complete relaxation and partial decoherence. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the central spin cannot be treated within the Born-Markov approximation. The Nakajima-Zwanzig and the time-convolutionless projection operator technique are applied to the spin star system. The performance of the corresponding perturbation expansions of the non-Markovian equations of motion is examined through a comparison with the exact solution.

**3.    Spectra of Quantized Walks and a $\sqrt{δε}$ rule**  
Mario Szegedy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401053  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce quantized bipartite walks, compute their spectra, generalize the algorithms of Grover \cite{g} and Ambainis \cite{amb03} and interpret them as quantum walks with memory. We compare the performance of walk based classical and quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general. Let $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i ,j\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that the set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\epsilon n$. The goal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds. Our model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can generate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically, by request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for the cost of $\wp_{0}$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element $i$ into the black box we can obtain a random element $j$, where $j$ is distributed according to $P[i,j]$. The cost of the latter operation is $\wp_{1}$. Finally, we can use the black box to test if an element $i$ is marked, and this costs us $\wp_{2}$. If $\delta$ is the eigenvalue gap of $P$, there is a simple classical algorithm with cost $O(\wp_{0} + (\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\delta\epsilon)$ that solves the above promise problem. (The algorithm is efficient if $\wp_{0}$ is much larger than $\wp_{1}+\wp_{2}$.) In contrast,we show that for the ``quantized'' version of the algorithm it costs only $O(\wp_{0} + (\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\sqrt{\delta\epsilon})$ to solve the problem. We refer to this as the $\sqrt{\delta\epsilon}$ rule. Among the technical contributions we give a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections.

**5.    Is Quantum Mechanics An Island In Theoryspace?**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401062  
<blockquote>
<p>
This recreational paper investigates what happens if we change quantum mechanics in several ways. The main results are as follows. First, if we replace the 2-norm by some other p-norm, then there are no nontrivial norm-preserving linear maps. Second, if we relax the demand that norm be preserved, we end up with a theory that allows rapid solution of PP-complete problems (as well as superluminal signalling). And third, if we restrict amplitudes to be real, we run into a difficulty much simpler than the usual one based on parameter-counting of mixed states.

**6.    Three and Four-Body Interactions in Spin-Based Quantum Computers**  
Ari Mizel, Daniel A. Lidar  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 077903 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401081  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the effort to design and to construct a quantum computer, several leading proposals make use of spin-based qubits. These designs generally assume that spins undergo pairwise interactions. We point out that, when several spins are engaged mutually in pairwise interactions, the quantitative strengths of the interactions can change and qualitatively new terms can arise in the Hamiltonian, including four-body interactions. In parameter regimes of experimental interest, these coherent effects are large enough to interfere with computation, and may require new error correction or avoidance techniques.

**7.    Measured Quantum Fourier Transform of 1024 Qubits on Fiber Optics**  
Akihisa Tomita, Kazuo Nakamura  
Int. J. Quantum Information, vol. 2 pp.119-131 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401100  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a key function to realize quantum computers. A QFT followed by measurement was demonstrated on a simple circuit based on fiber-optics. The QFT was shown to be robust against imperfections in the rotation gate. Error probability was estimated to be 0.01 per qubit, which corresponded to error-free operation on 100 qubits. The error probability can be further reduced by taking the majority of the accumulated results. The reduction of error probability resulted in a successful QFT demonstration on 1024 qubits.

**8.    Suppression of Spin Projection Noise in Broadband Atomic Magnetometry**  
J.M. Geremia, John K. Stockton, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401107  
<blockquote>
<p>
Our 2005 Physical Review Letter entitled "Suppression of Spin-Projection Noise in Broadband Atomic Magnetometry" (volume 94, 203002) relied heavily in its claims of experimental quantum-limited performance on the results of a prior publication from our group [1]. In subsequent work we have determined that the results of [1] were incorrect and must therefore retract this Physical Review Letter as well. The authors would like to emphasize that the broadband magnetometry approach taken in our work remains valid, as described in the theoretical paper [2], but we have lost confidence in the calibration procedures employed at the time to establish sensitivity relative to the spin-projection noise level.

**9.    Finite Supersymmetry Transformations**  
Nevena Ilieva, Heide Narnhofer, Walter Thirring  
Eur.Phys.J.C35:119-127,2004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401139  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate simple examples of supersymmetry algebras with real and Grassmann parameters. Special attention is payed to the finite supertransformations and their probability interpretation. Furthermore we look for combinations of bosons and fermions which are invariant under supertransformations. These combinations correspond to states that are highly entangled.

**10.    Mechanism and Lineshapes of Sub-Fourier Resonances**  
Hans Lignier, Jean Claude Garreau, Pascal Szriftgiser, Dominique Delande  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401152  
<blockquote>
<p>
Subtle internal interference effects allow quantum-chaotic systems to display "sub-Fourier" resonances, i.e. to distinguish two neighboring driving frequencies in a time shorter than the inverse of the difference of the two frequencies. We report experiments on the atomic version of the kicked rotor showing the unusual properties of the sub-Fourier resonances, and develop a theoretical approach (based on the Floquet theorem) explaining these properties, and correctly predicting the widths and lineshapes.

**11.    Theory confronts experiment in the Casimir force measurements: quantification of errors and precision**  
F. Chen, G. L. Klimchitskaya, U. Mohideen, V. M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. A, v.69, N2, p.022117-(1-11), 2004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401153  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare theory and experiment in the Casimir force measurement between gold surfaces performed with the atomic force microscope. Both random and systematic experimental errors are found leading to a total absolute error equal to 8.5 pN at 95% confidence. In terms of the relative errors, experimental precision of 1.75% is obtained at the shortest separation of 62 nm at 95% confidence level (at 60% confidence the experimental precision of 1% is confirmed at the shortest separation). An independent determination of the accuracy of the theoretical calculations of the Casimir force and its application to the experimental configuration is carefully made. Special attention is paid to the sample-dependent variations of the optical tabulated data due to the presence of grains, contribution of surface plasmons, and errors introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem. Nonmultiplicative and diffraction-type contributions to the surface roughness corrections are examined. The electric forces due to patch potentials resulting from the polycrystalline nature of the gold films are estimated. The finite size and thermal effects are found to be negligible. The theoretical accuracy of about 1.69% and 1.1% are found at a separation 62 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Within the limits of experimental and theoretical errors very good agreement between experiment and theory is confirmed characterized by the root mean square deviation of about 3.5 pN within all measurement range. The conclusion is made that the Casimir force is stable relative to variations of the sample-dependent optical and electric properties, which opens new opportunities to use the Casimir effect for diagnostic purposes.

**12.    Jump-like unravelings for non-Markovian open quantum systems**  
Jay Gambetta, T. Askerud, H. M. Wiseman  
Phys. Rev. A 69, 052104 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401171  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian evolution of an open quantum system can be `unraveled' into pure state trajectories generated by a non-Markovian stochastic (diffusive) Schr\"odinger equation, as introduced by Di\'osi, Gisin, and Strunz. Recently we have shown that such equations can be derived using the modal (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this paper we generalize this theory to treat jump-like unravelings. To illustrate the jump-like behavior we consider a simple system: A classically driven (at Rabi frequency $\Omega$) two-level atom coupled linearly to a three mode optical bath, with a central frequency equal to the frequency of the atom, $\omega_0$, and the two side bands have frequencies $\omega_0\pm\Omega$. In the large $\Omega$ limit we observed that the jump-like behavior is similar to that observed in this system with a Markovian (broad band) bath. This is expected as in the Markovian limit the fluorescence spectrum for a strongly driven two level atom takes the form of a Mollow triplet. However the length of time for which the Markovian-like behaviour persists depends upon {\em which} jump-like unraveling is used.

**13.    Estimating mixing properties of local Hamiltonian dynamics and continuous quantum random walks is PSPACE-hard**  
Pawel Wocjan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401184  
<blockquote>
<p>
A major topic of (classical) ergodic theory is to examine qualitatively how the phase space of dynamical systems is penetrated by the orbits of their dynamics. We consider interacting qubit systems with dynamics according to 4-local Hamiltonians and continuous quantum random walks. For these systems one could use the von Neumann entropy of the time-average to characterize the mixing properties of the corresponding orbits, i.e., what portion of the state space and how uniformly it is filled out by the orbits. We show that the problem of estimating this entropy is PSPACE-hard.
