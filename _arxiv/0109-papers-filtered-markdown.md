**1.    ROM-based computation: quantum versus classical**  
B.C. Travaglione, M.A. Nielsen, H.M. Wiseman, A. Ambainis  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 2, No. 4 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109016  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a model of computation based on read only memory (ROM), which allows us to compare the space-efficiency of reversible, error-free classical computation with reversible, error-free quantum computation. We show that a ROM-based quantum computer with one writable qubit is universal, whilst two writable bits are required for a universal classical ROM-based computer. We also comment on the time-efficiency advantages of quantum computation within this model.

**2.    Universal simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics for qudits**  
Michael A. Nielsen, Michael J. Bremner, Jennifer L. Dodd, Andrew M. Childs, Christopher M. Dawson  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 022317 (2002)

<blockquote>
<p>
What interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a composite quantum system? Dodd et al. (quant-ph/0106064) provided a partial solution to this problem in the form of an efficient algorithm to simulate any desired two-body Hamiltonian evolution using any fixed two-body entangling N-qubit Hamiltonian, and local unitaries. We extend this result to the case where the component systems have D dimensions. As a consequence we explain how universal quantum computation can be performed with any fixed two-body entangling N-qudit Hamiltonian, and local unitaries.

**3.    Implementing the quantum random walk**  
B. C. Travaglione, G. J. Milburn  
Physical Review A, Vol 65, 032310 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109076  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, several groups have investigated quantum analogues of random walk algorithms, both on a line and on a circle. It has been found that the quantum versions have markedly different features to the classical versions. Namely, the variance on the line, and the mixing time on the circle increase quadratically faster in the quantum versions as compared to the classical versions. Here, we propose a scheme to implement the quantum random walk on a line and on a circle in an ion trap quantum computer. With current ion trap technology, the number of steps that could be experimentally implemented will be relatively small. However, we show how the enhanced features of these walks could be observed experimentally. In the limit of strong decoherence, the quantum random walk tends to the classical random walk. By measuring the degree to which the walk remains `quantum', this algorithm could serve as an important benchmarking protocol for ion trap quantum computers.

**4.    Quantum machine language and quantum computation with Josephson junctions**  
K. Ch. Chatzisavvas, C. Daskaloyannis, C. P. Panos  
Quantum Computers and Computing, v.4, No2, p.93 (2003);Proceedings of the XXII Solvay Conference on Physics-The Physics of Communication, World Scientific Publishing, p.589 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109098  
<blockquote>
<p>
An implementation method of a gate in a quantum computer is studied in terms of a finite number of steps evolving in time according to a finite number of basic Hamiltonians, which are controlled by on-off switches. As a working example, the case of a particular implementation of the two qubit computer employing a simple system of two coupled Josephson junctions is considered. The binary values of the switches together with the time durations of the steps constitute the quantum machine language of the system.

**5.    Demonstration of Non-Deterministic Quantum Logic Operations using Linear Optical Elements**  
T. B. Pittman, B. C. Jacobs, J. D. Franson  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 257902 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109128  
<blockquote>
<p>
Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn recently showed that non-deterministic quantum logic operations could be performed using linear optical elements, additional photons (ancilla), and post-selection based on the output of single-photon detectors [Nature 409, 46 (2001)]. Here we report the experimental demonstration of two logic devices of this kind, a destructive controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and a quantum parity check. These two devices can be combined with a pair of entangled photons to implement a conventional (non-destructive) CNOT that succeeds with a probability of 1/4.

**6.    Exact results for accepting probabilities of quantum automata**  
Andris Ambainis, Arnolds Kikusts  
Theoretical Computer Science, 295(2003):3-25  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109136  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the properties of Kondacs-Watrous model of quantum finite automata (QFA) is that the probability of the correct answer for a QFA cannot be amplified arbitrarily. In this paper, we determine the maximum probabilities achieved by QFAs for several languages. In particular, we show that any language that is not recognized by an RFA (reversible finite automaton) can be recognized by a QFA with probability at most 0.7726...

**7.    Optimizing Completely Positive Maps using Semidefinite Programming**  
K. Audenaert, B. De Moor  
Phys.Rev.A (65), 030302 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0109155  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, a lot of attention has been devoted to finding physically realisable operations that realise as closely as possible certain desired transformations between quantum states, e.g. quantum cloning, teleportation, quantum gates, etc. Mathematically, this problem boils down to finding a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) linear map that maximizes the (mean) fidelity between the map itself and the desired transformation. In this note we want to draw attention to the fact that this problem belongs to the class of so-called semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. As SDP problems are convex, it immediately follows that they do not suffer from local optima. Furthermore, this implies that the numerical optimization of the CPTP map can, and should, be done using methods from the well-established SDP field, as these methods exploit convexity and are guaranteed to converge to the real solution. Finally, we show how the duality inherent to convex and SDP problems can be exploited to prove analytically the optimality of a proposed solution. We give an example of how to apply this proof method by proving the optimality of Hardy and Song's proposed solution for the universal qubit $\theta$-shifter (quant-ph/0102100).
