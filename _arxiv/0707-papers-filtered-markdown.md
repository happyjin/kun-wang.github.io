**1.    Reliable Final Computational Results from Faulty Quantum Computation**  
Gerald Gilbert, Michael Hamrick, Yaakov S. Weinstein  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0008  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we extend both standard fault tolerance theory and Kitaev's model for quantum computation, combining them so as to yield quantitative results that reveal the interplay between the two. Our analysis establishes a methodology that allows us to quantitatively determine design parameters for a quantum computer, the values of which ensure that an overall computation of interest yields a correct *final result* with some prescribed probability of success, as opposed to merely ensuring that the desired *final quantum state* is obtained. As a specific example of the practical application of our approach, we explicitly calculate the number of levels of error correction concatenation needed to achieve a correct final result for the overall computation with some prescribed success probability. Since our methodology allows one to determine parameters required in order to achieve the correct final result for the overall quantum computation, as opposed to merely ensuring that the desired final quantum state is produced, our method enables the determination of complete quantum computational resource requirements associated to the actual solution of practical problems.

**2.    Experimental demonstration of continuous variable purification of squeezed states**  
A. Franzen, B. Hage, J. DiGuglielmo, J. Fiurasek, R. Schnabel  
Phys. Rev. Lett 97, 150505 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0149  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on the first experimental demonstration of purification of nonclassical continuous variable states. The protocol uses two copies of phase-diffused states overlapped on a beam splitter and provides Gaussified, less mixed states with the degree of squeezing improved. The protocol uses only linear optical devices such as beam splitters and homodyne detection, thereby proving these optical elements can be used for successful purification of this type of state decoherence which occurs in optical transmission channels.

**3.    Non-Markovian quantum dynamics and the method of correlated projection superoperators**  
Heinz-Peter Breuer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0172  
<blockquote>
<p>
Efficient methods for the description of the non-Markovian dynamics of open systems play an important role in many proposed applications of quantum mechanics. Here we review some of the most important tools that are based on the projection operator techniques of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The standard product-state projection is generalized to a new class of correlated projection superoperators that allow the treatment of strong memory effects, and lead to a non-Markovian generalization of the Lindblad equation.

**4.    Fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computing with small-amplitude coherent states**  
A. P. Lund, T. C. Ralph, H. L. Haselgrove  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0327  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computing using two optical coherent states as qubit basis states has been suggested as an interesting alternative to single photon optical quantum computing with lower physical resource overheads. These proposals have been questioned as a practical way of performing quantum computing in the short term due to the requirement of generating fragile diagonal states with large coherent amplitudes. Here we show that by using a fault-tolerant error correction scheme, one need only use relatively small coherent state amplitudes ($\alpha > 1.2$) to achieve universal quantum computing. We study the effects of small coherent state amplitude and photon loss on fault tolerance within the error correction scheme using a Monte Carlo simulation and show the quantity of resources used for the first level of encoding is orders of magnitude lower than the best known single photon scheme. %We study this reigem using a Monte Carlo simulation and incorporate %the effects of photon loss in this simulation.

**5.    Implementation of three-qubit Grover search in cavity QED**  
W.L. Yang, C.Y. Chen, M. Feng  
Phys. Rev. A 76 054301 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0334  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using resonant interaction of three Rydberg atoms with a single-mode microwave cavity, we consider a realization of three-qubit Grover search algorithm in the presence of weak cavity decay, based on a previous idea for three-qubit quantum gate [Phys. Rev. A 73, 064304 (2006)]. We simulate the searching process under the influence of the cavity decay and show that our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find the marked state with high fidelity. The required operations are very close to the reach with current cavity QED techniques.

**6.    Robust and efficient generator of almost maximal multipartite entanglement**  
Davide Rossini, Giuliano Benenti  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 060501 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0451  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum chaotic maps can efficiently generate pseudo-random states carrying almost maximal multipartite entanglement, as characterized by the probability distribution of bipartite entanglement between all possible bipartitions of the system. We show that such multipartite entanglement is robust, in the sense that, when realistic noise is considered, distillable entanglement of bipartitions remains almost maximal up to a noise strength that drops only polynomially with the number of qubits.

**7.    Symmetrised Characterisation of Noisy Quantum Processes**  
Joseph Emerson, Marcus Silva, Osama Moussa, Colm Ryan, Martin Laforest, Jonathan Baugh, David G. Cory, Raymond Laflamme  
Science 317, 1893-1896 (2007).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0685  
<blockquote>
<p>
A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum systems is to realise their potential as quantum computers. Probably the most significant obstacle in this direction is the problem of "decoherence": the extreme fragility of quantum systems to environmental noise and other control limitations. The theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction has shown that quantum computation is possible even in the presence of decoherence provided that the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain well-defined theoretical conditions. However, existing methods for noise characterisation have become intractable already for the systems that are controlled in today's labs. In this paper we introduce a technique based on symmetrisation that enables direct experimental characterisation of key properties of the decoherence affecting a multi-body quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required by existing methods from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the application of this technique to the optimisation of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.

**8.    Realization of quantum walks with negligible decoherence in waveguide lattices**  
Hagai B. Perets, Yoav Lahini, Francesca Pozzi, Marc Sorel, Roberto Morandotti, Yaron Silberberg  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 170506 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0741  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks are the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, and were recently studied in the context of quantum computation. A quantum random walker is subject to self interference, leading to a remarkably different behavior than that of classical random walks such as ballistic propagation or localization due to disorder. Physical implementations of quantum walks have only been made in very small scale systems severely limited by decoherence. Here we show that the propagation of photons in waveguide lattices, which have been studied extensively in recent years, are essentially an implementation of quantum walks. Since waveguide lattices are easily constructed at large scales and display negligible decoherence, they can serve as an ideal and versatile experimental playground for the study of quantum walks and quantum algorithms. We experimentally observe quantum walks in large systems (~100 sites) and confirm quantum walks effects which were studied theoretically, including ballistic propagation, disorder and boundary related effects.

**9.    Optimal state in the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme of linear optical teleportation**  
Andrzej Grudka, Joanna Modlawska  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 014301 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0759  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss some properties of the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme for quantum teleportation with both maximally and nonmaximally entangled states. We derive the error correction scheme when one performs teleportation with nonmaximally entangled states and we find the probability for perfect teleportation. We show that the maximally entangled state is optimal in such a case. We also show how the error correction scheme can be implemented experimentally when one uses polarization encoding.

**10.    Randomized Benchmarking of Quantum Gates**  
E. Knill, D. Leibfried, R. Reichle, J. Britton, R. B. Blakestad, J. D. Jost, C. Langer, R. Ozeri, S. Seidelin, D. J. Wineland  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0963  
<blockquote>
<p>
A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized pi/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.

**11.    Grover's algorithm based multi-qubit secret sharing scheme**  
Arti Chamoli, C. M. Bhandari  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1042  
<blockquote>
<p>
Some of the secret sharing schemes having unique quantum features like parallelism and entanglement are supposed to be relatively secure. Different schemes proposed by various researchers over the years have features which could be specific to the nature and need of a situation. Following Hsu's proposed scheme we propose a secret sharing scheme using Grover's search algorithm for a four qubit system with several marked states. Further, the scheme has been generalised to an n-qubit syatem.

J. Fitzsimons, J. Twamley

<p>
We describe a method to execute globally controlled quantum information processing which admits a fault tolerant quantum error correction scheme. Our scheme nominally uses three species of addressable two-level systems which are arranged in a one dimensional array in a specific periodic arrangement. We show that the scheme possesses a fault tolerant error threshold.

**13.    Fluorescence during Doppler cooling of a single trapped atom**

Phys. Rev. A, 76, 053416 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1314  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the temporal dynamics of Doppler cooling of an initially hot single trapped atom in the weak binding regime using a semiclassical approach. We develop an analytical model for the simplest case of a single vibrational mode for a harmonic trap, and show how this model allows us to estimate the initial energy of the trapped particle by observing the fluorescence rate during the cooling process. The experimental implementation of this temperature measurement provides a way to measure atom heating rates by observing the temperature rise in the absence of cooling. This method is technically relatively simple compared to conventional sideband detection methods, and the two methods are in reasonable agreement. We also discuss the effects of RF micromotion, relevant for a trapped atomic ion, and the effect of coupling between the vibrational modes on the cooling dynamics.

**14.    The quadratic speedup in Grover's search algorithm from the entanglement perspective**  
Pranaw Rungta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1410  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the role played by entanglement in the dynamical evolution of Grover's search algorithm in the space of qubits. We show that the algorithm can be equivalently described as an iterative change of the entanglement between the qubits, which governs the evolution of the initial state towards the target state, and where the entanglement can be quantified in terms a single entanglement monotone. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the quadratic speedup, which illustrates how the change in the bipartite entanglement of the state after each iteration determines the corresponding increase in the probability of finding the target state. This allows us to reestablish from the entanglement perspective that Grover's search algorithm is the only optimal pure state search algorithm.

**15.    Simplified motional heating rate measurements of trapped ions**

Phys. Rev. A 76, 033411 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1528  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have measured motional heating rates of trapped atomic ions, a factor that can influence multi-ion quantum logic gate fidelities. Two simplified techniques were developed for this purpose: one relies on Raman sideband detection implemented with a single laser source, while the second is even simpler and is based on time-resolved fluorescence detection during Doppler recooling. We applied these methods to determine heating rates in a microfrabricated surface-electrode trap made of gold on fused quartz, which traps ions 40 microns above its surface. Heating rates obtained from the two techniques were found to be in reasonable agreement. In addition, the trap gives rise to a heating rate of 300 plus or minus 30 per second for a motional frequency of 5.25 MHz, substantially below the trend observed in other traps.

**16.    Interference of multi-mode photon echoes generated in spatially separated solid-state atomic ensembles**  
M. U. Staudt, M. Afzelius, H. de Riedmatten, S. R. Hastings-Simon, C. Simon, R. Ricken, H. Suche, W. Sohler, N. Gisin  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 173602 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1814  
<blockquote>
<p>
High-visibility interference of photon echoes generated in spatially separated solid-state atomic ensembles is demonstrated. The solid state ensembles were LiNbO$_3$ waveguides doped with Erbium ions absorbing at 1.53 $\mu$m. Bright coherent states of light in several temporal modes (up to 3) are stored and retrieved from the optical memories using two-pulse photon echoes. The stored and retrieved optical pulses, when combined at a beam splitter, show almost perfect interference, which demonstrates both phase preserving storage and indistinguishability of photon echoes from separate optical memories. By measuring interference fringes for different storage times, we also show explicitly that the visibility is not limited by atomic decoherence. These results are relevant for novel quantum repeaters architectures with photon echo based multimode quantum memories.

**17.    Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit coupled to an Ising spin bath**  
Hari Krovi, Ognyan Oreshkov, Mikhail Ryazanov, Daniel A. Lidar  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 052117 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2096  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the analytically solvable Ising model of a single qubit system coupled to a spin bath. The purpose of this study is to analyze and elucidate the performance of Markovian and non-Markovian master equations describing the dynamics of the system qubit, in comparison to the exact solution. We find that the time-convolutionless master equation performs particularly well up to fourth order in the system-bath coupling constant, in comparison to the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation. Markovian approaches fare poorly due to the infinite bath correlation time in this model. A recently proposed post-Markovian master equation performs comparably to the time-convolutionless master equation for a properly chosen memory kernel, and outperforms all the approximation methods considered here at long times. Our findings shed light on the applicability of master equations to the description of reduced system dynamics in the presence of spin-baths.

**18.    Non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of noisy continuous variable quantum channels**  
Jun-Hong An, Wei-Min Zhang  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 042127 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2278  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the entanglement dynamics of continuous-variable quantum channels in terms of an entangled squeezed state of two cavity fields in a general non-Markovian environment. Using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional theory in the coherent-state representation, we derive an exact master equation with time-dependent coefficients reflecting the non-Markovian influence of the environment. The influence of environments with different spectral densities, e.g., Ohmic, sub-Ohmic, and super-Ohmic, is numerically studied. The non-Markovian process shows its remarkable influences on the entanglement dynamics due to the sensitive time-dependence of the dissipation and noise functions within the typical time scale of the environment. The Ohmic environment shows a weak dissipation-noise effect on the entanglement dynamics, while the sub-Ohmic and super-Ohmic environments induce much more severe noise. In particular, the memory of the system interacting with the environment contributes a strong decoherence effect to the entanglement dynamics in the super-Ohmic case.

The proposed effect opens novel opportunities in nanotechnology to actuate the periodic movement in electro- and optomechanical micromachines based entirely on the zero-point oscillations of the quantum vacuum without the action of mechanical springs.

**20.    Independent Noise Approximation for Spin-Boson Decoherence**  
Man-Hong Yung  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2779  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction is a solution to preserve the fidelity of quantum information encoded in physical systems subject to noise. However, unfavorable correlated errors could be induced even for non-interacting qubits through the environment (bath), when they are "packed" together. The question is, to what extent can we treat the noise induced by the bath as independent? In the context of the spin-boson model, we show that, under some reasonable constraints, the independent noise approximation could be valid. On the other hand, in the strongly correlated limit, we show how the method of decoherence free subspace can be made applicable. Combining these two methods makes fault-tolerant quantum computation promising in fighting against correlated errors.

Phys. Rev. A 76, 042334 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3284  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a geometric approach to the characterization of separability and entanglement in pure Gaussian states of an arbitrary number of modes. The analysis is performed adapting to continuous variables a formalism based on single subsystem unitary transformations that has been recently introduced to characterize separability and entanglement in pure states of qubits and qutrits [arXiv:0706.1561]. In analogy with the finite-dimensional case, we demonstrate that the $1 \times M$ bipartite entanglement of a multimode pure Gaussian state can be quantified by the minimum squared Euclidean distance between the state itself and the set of states obtained by transforming it via suitable local symplectic (unitary) operations. This minimum distance, corresponding to a, uniquely determined, extremal local operation, defines a novel entanglement monotone equivalent to the entropy of entanglement, and amenable to direct experimental measurement with linear optical schemes.

<p>
A fiber taper waveguide is used to perform direct optical spectroscopy of a microdisk-quantum-dot system, exciting the system through the photonic (light) channel rather than the excitonic (matter) channel. Strong coupling, the regime of coherent quantum interactions, is demonstrated through observation of vacuum Rabi splitting in the transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity. The fiber coupling method also allows the examination of the system's steady-state nonlinear properties, where saturation of the cavity-QD response is observed for less than one intracavity photon.

Phys. Rev. A 76, 062709 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4335  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the transport properties of multiple-particle quantum states in a class of one-dimensional systems with a single quantum impurity. In these systems, the local interaction at the quantum impurity induces strong and non-trivial correlations between the multi-particles. We outline an exact theoretical approach, based upon real-space equations of motion and the Bethe ansatz, that allows one to construct the full scattering matrix (S-matrix) for these systems. In particular, we emphasize the need for completeness check upon the eigenstates of the S-matrix, when these states obtained from Bethe Ansatz are used for describing the scattering properties. As a detailed example of our approach, we solve the transport properties of two photons incident on a single two-level atom, when the photons are restricted to a one-dimensional system such as a photonic crystal waveguide. Our approach predicts a number of novel nonlinear effects involving only two photons, including background fluorescence, spatial attraction and repulsion between the photons, as well as the emergence of a two-photon bound state.

We introduce a planar waveguide of constant width with non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Robin boundary conditions. We study the spectrum of this system in the regime when the boundary coupling function is a compactly supported perturbation of a homogeneous coupling. We prove that the essential spectrum is positive and independent of such perturbation, and that the residual spectrum is empty. Assuming that the perturbation is small in the supremum norm, we show that it gives rise to real weakly-coupled eigenvalues converging to the threshold of the essential spectrum. We derive sufficient conditions for these eigenvalues to exist or to be absent. Moreover, we construct the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of these eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3985  
<blockquote>
<p>
Tunnelling of material particles through a classically impenetrable barrier constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction, intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling, individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.

The physics of the attractive one-dimensional Bose gas (Lieb-Liniger model) is investigated with techniques based on the integrability of the system.

Our results thus provide quantitative predictions for possible future experiments in atomic gases or optical waveguides.

The experimental demonstration of the modification of the Casimir force between a gold coated sphere and a single-crystal Si membrane by light pulses is performed. The specially designed and fabricated Si membrane was irradiated with 514 nm laser pulses of 5 ms width in high vacuum leading to a change of the charge-carrier density. The difference in the Casimir force in the presence and in the absence of laser radiation was measured by means of an atomic force microscope as a function of separation at different powers of the absorbed light. The total experimental error of the measured force differences at a separation of 100 nm varies from 10 to 20% in different measurements. The experimental results are compared with theoretical computations using the Lifshitz theory at both zero and laboratory temperatures. The total theoretical error determined mostly by the uncertainty in the concentration of charge carriers when the light is incident is found to be about 14% at separations less than 140 nm. The experimental data are consistent with the Lifshitz theory at laboratory temperature, if the static dielectric permittivity of high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is assumed to be finite. If the dc conductivity of high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is included into the model of dielectric response, the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature is shown to be experimentally inconsistent at 95% confidence. The demonstrated phenomenon of the modification of the Casimir force through a change of the charge-carrier density is topical for applications of the Lifshitz theory to real materials in fields ranging from nanotechnology and condensed matter physics to the theory of fundamental interactions.
