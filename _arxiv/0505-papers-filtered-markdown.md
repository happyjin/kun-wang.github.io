**1.    Investigation of the Casimir force between metal and semiconductor test bodies**  
F. Chen, U. Mohideen, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. A, v.72, 020101(R) (2005).

<blockquote>
<p>
The measurement of the Casimir force between a large gold coated sphere and single crystal silicon plate is performed with an atomic force microscope. A rigorous statistical comparison of data with theory is done, without use of the concept of root-mean-square deviation, and excellent agreement is obtained. The Casimir force between metal and semiconductor is demonstrated to be significantly different than between two similar or dissimilar metals.

**2.    Nonlinear Quantum Dynamics**  
Salman Habib, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Andrew Doherty, Benjamin Greenbaum, Asa Hopkins, Kurt Jacobs, Hideo Mabuchi, Keith Schwab, Kosuke Shizume, Daniel Steck, Bala Sundaram

<blockquote>
<p>
The vast majority of the literature dealing with quantum dynamics is concerned with linear evolution of the wave function or the density matrix. A complete dynamical description requires a full understanding of the evolution of measured quantum systems, necessary to explain actual experimental results. The dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear even at the level of distribution functions, both classically as well as quantum mechanically. Aside from being physically more complete, this treatment reveals the existence of dynamical regimes, such as chaos, that have no counterpart in the linear case. Here, we present a short introductory review of some of these aspects, with a few illustrative results and examples.

**3.    Optimal photons for quantum information processing**  
Peter P. Rohde, Timothy C. Ralph, Michael A. Nielsen  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 052332 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505139  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic quantum information processing schemes, such as linear optics quantum computing, and other experiments relying on single-photon interference, inherently require complete photon indistinguishability to enable the desired photonic interactions to take place. Mode-mismatch is the dominant cause of photon distinguishability in optical circuits. Here we study the effects of photon wave-packet shape on tolerance against the effects of mode-mismatch in linear optical circuits, and show that Gaussian distributed photons with large bandwidth are optimal. The result is general and holds for arbitrary linear optical circuits, including ones which allow for post-selection and classical feed-forward.

**4.    Quantum Error Correction in Spatially Correlated Quantum Noise**  
Rochus Klesse, Sandra Frank  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 230503 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505153  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum error correction of quantum-noise that is created by a local interaction of qubits with a common bosonic bath. The possible exchange of bath bosons between qubits gives rise to spatial and temporal correlations in the noise. We find that these kind of noise correlations have a strong negative impact on quantum error correction.

**5.    Quantum Information Processing Without Joint Measurement**  
Ming Yang, Zhuo-Liang Cao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505160  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a linear optical scheme for the teleportation of unknown ionic states, the entanglement concentration for nonmaximally entangled states for ions via entanglement swapping and the remote preparation for ionic entangled states. The unique advantage of the scheme is that the joint Bell-state measurement needed in the previous schemes is not needed in the current scheme, i.e. the joint Bell-state measurement has been converted into the product of separate measurements on single ions and photons. In addition, the current scheme can realize the quantum information processes for ions by using linear optical elements, which simplify the implementation of quantum information processing for ions.

**6.    Nanoscale atomic waveguides with suspended carbon nanotubes**  
V. Peano, M. Thorwart, A. Kasper, R. Egger  
Appl. Phys. B 81, 1075-1080 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505210  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimentally viable setup for the realization of one-dimensional ultracold atom gases in a nanoscale magnetic waveguide formed by single doubly-clamped suspended carbon nanotubes. We show that all common decoherence and atom loss mechanisms are small guaranteeing a stable operation of the trap. Since the extremely large current densities in carbon nanotubes are spatially homogeneous, our proposed architecture allows to overcome the problem of fragmentation of the atom cloud. Adding a second nanowire allows to create a double-well potential with a moderate tunneling barrier which is desired for tunneling and interference experiments with the advantage of tunneling distances being in the nanometer regime.

**7.    Non-Markovian dynamics of double quantum dot charge qubits due to acoustic phonons**  
M.Thorwart, J.Eckel, E.R.Mucciolo  
Phys. Rev. B. 72, 235320 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0505621  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamics of a double quantum dot charge qubit which is coupled to piezoelectric acoustic phonons, appropriate for GaAs heterostructures. At low temperatures, the phonon bath induces a non-Markovian dynamical behavior of the oscillations between the two charge states of the double quantum dot. Upon applying the numerically exact quasiadiabatic propagator path-integral scheme, the reduced density matrix of the charge qubit is calculated, thereby avoiding the Born-Markov approximation. This allows a systematic study of the dependence of the Q-factor on the lattice temperature, on the size of the quantum dots, as well as on the interdot coupling. We calculate the Q-factor for a recently realized experimental setup and find that it is two orders of magnitudes larger than the measured value, indicating that the decoherence due to phonons is a subordinate mechanism.
