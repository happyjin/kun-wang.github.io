**1.    Continuous variable methods in relativistic quantum information: Characterisation of quantum and classical correlations of scalar field modes in noninertial frames**  
Gerardo Adesso, Sammy Ragy, Davide Girolami  
Class. Quantum Grav. 29 (2012) 224002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0222  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review a recently introduced unified approach to the analytical quantification of correlations in Gaussian states of bosonic scalar fields by means of Renyi-2 entropy. This allows us to obtain handy formulae for classical, quantum, total correlations, as well as bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We apply our techniques to the study of correlations between two modes of a scalar field as described by observers in different states of motion. When one or both observers are in uniform acceleration, the quantum and classical correlations are degraded differently by the Unruh effect, depending on which mode is detected. Residual quantum correlations, in the form of quantum discord without entanglement, may survive in the limit of an infinitely accelerated observer Rob, provided they are revealed in a measurement performed by the inertial Alice.

**2.    Quantum resources for hybrid communication via qubit-oscillator states**  
Tommaso Tufarelli, Davide Girolami, Ruggero Vasile, Sougato Bose, Gerardo Adesso  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 052326 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0251  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a family of qubit-oscillator states as resources for hybrid quantum communication. They result from a mechanism of qubit-controlled displacement on the oscillator. For large displacements, we obtain analytical formulas for entanglement and other nonclassical correlations, such as entropic and geometric discord, in those states. We design two protocols for quantum communication using the considered resource states, a hybrid teleportation and a hybrid remote state preparation. The latter, in its standard formulation, is shown to have a performance limited by the initial mixedness of the oscillator, echoing the behaviour of the geometric discord. If one includes a further optimization over non-unitary correcting operations performed by the receiver, the performance is improved to match that of teleportation, which is directly linked to the amount of entanglement. Both protocols can then approach perfect efficiency even if the oscillator is originally highly thermal. We discuss the critical implications of these findings for the interpretation of general quantum correlations.

**3.    Quantum Search Algorithms on Hierarchical Networks**  
F. L. Marquezino, R. Portugal, S. Boettcher  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0529  
<blockquote>
<p>
The "abstract search algorithm" is a well known quantum method to find a marked vertex in a graph. It has been applied with success to searching algorithms for the hypercube and the two-dimensional grid. In this work we provide an example for which that method fails to provide the best algorithm in terms of time complexity. We analyze search algorithms in degree-3 hierarchical networks using quantum walks driven by non-groverian coins. Our conclusions are based on numerical simulations, but the hierarchical structures of the graphs seems to allow analytical results.

**4.    Property Testing of Quantum Measurements**  
Guoming Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0828  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study the following question: given a black box performing some unknown quantum measurement on a multi-qudit system, how do we test whether this measurement has certain property or is far away from having this property. We call this task \textit{property testing} of quantum measurement. We first introduce a metric for quantum measurements, and show that it possesses many nice features. Then we show that, with respect to this metric, the following classes of measurements can be efficiently tested: 1. the stabilizer measurements, which play a crucial role for quantum error correction; 2. the $k$-local measurements, i.e. measurements whose outcomes depend on a subsystem of at most $k$ qudits; 3. the permutation-invariant measurements, which include those measurements used in quantum data compression, state estimation and entanglement concentration. In fact, all of them can be tested with query complexity independent of the system's dimension. Furthermore, we also present an algorithm that can test any finite set of measurements. Finally, we consider the following natural question: given two black-box measurement devices, how do we estimate their distance? We give an efficient algorithm for this task, and its query complexity is also independent of the system's dimension. As a consequence, we can easily test whether two unknown measurements are identical or very different.

**5.    Precisely timing dissipative quantum information processing**  
M. J. Kastoryano, M. M. Wolf, J. Eisert  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 110501 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0985  
<blockquote>
<p>
Dissipative engineering constitutes a framework within which quantum information processing protocols are powered by system-environment interaction rather than by unitary dynamics alone. This framework embraces noise as a resource, and consequently, offers a number of advantages compared to one based on unitary dynamics alone, e.g., that the protocols are typically independent of the initial state of the system. However, the time independent nature of this scheme makes it difficult to imagine precisely timed sequential operations, conditional measurements or error correction. In this work, we provide a path around these challenges, by introducing basic dissipative gadgets which allow us to precisely initiate, trigger and time dissipative operations, while keeping the system Liouvillian time-independent. These gadgets open up novel perspectives for thinking of timed dissipative quantum information processing. As an example, we sketch how measurement based computation can be simulated in the dissipative setting.

**6.    PPT-indistinguishable states via semidefinite programming**  
Alessandro Cosentino  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 012321 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1031  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a simple semidefinite program whose optimal value is equal to the maximum probability of perfectly distinguishing orthogonal maximally entangled states using any PPT measurement (a measurement whose operators are positive under partial transpose). When the states to be distinguished are given by the tensor product of Bell states, the semidefinite program simplifies to a linear program. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020506 (2012) -- arXiv:1107.3224v1], Yu, Duan and Ying exhibit a set of 4 maximally entangled states in $C^4 \otimes C^4$, which is distinguishable by any PPT measurement only with probability strictly less than 1. Using semidefinite programming, we show a tight bound of 7/8 on this probability (3/4 for the case of unambiguous PPT measurements). We generalize this result by demonstrating a simple construction of a set of k states in $C^k \otimes C^k$ with the same property, for any k that is a power of 2. Finally, by running numerical experiments, we obtain some non-trivial results about the PPT-distinguishability of certain interesting sets of generalized Bell states in $C^5 \otimes C^5$ and $C^6 \otimes C^6$.

**7.    Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Entanglement in the Middle**  
Christian Weedbrook  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 022308 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1497  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the performance of continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols where the entangled source originates not from one of the trusted parties, Alice or Bob, but from the malicious eavesdropper in the middle. This is in contrast to the typical simulations where Alice creates the entangled source and sends it over an insecure quantum channel to Bob. By using previous techniques and identifying certain error correction protocol equivalences, we show that Alice and Bob do not need to trust their source, and can still generate a positive key rate. Such a situation can occur in a quantum network where the untrusted source originated in between the two users.

**8.    Simple quantum error detection and correction for superconducting qubits**  
Kyle Keane, Alexander N. Korotkov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1836  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze simple quantum error detection and quantum error correction protocols relevant to current experiments with superconducting qubits. We show that for qubits with energy relaxation the repetitive N-qubit codes cannot be used for quantum error correction, but can be used for quantum error detection. In the latter case it is sufficient to use only two qubits for the encoding. In the analysis we demonstrate a useful technique of unraveling the qubit energy relaxation into "relaxation" and "no relaxation" scenarios. Also, we propose and numerically analyze several two-qubit algorithms for quantum error detection/correction, which can be readily realized at the present-day level of the phase qubit technology.

**9.    Increasing the dimensionality of quantum walks using multiple walkers**  
Peter P. Rohde, Andreas Schreiber, Martin Stefanak, Igor Jex, Alexei Gilchrist, Christine Silberhorn  
Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 10, 1644 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1850  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that with the addition of multiple walkers, quantum walks on a line can be transformed into lattice graphs of higher dimension. Thus, multi-walker walks can simulate single-walker walks on higher dimensional graphs and vice versa. This exponential complexity opens up new applications for present-day quantum walk experiments. We discuss the applications of such higher-dimensional structures and how they relate to linear optics quantum computing. In particular we show that multi-walker quantum walks are equivalent to the BosonSampling model for linear optics quantum computation proposed by Aaronson & Arkhipov. With the addition of control over phase-defects in the lattice, which can be simulated with entangling gates, asymmetric lattice structures can be constructed which are universal for quantum computation.

**10.    Multi-qubit parity measurement in circuit quantum electrodynamics**  
David P. DiVincenzo, Firat Solgun  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1910  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a concept for performing direct parity measurements on three or more qubits in microwave structures with superconducting resonators coupled to Josephson-junction qubits. We write the quantum-eraser conditions that must be fulfilled for the parity measurements as requirements for the scattering phase shift of our microwave structure. We show that these conditions can be fulfilled with present-day devices. We present one particular scheme, implemented with two-dimensional cavity techniques, in which each qubit should be coupled equally to two different microwave cavities. The magnitudes of the couplings that are needed are in the range that has been achieved in current experiments. A quantum calculation indicates that the measurement is optimal if the scattering signal can be measured with near single photon sensitivity. A comparison with an extension of a related proposal from cavity optics is presented. We present a second scheme, for which a scalable implementation of the four-qubit parities of the surface quantum error correction code can be envisioned. It uses three-dimensional cavity structures, using cavity symmetries to achieve the necessary multiple resonant modes within a single resonant structure.

**11.    Reduced equations of motion for quantum systems driven by diffusive Markov processes**  
Mohan Sarovar, Matthew D. Grace  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 130401 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2178  
<blockquote>
<p>
The expansion of a stochastic Liouville equation for the coupled evolution of a quantum system and an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process into a hierarchy of coupled differential equations is a useful technique that simplifies the simulation of stochastically-driven quantum systems. We expand the applicability of this technique by completely characterizing the class of diffusive Markov processes for which a useful hierarchy of equations can be derived. The expansion of this technique enables the examination of quantum systems driven by non-Gaussian stochastic processes with bounded range. We present an application of this extended technique by simulating Stark-tuned F\"orster resonance transfer in Rydberg atoms with non-perturbative position fluctuations.

**12.    Model checking quantum Markov chains**  
Yuan Feng, Nengkun Yu, Mingsheng Ying  
Journal of Computer and System Sciences 2013, 79, 1181-1198  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2187  
<blockquote>
<p>
Although the security of quantum cryptography is provable based on the principles of quantum mechanics, it can be compromised by the flaws in the design of quantum protocols and the noise in their physical implementations. So, it is indispensable to develop techniques of verifying and debugging quantum cryptographic systems. Model-checking has proved to be effective in the verification of classical cryptographic protocols, but an essential difficulty arises when it is applied to quantum systems: the state space of a quantum system is always a continuum even when its dimension is finite. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel notion of quantum Markov chain, specially suited to model quantum cryptographic protocols, in which quantum effects are entirely encoded into super-operators labelling transitions, leaving the location information (nodes) being classical. Then we define a quantum extension of probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) and develop a model-checking algorithm for quantum Markov chains.

**13.    Background-free quantum frequency conversion of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot**  
Serkan Ates, Imad Agha, Antonio Badolato, Kartik Srinivasan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2218  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate background-free quantum frequency conversion of single photons from an epitaxially-grown InAs quantum dot. Single photons at \approx 980 nm are combined with a pump laser near 1550 nm inside a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide, generating single photons at \approx 600 nm. The large red-detuning between the pump and signal wavelengths ensures nearly background-free conversion, avoiding processes such as upconversion of anti-Stokes Raman scattered pump photons in the PPLN crystal. Second-order correlation measurements on the single photon stream are performed both before and after conversion, confirming the preservation of photon statistics during the frequency conversion process.

**14.    A novel vortex generator and mode converter for electrons**  
Peter Schattschneider, Michael Stoeger-Pollach, Johan Verbeeck  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2329  
<blockquote>
<p>
A mode converter for electron vortex beams is described. Numerical simulations, confirmed by experiment, show that the converter transforms a vortex beam with topological charge $m=\pm 1$ into beams closely resembling Hermite-Gaussian HG$_{10}$ and HG$_{01}$ modes. The converter can be used as a mode discriminator or filter for electron vortex beams. Combining the converter with a phase plate turns a plane wave into modes with topological charge $m=\pm 1$. This combination serves as a generator of electron vortex beams of high brilliance.

**15.    Optical wavelength conversion via optomechanical coupling in a silica resonator**  
Chunhua Dong, Victor Fiore, Mark C. Kuzyk, Lin Tian, Hailin Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2360  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the experimental demonstration of converting coherent optical fields between two different optical wavelengths by coupling two optical modes to a mechanical breathing mode in a silica resonator. The experiment is based on an itinerant approach, in which state-mapping from optical to mechanical and from mechanical to another optical state takes place simultaneously. In contrast to conventional nonlinear optical processes, optomechanical impedance matching as well as efficient optical input-output coupling, instead of phase-matching, plays a crucial role in optomechanics-based wavelength conversion.

**16.    Hyperentanglement-enabled Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics**  
Trent M. Graham, Julio T. Barreiro, Masoud Mohseni, Paul G. Kwiat  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 060404 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2587  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use hyperentangled photons to experimentally implement an entanglement-assisted quantum process tomography technique known as Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics. Specifically, hyperentanglement-assisted Bell-state analysis enabled us to characterize a variety of single-qubit quantum processes using far fewer experimental configurations than are required by Standard Quantum Process Tomography (SQPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate how known errors in Bell-state measurement may be compensated for in the data analysis. Using these techniques, we have obtained single-qubit process fidelities as high as 98.2% but with one-third the number experimental configurations required for SQPT. Extensions of these techniques to multi-qubit quantum processes are discussed.

**17.    Scale invariance of entanglement dynamics in Grover's quantum search algorithm**

Phys. Rev. A 87, 022331 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3000  
<blockquote>
<p>
We calculate the amount of entanglement of the multiqubit quantum states employed in the Grover algorithm, by following its dynamics at each step of the computation. We show that genuine multipartite entanglement is always present. Remarkably, the dynamics of any type of entanglement as well as of genuine multipartite entanglement is independent of the number n of qubits for large n, thus exhibiting a scale invariance property. We compare this result with the entanglement dynamics induced by a fixed-point quantum search algorithm. We also investigate criteria for efficient simulatability in the context of Grover's algorithm.

Ephraim Shahmoon, Gershon Kurizki  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 033831 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3064  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that nonradiative interactions between atomic dipoles placed in a waveguide can give rise to deterministic entanglement at ranges much larger than their resonant wavelength. The range increases as the dipole-resonance approaches the waveguide's cutoff frequency, caused by the giant density of photon modes near cutoff, a regime where the standard (perturbative) Markov approximation fails. We provide analytical theories for both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, supported by numerical simulations, and discuss possible experimental realizations.

**19.    Universal computation by multi-particle quantum walk**  
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset, Zak Webb  
Science 339, 791-794 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3782  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum-mechanical process on a graph defined by analogy to classical random walk. The quantum walker is a particle that moves from a given vertex to adjacent vertices in quantum superposition. Here we consider a generalization of quantum walk to systems with more than one walker. A continuous-time multi-particle quantum walk is generated by a time-independent Hamiltonian with a term corresponding to a single-particle quantum walk for each particle, along with an interaction term. Multi-particle quantum walk includes a broad class of interacting many-body systems such as the Bose-Hubbard model and systems of fermions or distinguishable particles with nearest-neighbor interactions. We show that multi-particle quantum walk is capable of universal quantum computation. Since it is also possible to efficiently simulate a multi-particle quantum walk of the type we consider using a universal quantum computer, this model exactly captures the power of quantum computation. In principle our construction could be used as an architecture for building a scalable quantum computer with no need for time-dependent control.

**20.    Matrix Product State representation for Slater Determinants and Configuration Interaction States**  
Pietro Silvi, Davide Rossini, Rosario Fazio, Giuseppe E. Santoro, Vittorio Giovannetti  
Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 27, 1245029 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4154  
<blockquote>
<p>
Slater determinants are product states of filled quantum fermionic orbitals. When they are expressed in a configuration space basis chosen a priori, their entanglement is bound and controlled. This suggests that an exact representation of Slater determinants as finitely-correlated states is possible. In this paper we analyze this issue and provide an exact Matrix Product representation for Slater determinant states. We also argue possible meaningful extensions that embed more complex configuration interaction states into the description.

**21.    On the equivalence between sharing quantum and classical secrets, and error correction**  
Anne Marin, Damian Markham  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 042332 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4182  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general scheme for sharing quantum secrets, and an extension to sharing classical secrets, which contain all known quantum secret sharing schemes. In this framework we show the equivalence of existence of both schemes, that is, the existence of a scheme sharing a quantum secret implies the extended classical secret sharing scheme works, and vice versa. As a consequence of this we find new schemes sharing classical secrets for arbitrary access structures. We then clarify the relationship to quantum error correction and observe several restrictions thereby imposed, which for example indicates that for pure state threshold schemes the share size $q$ must scale with the number of players $n$ as $q\geq \sqrt{n}$. These results also provide a new way of searching for quantum error correcting codes.

Integrated quantum photonics is an appealing platform for quantum information processing, quantum communication and quantum metrology.

Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable controlled two-qubit operation on a chip using a multiwaveguide interferometer with a tunable phase shifter. We find excellent agreement between theory and experiment, with a 0.98 \pm 0.02 average similarity between measured and ideal operations.

<p>
Erasing quantum-mechanical distinguishability is of fundamental interest and also of practical importance, particularly in subject areas related to quantum information processing. We demonstrate a method applicable to optical systems in which single-mode filtering is used with only linear optical instruments to achieve quantum indistinguishability. Through "heralded" Hong-Ou-Mandel interference experiments we measure and quantify the improvement of indistinguishability between single photons generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in optical fibers. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with predictions of a quantum-multimode theory we develop for such systems, without the need for any fitting parameter.

**25.    Chaotic walking and fractal scattering of atoms in a tilted optical lattice**  
S.V. Prants, V.O. Vitkovsky  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4372  
<blockquote>
<p>
Chaotic walking of cold atoms in a tilted optical lattice, created by two counter propagating running waves with an additional external field, is demonstrated theoretically and numerically in the semiclassical and Hamiltonian approximations. The effect consists in random-like changing the direction of atomic motion in a rigid lattice under the influence of a constant force due to a specific behavior of the atomic dipole-moment component that changes abruptly in a random-like manner while atoms cross standing-wave nodes. Chaotic walking generates a fractal-like scattering of atoms that manifests itself in a self-similar structure of the scattering function in the atom-field detuning, position and momentum spaces. The probability distribution function of the scattering time is shown to decay in a non-exponential way with a power-law tail.

<p>
We study the influence of particle interaction on a quantum walk on a bipartite one-dimensional lattice with decay from every second site. The corresponding non-interacting (linear) system has been shown to have a topological transition described by the average displacement before decay. Here we use this topological quantity to distinguish coherent quantum dynamics from incoherent classical dynamics caused by a breaking of the translational symmetry. We furthermore analyze the behavior by means of a rate equation providing a quantitative description of the incoherent nonlinear dynamics.

<p>
We introduce a $W^*$-metric space, which is a particular approach to non-commutative metric spaces where a \textit{quantum metric} is defined on a von Neumann algebra. We generalize the notion of a quantum code and quantum error correction to the setting of finite dimensional $W^*$-metric spaces, which includes codes and error correction for classical finite metric spaces. We also introduce a class of $W^*$-metric spaces that come from representations of semi-simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ called \textit{$\mathfrak{g}$-metric} spaces, and present an outline for code constructions. In turn, we produce specific code constructions for $\mathfrak{su}(2,\mathbb{C})$-metric spaces that depend upon proving Tverberg's theorem for points on a moment curve constructed from arithmetic sequences. We introduce a \textit{quantum distance distribution}, and we prove an analogue of the MacWilliam's identities for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-metric spaces.

J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 361 (2012) 012021  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4519  
<blockquote>
<p>
In our bouncer-walker model a quantum is a nonequilibrium steady-state maintained by a permanent throughput of energy. Specifically, we consider a "particle" as a bouncer whose oscillations are phase-locked with those of the energy-momentum reservoir of the zero-point field (ZPF), and we combine this with the random-walk model of the walker, again driven by the ZPF. Starting with this classical toy model of the bouncer-walker we were able to derive fundamental elements of quantum theory. Here this toy model is revisited with special emphasis on the mechanism of emergence. Especially the derivation of the total energy hbar.omega and the coupling to the ZPF are clarified. For this we make use of a sub-quantum equipartition theorem. It can further be shown that the couplings of both bouncer and walker to the ZPF are identical. Then we follow this path in accordance with previous work, expanding the view from the particle in its rest frame to a particle in motion. The basic features of ballistic diffusion are derived, especially the diffusion constant D, thus providing a missing link between the different approaches of our previous works.

<p>
We study the interplay between forgetful and memory-keeping evolution enforced on a two-level system by a multi-spin environment whose elements are coupled to local bosonic baths. Contrarily to the expectation that any non-Markovian effect would be buried by the forgetful mechanism induced by the spin-bath coupling, one can actually induce a full Markovian-to-non-Markovian transition of the two-level system's dynamics, controllable by parameters such as the mismatch between the energy of the two-level system and of the spin environment. For a symmetric coupling, the amount of non-Markovianity surprisingly grows with the number of decoherence channels.

This papers underscores the intimate connection between the quantum walks generated by certain spin chain Hamiltonians and classical birth and death processes.

As an application, we present a characterization of spin systems for which the probability to return to the point of origin at some time is 1 or almost 1.

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally generate arbitrary time-bin qubits using continuous-wave light. The advantage unique to our qubit is its compatibility with deterministic continuous-variable quantum information processing. This compatibility comes from its optical coherence with continuous waves, well-defined spatio-temporal mode, and frequency spectrum within the operational bandwidth of the current continuous-variable technology. We also demonstrate an efficient scheme to characterize time-bin qubits via eight-port homodyne measurement. This enables the complete characterization of the qubits as two-mode states, as well as a flexible analysis equivalent to the conventional scheme based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and photon-detection.

<p>
The initial proposal for scalable optical quantum computing required single photon sources, linear optical elements such as beamsplitters and phaseshifters, and photon detection. Here we demonstrate a two qubit gate using indistinguishable photons from a quantum dot in a pillar microcavity. As the emitter, the optical circuitry, and the detectors are all semiconductor, this is a promising approach towards creating a fully integrated device for scalable quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dynamical properties of dissipative continuous-time quantum walks on directed graphs. Using a large-deviation approach we construct a thermodynamic formalism allowing us to define a dynamical order parameter, and to identify transitions between dynamical regimes. For a particular class of dissipative quantum walks we propose a quantum generalization of the the classical PageRank vector, used to rank the importance of nodes in a directed graph. We also provide an example where one can characterize the dynamical transition from an effective classical random walk to a dissipative quantum walk as a thermodynamic crossover between distinct dynamical regimes.

<blockquote>
<p>
By use of the two measures presented recently, the indivisibility and the backflow of information, we study the non-Markovianity of the dynamics for a two-level system interacting with a zero-temperature structured environment without using rotating wave approximation (RWA). In the limit of weak coupling between the system and the reservoir, and by expanding the time-convolutionless (TCL) generator to the forth order with respect to the coupling strength, the time-local non-Markovian master equation for the reduced state of the system is derived. Under the secular approximation, the exact analytic solution is obtained and the sufficient and necessary conditions for the indivisibility and the backflow of information for the system dynamics are presented. In the more general case, we investigate numerically the properties of the two measures for the case of Lorentzian reservoir. Our results show the importance of the counter-rotating terms to the short-time-scale non-Markovian behavior of the system dynamics, further expose the relations between the two measures and their rationality as non-Markovian measures. Finally, the complete positivity of the dynamics of the considered system is discussed.

<p>
Knowledge of the dynamical behavior of correlations with no classical counterpart, like entanglement, nonlocal correlations and quantum discord, in open quantum systems is of primary interest because of the possibility to exploit these correlations for quantum information tasks. Here we review some of the most recent results on the dynamics of correlations in bipartite systems embedded in non-Markovian environments that, with their memory effects, influence in a relevant way the system dynamics and appear to be more fundamental than the Markovian ones for practical purposes. Firstly, we review the phenomenon of entanglement revivals in a two-qubit system for both independent environments and a common environment. We then consider the dynamics of quantum discord in non-Markovian dephasing channel and briefly discuss the occurrence of revivals of quantum correlations in classical environments.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance have provided the possibility for large scale quantum computations without a detrimental loss of quantum information. A very natural class of gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation is the Clifford gate set and as such their usefulness for universal quantum computation is of great interest. Clifford group gates augmented by magic state preparation give the possibility of simulating universal quantum computation. However, experimentally one cannot expect to perfectly prepare magic states. Nonetheless, it has been shown that by repeatedly applying operations from the Clifford group and measurements in the Pauli basis, the fidelity of noisy prepared magic states can be increased arbitrarily close to a pure magic state [1]. We investigate the robustness of magic state distillation to perturbations of the initial states to arbitrary locations in the Bloch sphere due to noise. Additionally, we consider a depolarizing noise model on the quantum gates in the decoding section of the distillation protocol and demonstrate its effect on the convergence rate and threshold value. Finally, we establish that faulty magic state distillation is more efficient than fault-tolerance-assisted magic state distillation at low error rates due to the large overhead in the number of quantum gates and qubits required in a fault-tolerance architecture. The ability to perform magic state distillation with noisy gates leads us to conclude that this could be a realistic scheme for future small-scale quantum computing devices as fault-tolerance need only be used in the final steps of the protocol.

Simulation methods based on stochastic realizations of state vector evolutions are commonly used tools to solve open quantum system dynamics, both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regime.

We generalize Markovian quantum trajectory methods in the sense of deriving an exact analytical WTD for non-Markovian quantum dynamics and show explicitly how to construct this distribution for certain commonly used quantum optical systems.

<p>
We study the implementation of quantum state transfer protocols in phonon networks, where in analogy to optical networks, quantum information is transmitted through propagating phonons in extended mechanical resonator arrays or phonon waveguides. We describe how the problem of a non-vanishing thermal occupation of the phononic quantum channel can be overcome by implementing optomechanical multi- and continuous mode cooling schemes to create a 'cold' frequency window for transmitting quantum states. In addition, we discuss the implementation of phonon circulators and switchable phonon routers, which rely on strong coherent optomechanical interactions only, and do not require strong magnetic fields or specific materials. Both techniques can be applied and adapted to various physical implementations, where phonons coupled to spin or charge based qubits are used for on-chip networking applications.

**40.    Dephasing by a Continuous-Time Random Walk Process**  
Daniel M Packwood, Yoshitaka Tanimura  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0296  
<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic treatments of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy require evaluations of functions like <exp(i int_0^t Q(s)ds)>, where t is time, Q(s) is the value of a stochastic process at time s, and the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging. This paper gives an exact evaluation of these functions for the case where Q is a continuous-time random walk process. The continuous time random walk describes an environment that undergoes slow, step-like changes in time. It also has a well-defined Gaussian limit, and so allows for non-Gaussian and Gaussian stochastic dynamics to be studied within a single framework. We apply the results to extract qubit-lattice interaction parameters from dephasing data of P-doped Si semiconductors (data collected elsewhere), and to calculate the two-dimensional spectrum of a three level harmonic oscillator undergoing random frequency modulations.

<blockquote>
<p>
For a given set of input-output pairs of quantum states or observables, we ask the question whether there exists a physically implementable transformation that maps each of the inputs to the corresponding output. The physical maps on quantum states are trace-preserving completely positive maps, but we also consider variants of these requirements. We generalize the definition of complete positivity to linear maps defined on arbitrary subspaces, then formulate this notion as a semidefinite program, and relate it by duality to approximative extensions of this map. This gives a characterization of the maps which can be approximated arbitrarily well as the restriction of a map that is completely positive on the whole algebra, also yielding the familiar extension theorems on operator spaces. For quantum channel extensions and extensions by probabilistic operations we obtain semidefinite characterizations, and we also elucidate the special case of Abelian in- or outputs. Finally, revisiting a theorem by Alberti and Uhlmann, we provide simpler and more widely applicable conditions for certain extension problems on qubits, and by using a semidefinite programming formulation we exhibit counterexamples to seemingly reasonable but false generalizations of the Alberti-Uhlmann theorem.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0690  
<blockquote>
<p>
The use of Raman laser generated by modulation for light-pulse atom interferometer allows to have a laser system more compact and robust. However, the additional laser frequencies generated can perturb the atom interferometer. In this article, we present a precise calculation of the phase shift induced by the additional laser frequencies. The model is validated by comparison with experimental measurements on an atom gravimeter. The uncertainty of the phase shift determination limits the accuracy of our compact gravimeter at 8.10^-8 m/s^2. We show that it is possible to reduce considerably this inaccuracy with a better control of experimental parameters or with particular interferometer configurations.

**44.    Specific heats of quantum double-well systems**

Phys. Rev. E 86 (2012) 061104  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2058  
<blockquote>
<p>
Specific heats of quantum systems with symmetric and asymmetric double-well potentials have been calculated. In numerical calculations of their specific heats, we have adopted the combined method which takes into account not only eigenvalues of $\epsilon_n$ for $0 \leq n \leq N_m$ obtained by the energy-matrix diagonalization but also their extrapolated ones for $N_m+1 \leq n < \infty$ ($N_m=20$ or 30). Calculated specific heats are shown to be rather different from counterparts of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, specific heats of symmetric double-well systems at very low temperatures have the Schottky-type anomaly, which is rooted to a small energy gap in low-lying two-level eigenstates induced by a tunneling through the potential barrier. The Schottky-type anomaly is removed when an asymmetry is introduced into the double-well potential. It has been pointed out that the specific-heat calculation of a double-well system reported by Feranchuk, Ulyanenkov and Kuz'min [Chem. Phys. 157, 61 (1991)] is misleading because the zeroth-order operator method they adopted neglects crucially important off-diagonal contributions.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study qubit decoherence under generalized dispersive readout, i.e., we investigate a qubit coupled to a resonantly driven dissipative harmonic oscillator. We provide a complete picture by allowing for arbitrarily large qubit-oscillator detuning and by considering also a coupling to the square of the oscillator coordinate, which is relevant for flux qubits. Analytical results for the decoherence time are obtained by a transformation of the qubit-oscillator Hamiltonian to the dispersive frame and a subsequent master equation treatment beyond the Markov limit. We predict a crossover from Markovian decay to a decay with Gaussian shape. Our results are corroborated by the numerical solution of the full qubit-oscillator master equation in the original frame.

We demonstrate amplification of a microwave signal by a strongly driven two-level system in a coplanar waveguide resonator. The effect known from optics as dressed-state lasing is observed with a single quantum system formed by a persistent current (flux) qubit. The transmission through the resonator is enhanced when the Rabi frequency of the driven qubit is tuned into resonance with one of the resonator modes. Amplification as well as linewidth narrowing of a weak probe signal has been observed. The laser emission at the resonator's fundamental mode has been studied by measuring the emission spectrum. We analyzed our system and found an excellent agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions obtained in the dressed-state model.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate guiding of cold 85Rb atoms through a 100-micron-diameter hollow core dielectric waveguide using cylindrical hollow modes. We have transported atoms using blue-detuned light in the 1st order, azimuthally-polarized TE01 hollow mode, and the 2nd order hollow modes (HE31, EH11, and HE12), and compared these results with guidance in the red-detuned, fundamental HE11 mode. The blue-detuned hollow modes confine atoms to low intensity along the capillary axis, far from the walls. We determine scattering rates in the guides by directly measuring the effect of recoil on the atoms. We observe higher atom numbers guided using red-detuned light in the HE11 mode, but a 10-fold reduction in scattering rate using the 2nd order modes, which have an r^4 radial intensity profile to lowest order. We show that the red-detuned guides can be used to load atoms into the blue-detuned modes when both high atom number and low perturbation are desired.

Consider a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space $\cH$, with $dim(\cH) \geq 3$, define $\bS(\cH):= \{x\in \cH \:|\: ||x||=1\}$, and let $\nu_\cH$ be the unique regular Borel positive measure invariant under the action of the unitary operators in $\cH$, with $\nu_\cH(\bS(\cH))=1$. We prove that if a complex frame function $f : \bS(\cH)\to \bC$ satisfies $f \in \cL^2(\bS(\cH), \nu_\cH)$, then it verifies Gleason's statement: There is a unique linear operator $A: \cH \to \cH$ such that $f(u) = < u| A u>$ for every $u \in \bS(\cH)$. $A$ is Hermitean when $f$ is real. No boundedness requirement is thus assumed on $f$ {\em a priori}.

We evaluate the QKD performance of these various parity check matrices as a function of the quantum bit error rate. We also discuss the computational precision required for this LPDC algorithm. As QKD evolves towards deployment, complete algorithm descriptions and performance analysis, as we present, will be required.

The modeling of physical processes is an integral part of scientific and technical research. In this area, the Extendible C++ Application in Quantum Technologies (ECAQT) package provides the numerical simulations and modeling of complex quantum systems in the presence of decoherence with wide applications in photonics. It allows creating models of interacting complex systems and simulates their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers. Physical simulations involving massive amounts of calculations are often executed on distributed computing infrastructures. It is often difficult for non expert users to use such computational infrastructures or even to use advanced libraries over the infrastructures, because they often require being familiar with middleware and tools, parallel programming techniques and packages. The P-RADE Grid Portal is a Grid portal solution that allows users to manage the whole life-cycle for executing a parallel application on the computing Grid infrastructures. The article describes the functionality and the structure of the web portal based on ECAQT package.

<p>
The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single, albeit probabilistic, outcome. The time-scale of this "instantaneous" process can be stretched using weak measurements so that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. We monitor the dynamics of a resonantly driven quantum two-level system -- a superconducting quantum bit --using a near-noiseless parametric amplifier. The high-fidelity measurement output is used to actively stabilize the phase of Rabi oscillations, enabling them to persist indefinitely. This new functionality shows promise for fighting decoherence and defines a path for continuous quantum error correction.
