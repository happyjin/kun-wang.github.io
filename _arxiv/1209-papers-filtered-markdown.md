**1.    Multiaccess quantum communication and product higher rank numerical range**  
Maciej Demianowicz, Pawe? Horodecki, Karol ?yczkowski  
Quant. Inf. Comp. 13, 0541-0566 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0119  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the present paper we initiate the study of the product higher rank numerical range. The latter, being a variant of the higher rank numerical range [M.--D. Choi {\it et al.}, Rep. Math. Phys. {\bf 58}, 77 (2006); Lin. Alg. Appl. {\bf 418}, 828 (2006)], is a natural tool for studying construction of quantum error correction codes for multiple access channels. We review properties of this set and relate it to other numerical ranges, which were recently introduced in the literature. Further, the concept is applied to the construction of codes for bi--unitary two--access channels with a hermitian noise model. Analytical techniques for both outerbounding the product higher rank numerical range and determining its exact shape are developed for this case. Finally, the reverse problem of constructing a noise model for a given product range is considered.

**2.    Quantum Error Correction with Uniformly Mixed State Ancillae**  
Yasushi Kondo, Chiara Bagnasco, Mikio Nakahara  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0557  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is often assumed that the ancilla qubits required for encoding a qubit in quantum error correction (QEC) have to be in pure states, $|00...0>$ for example. In this letter, we seek an encoding scheme, in which the ancillae may be in a uniformly mixed state. We demonstrate our scheme experimentally by making use of a three-qubit NMR quantum computer. Moreover, the encoded state has an interesting nature in terms of Quantum Discord, or purely quantum correlations between the data-qubit and ancillae.

**3.    Effect of qubit losses on Grover's quantum search algorithm**  
D. D. Bhaktavatsala Rao, Klaus M?lmer  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 042321 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0637  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the performance of Grover's quantum search algorithm on a register which is subject to loss of the particles that carry the qubit information. Under the assumption that the basic steps of the algorithm are applied correctly on the correspondingly shrinking register, we show that the algorithm converges to mixed states with 50% overlap with the target state in the bit positions still present. As an alternative to error correction, we present a procedure that combines the outcome of different trials of the algorithm to determine the solution to the full search problem. The procedure may be relevant for experiments where the algorithm is adapted as the loss of particles is registered, and for experiments with Rydberg blockade interactions among neutral atoms, where monitoring of the atom losses is not even necessary.

**4.    Deterministic generation of an on-demand Fock state**  
Keyu Xia, Gavin K. Brennen, Demosthenes Ellinas, Jason Twamley  
Optics Express, Vol. 20, Issue 24, pp. 27198-27211 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0858  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically study the deterministic generation of photon Fock states on-demand using a protocol based on a Jaynes Cummings quantum random walk which includes damping. We then show how each of the steps of this protocol can be implemented in a low temperature solid-state quantum system with a Nitrogen-Vacancy centre in a nano-diamond coupled to a nearby high-Q optical cavity. By controlling the coupling duration between the NV and the cavity via the application of a time dependent Stark shift, and by increasing the decay rate of the NV via stimulated emission depletion (STED) a Fock state with high photon number can be generated on-demand. Our setup can be integrated on a chip and can be accurately controlled.

**5.    Programming a Topological Quantum Computer**  
Simon J. Devitt, Kae Nemoto  
Test Symposium (ATS), 2012 IEEE 21st Asian, pp 55-60  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1441  
<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum computing has recently proven itself to be a powerful computational model when constructing viable architectures for large scale computation. The topological model is constructed from the foundation of a error correction code, required to correct for inevitable hardware faults that will exist for a large scale quantum device. It is also a measurement based model of quantum computation, meaning that the quantum hardware is responsible only for the construction of a large, computationally universal quantum state. This quantum state is then strategically consumed, allowing for the realisation of a fully error corrected quantum algorithm. The number of physical qubits needed by the quantum hardware and the amount of time required to implement an algorithm is dictated by the manner in which this universal quantum state is consumed. In this paper we examine the problem of algorithmic optimisation in the topological lattice and introduce the required elements that will be needed when designing a classical software package to compile and implement a large scale algorithm on a topological quantum computer.

**6.    Multimode entanglement in coupled cavity arrays**  
Timothy C. H. Liew, Vincenzo Savona  
New Journal of Physics 15, 025015 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1543  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a driven-dissipative array of coupled nonlinear optical resonators by numerically solving the Von Neumann equation for the density matrix. We demonstrate that quantum correlated states of many photons can be generated also in the limit where the nonlinearity is much smaller than the losses, contrarily to common expectations. Quantum correlations in this case arise from interference between different pathways that the system can follow in the Hilbert space to reach its steady state under the effect of coherent driving fields. We characterize in particular two systems: a linear chain of three coupled cavities and an array of eight coupled cavities. We demonstrate the existence of a parameter range where the system emits photons with continuous-variable bipartite and quadripartite entanglement, in the case of the first and the second system respectively. This entanglement is shown to survive realistic rates of pure dephasing and opens a new perspective for the realization of quantum simulators or entangled photon sources without the challenging requirement of strong optical nonlinearities.

**7.    Coherent Time Evolution and Boundary Conditions of Two-Photon Quantum Walks**  
Jasmin D. A. Meinecke, Konstantinos Poulios, Alberto Politi, Jonathan C. F. Matthews, Alberto Peruzzo, Nur Ismail, Kerstin W?rhoff, Jeremy L. O'Brien, Mark G. Thompson  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012308 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1599  
<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-photon quantum walks in integrated optics are an attractive controlled quantum system, that can mimic less readily accessible quantum systems and exhibit behavior that cannot in general be accurately replicated by classical light without an exponential overhead in resources. The ability to observe time evolution of such systems is important for characterising multi-particle quantum dynamics---notably this includes the effects of boundary conditions for walks in spaces of finite size. Here we demonstrate the coherent evolution of quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons using planar arrays of 21 evanescently coupled waveguides fabricated in silicon oxynitride technology. We compare three time evolutions, that follow closely a model assuming unitary evolution, corresponding to three different lengths of the array---in each case we observe quantum interference features that violate classical predictions. The longest array includes reflecting boundary conditions.

**8.    Qubit-Controlled Displacements in Markovian Environments**  
Tommaso Tufarelli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1837  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a particular form of interaction Hamiltonian between qubits and quantum harmonic oscillators, whose closed system dynamics results in qubit controlled displacement operations. We show how this interaction is realizable in many setups, including nanomechanical systems, ion traps, cavity QED and circuit QED, and in each context we provide quantitative estimates for the relevant parameters. The dynamics of the system is investigated through a master equation, including typical decoherence mechanisms resulting from the coupling of the qubit and oscillator to a thermal Markovian environment. We show how to solve the master equation by adopting a phase-space representation for the oscillator, and derive analytical and approximate solutions for many special cases of interest. Finally, our techniques are applied to a relevant example by studying the dynamics of qubit-oscillator entanglement and the preparation of oscillator states with negative Wigner function.

**9.    Three-dimensional quantum photonic elements based on single nitrogen vacancy-centres in laser-written microstructures**  
Andreas W. Schell, Johannes Kaschke, Joachim Fischer, Rico Henze, Janik Wolters, Martin Wegener, Oliver Benson  
Scientific Reports 3, 1577 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2036  
<blockquote>
<p>
A fully integrated quantum optical technology requires active quantum systems incorporated into resonant optical microstructures and inter-connected in three dimensions via photonic wires. Nitrogen vacancy-centres (NV-centres) in diamond which are excellent photostable room temperature single-photon emitters are ideal candidates for that purpose. Extensive research efforts to couple NV-centres to photonic structures such as optical microresonators, microcavities, and waveguides have been pursued. Strategies for integration range from top-down fabrication via etching of diamond membranes to sophisticated bottom-up assembly of hybrid structures using diamond nanocrystals where the latter approach allows for deterministic coupling. Recently, another approach based on the incorporation of nanodiamonds in soft glass optical fibres via a melting process has been introduced. Here, we utilize two-photon direct laser writing (DLW) to fabricate fully three-dimensional (3D) structures from a photoresist mixed with a solution of nanodiamonds containing NV-centres. For the first time, this approach facilitates building integrated 3D quantum photonic elements of nearly arbitrary shapes.

**10.    Quantum Walks on Sierpinski Gaskets**  
Pedro Carlos S. Lara, Renato Portugal, Stefan Boettcher  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2095  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze discrete-time quantum walks on Sierpinski gaskets using a flip-flop shift operator with the Grover coin. We obtain the scaling of two important physical quantities: the mean-square displacement and the mixing time as function of the number of points. The Sierpinski gasket is a fractal that lacks translational invariance and the results differ from those described in the literature for ordinary lattices. We find that the displacement varies with the initial location. Averaged over all initial locations, our simulation obtain an exponent very similar to classical diffusion.

**11.    Surface Code Threshold in the Presence of Correlated Errors**  
E. Novais, Eduardo R. Mucciolo  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 10502 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the fidelity of the surface code in the presence of correlated errors induced by the coupling of physical qubits to a bosonic environment. By mapping the time evolution of the system after one quantum error correction cycle onto a statistical spin model, we show that the existence of an error threshold is related to the appearance of an order-disorder phase transition in the statistical model in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to relate the error threshold to bath parameters and to the spatial range of the correlated errors.

**12.    Quantum Parrondo's games using quantum walks**  
Adrian P. Flitney  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2252  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a quantum walk in one-dimension using two different "coin" operators. By mixing two operators, both of which give a biased walk with negative expectation value for the walker position, it is possible to reverse the bias through interference effects. This effect is analogous to that in Parrondo's games, where alternating two losing (gambling) games can produce a winning game. The walker bias is produced by introducing a phase factor into the coin operator, with two different phase factors giving games $A$ and $B$. We give the range of phases for which the Parrondo effect can be obtained with $A$ and $B$ played alternately or in other (repeated) deterministic sequences. The effect is transitory. For sufficiently large times the original bias resumes.

**13.    Universal set of scalable dynamically corrected gates for quantum error correction with always-on qubit couplings**  
Amrit De, Leonid P. Pryadko  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2764  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a universal set of high fidelity quantum gates to be used on a sparse bipartite lattice with always-on Ising couplings. The gates are based on dynamical decoupling sequences using shaped pulses, they protect against low-frequency phase noise, and can be run in parallel on non-neighboring qubits. This makes them suitable for implementing quantum error correction with low-density parity check codes like the surface codes and their finite-rate generalizations. We illustrate the construction by simulating quantum Zeno effect with the $[[4,2,2]]$ toric code on a spin chain.

**14.    Typical behaviour of the global entanglement of an open multiqubit system in a non-markovian regimen**  
A.P. Majtey, A.R. Plastino  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2812  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the decay of the global entanglement, due to decoherence, of multiqubit systems interacting with a reservoir in a non Markovian regime. We assume that during the decoherence process each qubit of the system interacts with its own, independent environment. Most previous works on this problem focused on particular initial states or families of initial states amenable of analytical treatment. Here we determine numerically the typical, average behaviour of the system corresponding to random initial pure states uniformly distributed (in the whole Hilbert space of $n$-qubit pure states) according to the Haar measure. We study systems consisting of 3, 4, 5, and 6 qubits. In each case we consider also the entanglement dynamics corresponding to important particular initial states, such as the GHZ states or multiqubit states maximizing the global entanglement, and determine in which cases any of these states is representative of the average behaviour associated with general initial states.

**15.    Teleportation of one ququat encoded in single mode superposition of coherent states**  
Hari Prakash, Manoj K Mishra  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2958  
<blockquote>
<p>
Superposition of optical coherent states (SCS) Ket(plus/minus alpha), possessing opposite phases, plays an important role as qubits in quantum information processing tasks like quantum computation, teleportation, cryptography etc. and are of fundamental importance in testing quantum mechanics. Recently, ququats and qutrits defined in four and three dimensional (D) Hilbert space, respectively, have attracted much more attention as they present advantage in secure quantum communication and also in researches on the foundation of quantum mechanics. Here, we show that superposition of four non-orthogonal coherent states Ket(plus/minus alpha) and Ket(plus/minus i alpha), that are 90 degrees out of phase, can be employed for encoding one ququat defined in a 4D Hilbert space spanned by four newly defined multi-photonic states, Ket(alpha subscript j) with 4n+j numbers of photons, where, j= 0, 1, 2, 3. We propose a scheme which generates states Ket(alpha subscript j). When these states fall on a 50-50 beam splitter, the result is bipartite four-component entangled coherent state which represents equivalently an entangled ququat. Finally, we propose a linear optical scheme that gives almost perfect teleportation (minimum average fidelity greater than or equal to 0.99) of single ququat encoded in SCS using entangled ququat based on coherent states with almost perfect success rate for coherent amplitude mod(alpha) greater than or equal to 3.2. The present theoretical investigation and teleportation protocol is important in the sense that ququat allows the quantum information to be encoded and processed much more compactly and efficiently using fewer coupled quantum system.

**16.    Noise-enhanced quantum transport on a closed loop using quantum walks**  
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch  
Quantum Information Processing, Volume 13, Issue 6, Pages 1313-1329 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3144  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of noise on the transport of a quantum state from a closed loop of $n-$sites with one of the sites as a sink. Using a discrete-time quantum walk dynamics, we demonstrate that the transport efficiency can be enhanced with noise when the number of sites in the loop is small and reduced when the number of sites in the loop grows. By using the concept of measurement induced disturbance we identify the regimes in which genuine quantum effects are responsible for the enhanced transport.

Partha Ghose  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3169  
<blockquote>
<p>
A method is proposed for generating and discriminating Bell states of high fidelity from consecutive single-photons generated in a semiconductor quantum dot. The use of a non-symmetric beam splitter is found to be essential and sufficient, and no nonlinear optical process such as SPDC is required at any stage. This should be of considerable importance for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Peng Xue, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review A 87(2), 022334 (22 Feb 2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3376  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the standard quantum-walk quantum-to-classical transition, characterized by ballistic-to-diffusive spreading of the walker's position, can be controlled by externally modulating the coin state. We illustrate by showing an oscillation between classical diffusive and quantum ballistic spreading using numerical and asymptotically exact closed-form solutions, and we prove that the walker is in a controllable incoherent mixture of classical and quantum walks with a reversible quantum-to-classical transition.

Masahito Hayashi

<blockquote>
<p>
This article proposes a unified method to estimation of group action by using the inverse Fourier transform of the input state. The method provides optimal estimation for commutative and non-commutative group with/without energy constraint. The proposed method can be applied to projective representations of non-compact groups as well as of compact groups. This paper addresses the optimal estimation of R, U(1), SU(2), SO(3), and R^2 with Heisenberg representation under a suitable energy constraint.

**20.    Accurate simulations of planar topological codes cannot use cyclic boundaries**  
Austin G. Fowler  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 062320 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3539  
<blockquote>
<p>
Cyclic boundaries are used in many branches of physics and mathematics, typically to assist the approximation of a large space. We show that when determining the performance of planar, fault-tolerant, topological quantum error correction, using cyclic boundaries leads to a significant underestimate of the logical error rate. We present cyclic and non-cyclic surface code simulations exhibiting this discrepancy, and analytic formulae precisely reproducing the observed behavior in the limit of low physical error. These asymptotic formulae are then used to prove that the underestimate is exponentially large in the code distance d at any fixed physical error rate p below the threshold error rate p_th.

**21.    Photon blockade induced by atoms with Rydberg coupling**  
Jin-Feng Huang, Jie-Qiao Liao, C. P. Sun  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 023822 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3935  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the photon blockade of two-photon scattering in a one-dimensional waveguide, which contains two atoms coupled via the Rydberg interaction. We obtain the analytic scattering solution of photonic wave packets with the Laplace transform method. We examine the photon correlation by addressing the two-photon relative wave function and the second-order correlation function in the single- and two-photon resonance cases. It is found that, under the single-photon resonance condition, photon bunching and antibunching can be observed in the two-photon transmission and reflection, respectively. In particular, the bunching and antibunching effects become stronger with the increasing of the Rydberg coupling strength. In addition, we find a phenomenon of bunching-antibunching transition caused by the two-photon resonance.

**22.    Optimising the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm**  
Pham Tien Trung, Rodney Van Meter, Clare Horsman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4139  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is the standard method used for approximating arbitrary single-qubit gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper we introduce a technique called "search space expansion", which modifies the initial stage of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, increasing the length of the possible approximating sequences but without requiring an exhaustive search over all possible sequences. We show that our technique, combined with a GNAT geometric tree search outputs gate sequences that are almost an order of magnitude smaller for the same level of accuracy. This therefore significantly reduces the error correction requirements for quantum algorithms on encoded fault-tolerant hardware.

**23.    Defining Quantum Control Flow**  
Mingsheng Ying, Nengkun Yu, Yuan Feng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4379  
<blockquote>
<p>
A remarkable difference between quantum and classical programs is that the control flow of the former can be either classical or quantum. One of the key issues in the theory of quantum programming languages is defining and understanding quantum control flow. A functional language with quantum control flow was defined by Altenkirch and Grattage [\textit{Proc. LICS'05}, pp. 249-258]. This paper extends their work, and we introduce a general quantum control structure by defining three new quantum program constructs, namely quantum guarded command, quantum choice and quantum recursion. We clarify the relation between quantum choices and probabilistic choices. An interesting difference between quantum recursions with classical control flows and with quantum control flows is revealed.

<blockquote>
<p>
Tracking a randomly varying optical phase is a key task in metrology, with applications in optical communication. The best precision for optical phase tracking has till now been limited by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of coherent light. Here we surpass this coherent-state limit by using a continuous-wave beam in a phase-squeezed quantum state. Unlike in previous squeezing-enhanced metrology, restricted to phases with very small variation, the best tracking precision (for a fixed light intensity) is achieved for a finite degree of squeezing, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. By optimizing the squeezing we track the phase with a mean square error 15 \pm 4 % below the coherent-state limit.

We present a scheme for the multi-electron Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state analyzer, resorting to an interface between the polarization of a probe photon and the spin of an electron in a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity.

First, it is a complete GHZ-state analyzer for multi-electron spin systems. Second, the initial entangled states remain after being identified and they can be used for a successive task. Third, the electron qubits are static and the photons play a role of a medium for information transfer, which has a good application in quantum repeater in which the electron qubits are used to store the information and the photon qubits are used to transfer the information between others.

Phys. Rev A 86, 042309 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4953  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks constitute important tools in different applications, especially in quantum algorithms. To a great extent their usefulness is due to unusual diffusive features, allowing much faster spreading than their classical counterparts. Such behavior, although frequently credited to intrinsic quantum interference, usually is not completely characterized. Using a recently developed Green's function approach [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 84}, 042343 (2011)], here it is described -- in a rather general way -- the problem dynamics in terms of a true sum over paths history a la Feynman. It allows one to explicit identify interference effects and also to explain the emergence of superdiffusivity. The present analysis has the potential to help in designing quantum walks with distinct transport properties.

Phys. Rev. A 86, 062108 (2012)

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a recently proposed measure for the quantification of quantum non-Markovianity in the dynamics of open systems which is based on the exchange of information between the open system and its environment. This measure relates the degree of memory effects to certain optimal initial state pairs featuring a maximal flow of information from the environment back to the open system. We rigorously prove that the states of these optimal pairs must lie on the boundary of the space of physical states and that they must be orthogonal. This implies that quantum memory effects are maximal for states which are initially distinguishable with certainty, having a maximal information content. Moreover, we construct an explicit example which demonstrates that optimal quantum states need not be pure states.

These walks can take quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is quantum, the walks can be interpreted as performing state discrimination.

Spatial characteristics is verified by measurements of the M2 beam quality factors. We also prepared a postselected polarization-entangled two-photon state shown to violate Bell's inequality. Similar techniques based on intermodal dispersion can be used to generate spatial entanglement and hyperentanglement.

As an application of the exact master equation, we study the active probing of non-Markovianity of the quantum dissipation of a single boson mode of electromagnetic (EM) field in a cavity QED system. The non-Markovianity of the bath of the cavity is explicitly reflected by the atomic decoherence factor.

Cyril Stark  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 052109 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5737

<p>
State and measurement tomography make assumptions about the experimental states or measurements. These assumptions are often not justified because state preparation and measurement errors are unavoidable in practice. Here we describe how the Gram matrix associated with the states and measurement operators can be estimated via semidefinite programming if the states and the measurements are so called globally completable. This is for instance the case if the unknown measurements are known to be projective and non-degenerate. The computed Gram matrix determines the states, and the measurement operators uniquely up to simultaneous rotations in the space of Hermitian matrices. We prove the reliability of the proposed method in the limit of a large number of independent measurement repetitions.

**34.    Comparison of non-Markovianity criteria in a qubit system under random external fields**  
Maria Mannone, Rosario Lo Franco, Giuseppe Compagno  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6331  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give the map representing the evolution of a qubit under the action of non-dissipative random external fields. From this map we construct the corresponding master equation that in turn allows us to phenomenologically introduce population damping of the qubit system. We then compare, in this system, the time-regions when non-Markovianity is present on the basis of different criteria both for the non-dissipative and dissipative case. We show that the adopted criteria agree both in the non-dissipative case and in the presence of population damping.

<blockquote>
<p>
Long-distance quantum communication networks require appropriate interfaces between matter qubit-based nodes and low-loss photonic quantum channels. We implement a downconversion quantum interface, where the single photons emitted from a semiconductor quantum dot at 910 nm are downconverted to 1560 nm using a fiber-coupled periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide and a 2.2-$\mu$m pulsed pump laser. The single-photon character of the quantum dot emission is preserved during the downconversion process: we measure a cross-correlation $g^{(2)}(\tau = 0) = 0.17$ using resonant excitation of the quantum dot. We show that the downconversion interface is fully compatible with coherent optical control of the quantum dot electron spin through the observation of Rabi oscillations in the downconverted photon counts. These results represent a critical step towards a long-distance hybrid quantum network in which subsystems operating at different wavelengths are connected through quantum frequency conversion devices and 1.5-$\mu$m quantum channels.

**36.    Constraints on non-Newtonian gravity and light elementary particles from measurements of the Casimir force by means of dynamic AFM**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0086  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive constraints on corrections to Newtonian gravity of the Yukawa type and light elementary particles from two recently performed measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force. In the first measurement the configuration of two Au surfaces has been used, whereas in the second a nonmagnetic metal Au interacted with a magnetic metal Ni. In these configurations one arrives at different, respectively, similar theoretical predictions for the Casimir force when the competing theoretical approaches are employed. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the constraints following from both experiments are in mutual agreement and in line with constraints obtained from earlier measurements. This confirms the reliability of constraints on non-Newtonian gravity obtained from measurements of the Casimir force.

<blockquote>
<p>
A theoretical approach for a non-perturbative dynamical description of two interacting atoms in an optical lattice potential is introduced. The approach builds upon the stationary eigenstates found by a procedure described in Grishkevich et al. [Phys. Rev. A 84, 062710 (2011)]. It allows presently to treat any time-dependent external perturbation of the lattice potential up to quadratic order. Example calculations of the experimentally relevant cases of an acceleration of the lattice and the turning-on of an additional harmonic confinement are presented.

**38.    Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics, Engineered Hierarchies of Integrable Potentials, and the Generalised Laguerre Polynomials**  
Daddy Balondo Iyela, Jan Govaerts, M. Norbert Hounkonnou  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0182  
<blockquote>
<p>
Within the context of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and its related hierarchies of integrable quantum Hamiltonians and potentials, a general programme is outlined and applied to its first two simplest illustrations. Going beyond the usual restriction of shape invariance for intertwined potentials, it is suggested to require a similar relation for Hamiltonians in the hierarchy separated by an arbitrary number of levels, N. By requiring further that these two Hamiltonians be in fact identical up to an overall shift in energy, a periodic structure is installed in the hierarchy of quantum systems which should allow for its solution. Specific classes of orthogonal polynomials characteristic of such periodic hierarchies are thereby generated, while the methods of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics then lead to generalised Rodrigues formulae and recursion relations for such polynomials. The approach also offers the practical prospect of quantum modelling through the engineering of quantum potentials from experimental energy spectra. In this paper these ideas are presented and solved explicitly for the cases N=1 and N=2. The latter case is related to the generalised Laguerre polynomials, for which indeed new results are thereby obtained. At the same time new classes of integrable quantum potentials which generalise that of the harmonic oscillator and which are characterised by two arbitrary energy gaps are identified, for which a complete solution is achieved algebraically.

<p>
We study theoretically the cascaded four-wave mixing (FWM) in broadband tapered plasmonic nanoantennas and demonstrate a 300-fold increase in nonlinear frequency conversion detected in the main lobe of the nanoantenna far-field pattern. This is achieved by tuning the elements of the nanoantenna to resonate frequencies involved into the FWM interaction. Our findings have a potentially broad application in ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy, sensing, on-chip optical frequency conversion, nonlinear optical metamaterials and photon sources.

<p>
It is shown that slow Bragg soliton solutions are possible in nonlinear complex parity-time (PT) symmetric periodic structures. Analysis indicates that the PT-symmetric component of the periodic optical refractive index can modify the grating band structure and hence the effective coupling between the forward and backward waves. Starting from a classical modified massive Thirring model, solitary wave solutions are obtained in closed form. The basic properties of these slow solitary waves and their dependence on their respective PT-symmetric gain/loss profile are then explored via numerical simulations.

Norio Konno, Hyun Jae Yoo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1419  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the limit distributions of open quantum random walks on one-dimensional lattice space. We introduce a dual process to the original quantum walk process, which is quite similar to the relation of Schr\"odinger-Heisenberg representation in quantum mechanics. By this, we can compute the distribution of the open quantum random walks concretely for many examples and thereby we can also obtain the limit distributions of them. In particular, it is possible to get rid of the initial state when we consider the evolution of the walk, it appears only in the last step of the computation.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum behaviour of mechanical resonators is a new and emerging field driven by recent experiments reaching the quantum ground state. The high frequency, small mass, and large quality-factor of carbon nanotube resonators make them attractive for quantum nanomechanical applications. A common element in experiments achieving the resonator ground state is a second quantum system, such as coherent photons or superconducting device, coupled to the resonators motion. For nanotubes, however, this is a challenge due to their small size. Here, we couple a carbon nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) device to a superconducting circuit. Suspended carbon nanotubes act as both superconducting junctions and moving elements in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). We observe a strong modulation of the flux through the SQUID from displacements of the nanotube. Incorporating this SQUID into superconducting resonators and qubits should enable the detection and manipulation of nanotube mechanical quantum states at the single-phonon level.

Phys. Rev. B 87, 115419 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1724  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum theory for the interaction of a two level emitter with surface plasmon polaritons confined in single-mode waveguide resonators. Based on the Green's function approach, we develop the conditions for the weak and strong coupling regimes by taking into account the sources of dissipation and decoherence: radiative and non-radiative decays, internal loss processes in the emitter, as well as propagation and leakage losses of the plasmons in the resonator. The theory is supported by numerical calculations for several quantum emitters, GaAs and CdSe quantum dots and NV centers together with different types of resonators constructed of hybrid, cylindrical or wedge waveguides. We further study the role of temperature and resonator length. Assuming realistic leakage rates, we find the existence of an optimal length at which strong coupling is possible. Our calculations show that the strong coupling regime in plasmonic resonators is accessible within current technology when working at very low temperatures (<4K). In the weak coupling regime our theory accounts for recent experimental results. By further optimization we find highly enhanced spontaneous emission with Purcell factors over 1000 at room temperature for NV-centers. We finally discuss more applications for quantum nonlinear optics and plasmon-plasmon interactions.

The results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and show the potential of silicon micro-ring resonators as room temperature sources for integrated quantum optics applications.

We show that complex PT-symmetric photonic lattices can lead to a new class of self-imaging Talbot effects. For this to occur, we find that the input field pattern, has to respect specific periodicities which are dictated by the symmetries of the system. While at the spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking point, the image revivals occur at Talbot lengths governed by the characteristics of the passive lattice, at the exact phase it depends on the gain and loss parameter thus allowing one to control the imaging process.

We exploit the biased tip of a scanning gate microscope (SGM) to induce a controlled backscattering between counter-propagating edge channels in a wide constriction in the quantum Hall regime. We compare our detailed conductance maps with a numerical percolation model and demonstrate that conductance fluctuations observed in these devices as a function of the gate voltage originate from backscattering events mediated by localized states pinned by potential fluctuations. Our imaging technique allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the activation of these backscattering processes and also to reconstruct the constriction confinement potential profile and the underlying disorder.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3413  
<blockquote>
<p>
Electron vortex beams carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) are produced in electron microscopes where they are controlled and focused using magnetic lenses. We observe various rotational phenomena arising from the interaction between the OAM and magnetic lenses. First, the Zeeman coupling, proportional to the OAM and magnetic field strength, produces an OAM-independent Larmor rotation of a mode superposition inside the lens. Second, hen passing through the focal plane, the electron beam acquires an additional Gouy phase dependent on the absolute value of the OAM. This brings about the Gouy rotation of the superposition image proportional to the sign of the OAM. A combination of the Larmor and Gouy effects can result in the addition (or subtraction) of rotations, depending on the OAM sign. This behaviour is unique to electron vortex beams and has no optical counterpart, as Larmor rotation occurs only for charged particles. Our experimental results are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions.

**48.    Duality analysis on random planar lattice**  
Masayuki Ohzeki, Keisuke Fujii  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3500  
<blockquote>
<p>
The conventional duality analysis is employed to identify a location of a critical point on a uniform lattice without any disorder in its structure. In the present study, we deal with the random planar lattice, which consists of the randomized structure based on the square lattice. We introduce the uniformly random modification by the bond dilution and contraction on a part of the unit square. The random planar lattice includes the triangular and hexagonal lattices in extreme cases of a parameter to control the structure. The duality analysis in a modern fashion with real-space renormalization is found to be available for estimating the location of the critical points with wide range of the randomness parameter. As a simple testbed, we demonstrate that our method indeed gives several critical points for the cases of the Ising and Potts models, and the bond-percolation thresholds on the random planar lattice. Our method leads to not only such an extension of the duality analyses on the classical statistical mechanics but also a fascinating result associated with optimal error thresholds for a class of quantum error correction code, the surface code on the random planar lattice, which known as a skillful technique to protect the quantum state.

Pei Wang  
Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 494 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3881  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a numerical method for studying the real time dynamics of a small interacting quantum system coupled to an infinite fermionic reservoir. By building an orthonormal basis in the operator space, we turn the Heisenberg equation of motion into a system of linear differential equations, which is then solved iteratively by constructing excitation operators. The application of our method depends on a layer structure in the operator space, which help us to turn an infinite linear system into a series of small systems. We apply the method to investigate the decoherence dynamics of quantum impurity models in the Kondo regime with a non-Markovian reservoir. Taking full account of environmental back-actions and electron-electron interactions, we find that the coexistence of the Kondo correlation and a non-Markovian reservoir induces coherence ringings, which will be suppressed by either driving the system away from the particle-hole symmetric point or changing the reservoir into a Markovian one.

Our scheme relies on the realization of pure superradiant Dicke models by a destructive interference that cancels dipole-dipole interactions in one-dimension.

We perform linear and non-linear photon absorption calculations in topological insulator ultra-thin films on a substrate. Due to the unique band structure of the coupled topological surface states, novel features are observed for suitable photon frequencies, including a divergent edge singularity in one-photon absorption process and a significantly enhancement in two-photon absorption process. The resonanct frequencies can be controlled by tuning the energy difference and coupling of the top and bottom surface states. Such unique linear and nonlinear optical properties make ultra-thin films of topological insulators promising material building blocks for tunable high-efficiency nanophotonic devices.
