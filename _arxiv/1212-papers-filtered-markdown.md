**1.    Generalizing and Derandomizing Gurvits's Approximation Algorithm for the Permanent**  
Scott Aaronson, Travis Hance  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0025  
<blockquote>
<p>
Around 2002, Leonid Gurvits gave a striking randomized algorithm to approximate the permanent of an n*n matrix A. The algorithm runs in O(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive error. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary matrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to quantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a central role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their recent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had to talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems. In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an idea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a better approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated columns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate the probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome involving multiple photons "bunched" in the same mode---at least as well as that probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of course, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper bound on the probabilities of "bunched" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture of Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest. Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the special case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we generalize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct "complex eps-biased sets," then use those sets to derandomize even our generalization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again for nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general A remains an outstanding problem.

**2.    Asymptotically optimal approximation of single qubit unitaries by Clifford and T circuits using a constant number of ancillary qubits**  
Vadym Kliuchnikov, Dmitri Maslov, Michele Mosca  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 190502 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0822  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit unitaries with precision {\epsilon} using O(log(1/{\epsilon})) Clifford and T gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits. The algorithm for computing our approximating circuit requires an average of O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon})) operations. We prove that the number of gates in our circuit saturates the lower bound on the number of gates required in the scenario when a constant number of ancillae are supplied, and as such, our circuits are asymptotically optimal. This results in significant improvement over the current state of the art for finding an approximation of a unitary, including the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm that requires O(log^{3+{\delta}}(1/{\epsilon})) gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon})) gates, but uses O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})) ancillae.

**3.    Weak limits for quantum walks on the half-line**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
Int. J. Quant. Inf., Vol. 11, No. 5 (2013) 1350054  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1109  
<blockquote>
<p>
For a discrete two-state quantum walk (QW) on the half-line with a general condition at the boundary, we formulate and prove a weak limit theorem describing the terminal behavior of its transition probabilities. In this context, localization is possible even for a walk predicated on the assumption of homogeneity. For the Hadamard walk on the half-line, the weak limit is shown to be independent of the initial coin state and to exhibit no localization.

**4.    Families of completely positive maps associated with monotone metrics**  
Fumio Hiai, Hideki Kosaki, Denes Petz, Mary Beth Ruskai  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1337  
<blockquote>
<p>
An operator convex function on (0,\infty) which satisfies the symmetry condition k(1/x) = x k(x) can be used to define a type of non-commutative multiplication by a positive definite matrix (or its inverse) using the primitive concepts of left and right multiplication and the functional calculus. The operators for the inverse can be used to define quadratic forms associated with Riemannian metrics which contract under the action of completely positive trace-preserving maps. We study the question of when these operators define maps which are also completely positive (CP). Although A --> D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2} is the only case for which both the map and its inverse are CP, there are several well-known one parameter families for which either the map or its inverse is CP. We present a complete analysis of the behavior of these families, as well as the behavior of lines connecting an extreme point with the smallest one and some results for geometric bridges between these points. Our primary tool is an order relation based on the concept of positive definite functions. Although some results can be obtained from known properties, we also prove new results based on the positivity of the Fourier transforms of certain functions. Concrete computations of certain Fourier transforms not only yield new examples of positive definite functions, but also examples in the much stronger class of infinitely divisible functions.

**5.    Absolute magnetometry based on quantum beats in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers**  
Kejie Fang, Victor M. Acosta, Charles Santori, Zhihong Huang, Kohei M. Itoh, Hideyuki Watanabe, Shinichi Shikata, Raymond G. Beausoleil  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1495  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate an absolute magnetometer immune to temperature fluctuation and strain inhomogeneity, based on quantum beats in the ground state of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. We apply this technique to measure low-frequency magnetic field noise using a single nitrogen-vacancy center located within 500 nm of the surface of an isotopically-pure (99.99% C12) diamond. The photon-shot-noise limited sensitivity achieves 38 nT/Hz^1/2 for 4.45 s acquisition time, a factor of 2^1/2 better than the implementation which uses only two spin levels. For long acquisition times (>10 s), we realize up to a factor of 15 improvement in magnetic sensitivity, which demonstrates the robustness of our technique against thermal drifts. Applying our technique to nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles, we eliminate dephasing from longitudinal strain inhomogeneity, resulting in a factor of 2.3 improvement in sensitivity.

**6.    Parity-time symmetric optical coupler with birefringent arms**  
K. Li, D. A. Zezyulin, V. V. Konotop, P. G. Kevrekidis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1676  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work, we propose a PT-symmetric coupler whose arms are birefringent waveguides as a realistic physical model which leads to a so-called quadrimer i.e., a four complex field setting. We seek stationary solutions of the resulting linear and nonlinear model, identifying its linear point of PT symmetry breaking and examining the corresponding nonlinear solutions that persist up to this point, as well as, so-called, ghost states that bifurcate from them. We obtain the relevant symmetry breaking bifurcations and numerically follow the associated dynamics which give rise to growth/decay even within the PT-symmetric phase. Our obtained stationary nonlinear solutions are found to terminate in saddle-center bifurcations which are analogous to the linear PT-phase transition.

**7.    Non-Markovian random unitary qubit dynamics**  
Dariusz Chru?ci≈Ñski, Filip A. Wudarski  
Phys. Lett. A 377, 1425 (2013),  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2029  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare two approaches to non-Markovian quantum evolution: one based on the concept of divisible maps and the other one based on distinguishability of quantum states. The former concept is fully characterized in terms of local generator whereas it is in general not true for the latter one. A simple example of random unitary dynamics of a qubit shows the intricate difference between those approaches. Moreover, in this case both approaches are fully characterized in terms of local decoherence rates. As a byproduct it is shown that entropy might monotonically increase even for non-Markovian qubit dynamics.

**8.    Characterizing Nonclassical Correlations via Local Quantum Uncertainty**  
Davide Girolami, Tommaso Tufarelli, Gerardo Adesso  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 240402 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2214  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum mechanics predicts that measurements of incompatible observables carry a minimum uncertainty which is independent of technical deficiencies of the measurement apparatus or incomplete knowledge of the state of the system. Nothing yet seems to prevent a single physical quantity, such as one spin component, from being measured with arbitrary precision. Here we show that an intrinsic quantum uncertainty on a single observable is ineludible in a number of physical situations. When revealed on local observables of a bipartite system, such uncertainty defines an entire class of bona fide measures of nonclassical correlations. For the case of 2 x d systems, we find that a unique measure is defined, which we evaluate in closed form. We then discuss the role that these correlations, which are of the 'discord' type, can play in the context of quantum metrology. We show in particular that the amount of discord present in a bipartite mixed probe state guarantees a minimum precision, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, in the optimal phase estimation protocol.

**9.    Photonic Boson Sampling in a Tunable Circuit**  
Matthew A. Broome, Alessandro Fedrizzi, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari, Justin Dove, Scott Aaronson, Timothy Ralph, Andrew G. White  
Science 339, 6121 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2234  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers are unnecessary for exponentially-efficient computation or simulation if the Extended Church-Turing thesis---a foundational tenet of computer science---is correct. The thesis would be directly contradicted by a physical device that efficiently performs a task believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is BosonSampling: obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by some linear-optical unitary process. Here we test the central premise of BosonSampling, experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of 3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Strong evidence against the Extended Church-Turing thesis will come from scaling to large numbers of photons, which is a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer.

**10.    Three qubit Grover's algorithm using superconducting quantum interference devices in cavity QED**  
Muhammad Waseem, Rizwan Ahmed, Muhammad Irfan, Shahid Qamar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2558  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme for the implementation of three qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) coupled to a superconducting resonator. The scheme is based on resonant, off-resonant interaction of the cavity field with SQUIDs and the application of classical microwave pulses. We show that adjustment of SQUID level spacing during the gate operations, adiabatic passage, and second-order detuning are not required that leads to faster implementation. We also show that the marked state can be searched with high fidelity even in the presence of level decay and cavity dissipation.

**11.    Numerical analysis of second law of thermodynamics and irreversibility in exemplary quantum systems**  
G.B. Lesovik, I.A. Sadovskyy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2576  
<blockquote>
<p>
We test Boltzmann's H-theorem for several models of particle random walk. We study the influence of interaction between the particle and reservoir/detectors on entropy and find entropy increasing in time for some models and behaving non-monotonically for others. The key mechanism affecting the entropy growth is the quantum entanglement between the system and the reservoir. We discuss the details of the system-reservoir interaction, such as presence of the interference in the system and number of interactions with detector parts, and their impact on the monotonicity of entropy.

Science 339 798-801 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2622  
<blockquote>
<p>
While universal quantum computers ideally solve problems such as factoring integers exponentially more efficiently than classical machines, the formidable challenges in building such devices motivate the demonstration of simpler, problem-specific algorithms that still promise a quantum speedup. We construct a quantum boson sampling machine (QBSM) to sample the output distribution resulting from the nonclassical interference of photons in an integrated photonic circuit, a problem thought to be exponentially hard to solve classically. Unlike universal quantum computation, boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons, linear state evolution, and detectors. We benchmark our QBSM with three and four photons and analyze sources of sampling inaccuracy. Our studies pave the way to larger devices that could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation.

**13.    An information-theoretic account of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem**  
Iman Marvian, Robert W. Spekkens  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3378  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem can be understood as a result in the resource theory of asymmetry asserting the impossibility of perfectly simulating, via symmetric processing, the measurement of an asymmetric observable unless one has access to a state that is perfectly asymmetric, that is, one whose orbit under the group action is a set of orthogonal states. The simulation problem can be characterized information-theoretically by considering how well both the target observable and the resource state can provide an encoding of an element of the symmetry group. Leveraging this information-theoretic perspective, we show that the WAY theorem is a consequence of the no-programming theorem for projective measurements. The connection allows us to clarify the conceptual content of the theorem and to deduce some interesting generalizations.

**14.    Generating superposition of up-to three photons for continuous variable quantum information processing**  
Mitsuyoshi Yukawa, Kazunori Miyata, Takahiro Mizuta, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Petr Marek, Radim Filip, Akira Furusawa  
Optics Express, Vol. 21, Issue 5, pp. 5529-5535 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3396  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop an experimental scheme based on a continuous-wave (cw) laser for generating arbitrary superpositions of photon number states. In this experiment, we successfully generate superposition states of zero to three photons, namely advanced versions of superpositions of two and three coherent states. They are fully compatible with developed quantum teleportation and measurement-based quantum operations with cw lasers. Due to achieved high detection efficiency, we observe, without any loss correction, multiple areas of negativity of Wigner function, which confirm strongly nonclassical nature of the generated states.

**15.    Loss of Memory and Convergence of Quantum Markov Processes**  
Keiji Matsumoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3481  
<blockquote>
<p>
In a quantum (inhomogeneous) Markov process $\rho_1:=\Gamma_1(\rho)$, $\rho_2:=\Gamma_1(\rho_1)$, ..., where $\Gamma_i$ are CPTP maps and $\rho$ is the initial state, the the state of the system is either oscillatory or convergent to a point or convergent to an oscillatory orbit. Whichever the case it is, "information" about the initial state is always monotone non-increasing and convergent. This fact motivate us to define an equivalence class of families of quantum states, which embodies the bundle of all "information quantities" about the initial state. We show, for any quantum inhomogeneous Markov process over a finite dimensional Hilbert space, the trajectory in the space of the all equivalence classes is "monotone decreasing" and convergent to a point, relative to a reasonablly defined topology. Also, a characterization of weak ergodicity in this picture is given.

**16.    Gauge subsystems, separability, and robustness in autonomous quantum memories**  
Gopal Sarma, Hideo Mabuchi  
New Journal of Physics 15 (2013) 035014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3564  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction provides a fertile context for exploring the interplay of feedback control, microscopic physics and noncommutative probability. In this paper we deepen our understanding of this nexus through high-level analysis of a class of quantum memory models that we have previously proposed, which implement continuous-time versions of well-known stabilizer codes in autonomous nanophotonic circuits that require no external clocking or control. We show that the presence of the gauge subsystem in the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code allows for an optimized layout of the corresponding nanophotonic circuit that substantially ameliorates the effects of optical propagation losses, argue that code separability allows for simplified restoration feedback protocols, and propose a modified fidelity metric for quantifying the performance of realistic quantum memories. Our treatment of these topics exploits the homogeneous modeling framework of autonomous nanophotonic circuits, but the key ideas translate to the traditional setting of discrete time, measurement-based quantum error correction.

**17.    Understanding and controlling N-dimensional quantum walks via dispersion relations. Application to the 2D and 3D Grover walks: Diabolical points and more**

New J. Phys. 15 (2013) 073041  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3600  
<blockquote>
<p>
The discrete quantum walk in N dimensions is analyzed from the perspective of its dispersion relations. This allows understanding known properties, as well as designing new ones when spatially extended initial conditions are considered. This is done by deriving wave equations in the continuum, which are generically of the Schr\"odinger type, and allow devising interesting behaviors, such as ballistic propagation without deformation, or the generation of almost flat probability distributions, what is corroborated numerically. There are however special points where the energy surfaces display intersections and, near them, the dynamics is entirely different. Applications to the two- and three-dimensional Grover walks are presented.

**18.    Minimum Energy-Surface Required by Quantum Memory Devices**  
Wim van Dam, Hieu D. Nguyen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3707  
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the question what physical resources are required and sufficient to store classical information. While there is no lower bound on the required energy or space to store information, we find that there is a nonzero lower bound for the product (P = <E> <r^2>) of these two resources. Specifically, we prove that any physical system of mass m and d degrees of freedom that stores S bits of information will have lower bound on the product P that is proportional to d^2/m (exp(S/d)-1)^2. This result is obtained in a non-relativistic, quantum mechanical setting and it is independent from earlier thermodynamical results such as the Bekenstein bound on the entropy of black holes.

Xiaoting Wang, Mark Byrd, Kurt Jacobs  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 012338 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3839  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work, inspired by the study of semidefinite programming for block-diagonalizing matrix *-algebras, we propose an algorithm that can find the algebraic structure of decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's) for a given noisy quantum channel. We prove that this algorithm will work for all cases with probability one, and it is more efficient than the algorithm proposed by Holbrook, Kribs, and Laflamme [Quant. Inf. Proc. 80, 381 (2003)]. In fact, our results reveal that this previous algorithm only works for special cases. As an application, we discuss how this method can be applied to increase the efficiency of an optimization procedure for finding an approximate DFS.

Phys. Rev. A, 87, 052302 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4540  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have emerged as an interesting approach to quantum information processing, exhibiting many unique properties compared to the analogous classical random walk. Here we introduce a model for a discrete-time quantum walk with memory by endowing the walker with multiple recycled coins and using a physical memory function via a history dependent coin flip. By numerical simulation we observe several phenomena. First in one dimension, walkers with memory have persistent quantum ballistic speed up over classical walks just as found in previous studies of multi-coined walks with trivial memory function. However, measurement of the multi-coin state can dramatically shift the mean of the spatial distribution. Second, we consider spatial entanglement in a two-dimensional quantum walk with memory and find that memory destroys entanglement between the spatial dimensions, even when entangling coins are employed. Finally, we explore behaviour in the presence of spatial randomness and find that in contrast to single coined walks, multi-coined walks do not localise and in fact a memory function can speed up the walk relative to a fully decohered multi-coin walker with trivial memory. We explicitly show how to construct linear optics circuits implementing the walks, and discuss prospects for classical simulation.

**21.    Nonlocal Non-Markovian Effects in Dephasing Environments**  
Dong Xie, An Min Wang  
Chin. Phys. B Vol. 23, No. 4 (2014) 040302  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5680  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the nonlocal non-Markovian effects through local interactions between two subsystems and the corresponding two environments. It has been found that the initial correlations between two environments can turn a Markovian to a non-Markovian regime with the extra control on the local interaction time. We further research the nonlocal non-Markovian effects from two situations: without extra control, the nonlocal non-Markovian effects only appear under the condition that two local dynamics are non-Markovian-non-Markovian(both of two local dynamics are non-Markovian), or Markovian-non-Markovian, never appear under the condition of Markovian-Markovian; with extra control, the nonlocal non-Markovian effects can occur under the condition of Markovian-Markovian. It shows that the correlations between two environments has an upper bound: only making a flow of information from the environment back to the global system begin finitely earlier than that back to any one of two local systems, not infinitely. Then, due to observing that the classical correlations between two environments have the same function as the quantum correlations, we advise two special ways to distribute classical correlations between two environments without initial correlations. Finally, from numerical solutions in the spin star configuration we obtain that the self-correlation(internal correlation) of each environment promotes the nonlocal non-Markovian effects.

<p>
A particular family of time- and space-dependent discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) is considered in one dimensional physical space. The continuous limit of these walks is defined through a new procedure and computed in full detail. In this limit, the walks coincide with the propagation of a massless Dirac fermion in an arbitrary gravitational field. A QW mimicking the radial propagation of a fermion outside and inside the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is explicitly constructed and simulated numerically. Finally, the limiting procedure and the main result itself are carefully discussed.

**23.    Disorder induced localization and enhancement of entanglement in one- and two-dimensional quantum walks**  
C. M. Chandrashekar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5984  
<blockquote>
<p>
The time evolution of one- and two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk with increase in disorder is studied. We use spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal broken periodicity of the unitary evolution as disorder to mimic the effect of disordered/random medium in our study. Disorder induces a dramatic change in the interference pattern leading to localization of the quantum walks in one- and two-dimensions. Spatial disorder results in the decreases of the particle and position entanglement in one-dimension and counter intuitively, an enhancement in entanglement with temporal and spatio-temporal disorder is seen. The study signifies that the Anderson localization of quantum state without compromising on the degree of entanglement could be implement in a large variety of physical settings where quantum walks has been realized. The study presented here could make it feasible to explore, theoretically and experimentally the interplay between disorder and entanglement. This also brings up a variety of intriguing questions relating to the negative and positive implications on algorithmic and other applications.

Efficient four-port coupling in the communications C-band and in the high-index-contrast silicon photonics platform is demonstrated, with matching theoretical predictions of the quantum interference visibility. Constituents for the residual quantum visibility imperfection are examined, supported with theoretical analysis of the sequentially-triggered multipair biphoton contribution and techniques for visibility compensation, towards scalable high-bitrate quantum information processing and communications.

<blockquote>
<p>
Geometric phases that characterize the topological properties of Bloch bands play a fundamental role in the modern band theory of solids. Here we report on the direct measurement of the geometric phase acquired by cold atoms moving in one-dimensional optical lattices. Using a combination of Bloch oscillations and Ramsey interferometry, we extract the Zak phase - the Berry phase acquired during an adiabatic motion of a particle across the Brillouin zone - which can be viewed as an invariant characterizing the topological properties of the band. For a dimerized optical lattice, which models polyacetylene, we measure a difference of the Zak phase equal to phi_Zak=0.97(2)pi for the two possible polyacetylene phases with different dimerization. This indicates that the two dimerized phases belong to different topological classes, such that for a filled band, domain walls have fractional quantum numbers. Our work establishes a new general approach for probing the topological structure of Bloch bands in optical lattices.

<p>
The Markov entropy decomposition (MED) is a recently-proposed, cluster-based simulation method for finite temperature quantum systems with arbitrary geometry. In this paper, we detail numerical algorithms for performing the required steps of the MED, principally solving a minimization problem with a preconditioned Newton's algorithm, as well as how to extract global susceptibilities and thermal responses. We demonstrate the power of the method with the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the 2D square lattice, including the extraction of critical points and details of each phase. Although the method shares some qualitative similarities with exact-diagonalization, we show the MED is both more accurate and significantly more flexible.

<p>
We demonstrate a horizontal, linearly guided Mach Zehnder atom interferometer in an optical waveguide. Intended as a proof-of-principle experiment, the interferometer utilises a Bose-Einstein condensate in the magnetically insensitive |F=1,mF=0> state of Rubidium-87 as an acceleration sensitive test mass. We achieve a modest sensitivity to acceleration of da = 7x10^-4 m/s^2. Our fringe visibility is as high as 38% in this optically guided atom interferometer. We observe a time-of-flight in the waveguide of over half a second, demonstrating the utility of our optical guide for future sensors.

<blockquote>
<p>
The use of sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers (TOF's) in warm rubidium vapor has recently been identified as a promising system for realizing ultra-low-power nonlinear optical effects. However, at the relatively high atomic densities needed for many of these experiments, rubidium atoms accumulating on the TOF surface can cause a significant loss of overall transmission through the fiber. Here we report direct measurements of the time-scale associated with this transmission degradation for various rubidium density conditions. Transmission is affected almost immediately after the introduction of rubidium vapor into the system, and declines rapidly as the density is increased. More significantly, we show how a heating element designed to raise the TOF temperature can be used to reduce this transmission loss and dramatically extend the effective TOF transmission lifetime.
