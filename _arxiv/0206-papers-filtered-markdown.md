**2.    The Dirac Equation in Classical Statistical Mechanics**  
G.N. Ord  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206016  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Dirac equation, usually obtained by `quantizing' a classical stochastic model is here obtained directly within classical statistical mechanics. The special underlying space-time geometry of the random walk replaces the missing analytic continuation, making the model `self-quantizing'. This provides a new context for the Dirac equation, distinct from its usual context in relativistic quantum mechanics.

**3.    Quantum random walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno  
Quantum Information Processing, Vol.1, Issue 5, pp.345-354 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206053  
<blockquote>
<p>
This letter treats the quantum random walk on the line determined by a 2 times 2 unitary matrix U. A combinatorial expression for the mth moment of the quantum random walk is presented by using 4 matrices, P, Q, R and S given by U. The dependence of the mth moment on U and initial qubit state phi is clarified. A new type of limit theorems for the quantum walk is given. Furthermore necessary and sufficient conditions for symmetry of distribution for the quantum walk is presented. Our results show that the behavior of quantum random walk is striking different from that of the classical ramdom walk.

**4.    Exact Performance of Concatenated Quantum Codes**  
Benjamin Rahn, Andrew C. Doherty, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206061  
<blockquote>
<p>
When a logical qubit is protected using a quantum error-correcting code, the net effect of coding, decoherence (a physical channel acting on qubits in the codeword) and recovery can be represented exactly by an effective channel acting directly on the logical qubit. In this paper we describe a procedure for deriving the map between physical and effective channels that results from a given coding and recovery procedure. We show that the map for a concatenation of codes is given by the composition of the maps for the constituent codes. This perspective leads to an efficient means for calculating the exact performance of quantum codes with arbitrary levels of concatenation. We present explicit results for single-bit Pauli channels. For certain codes under the symmetric depolarizing channel, we use the coding maps to compute exact threshold error probabilities for achievability of perfect fidelity in the infinite concatenation limit.

**5.    How to correct small quantum errors**  
M. Keyl, R. F. Werner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206086  
<blockquote>
<p>
The theory of quantum error correction is a cornerstone of quantum information processing. It shows that quantum data can be protected against decoherence effects, which otherwise would render many of the new quantum applications practically impossible. In this paper we give a self contained introduction to this theory and to the closely related concept of quantum channel capacities. We show, in particular, that it is possible (using appropriate error correcting schemes) to send a non-vanishing amount of quantum data undisturbed (in a certain asymptotic sense) through a noisy quantum channel T, provided the errors produced by T are small enough.

**6.    Book Review: 'A New Kind of Science'**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206089  
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a critical review of the book 'A New Kind of Science' by Stephen Wolfram. We do not attempt a chapter-by-chapter evaluation, but instead focus on two areas: computational complexity and fundamental physics. In complexity, we address some of the questions Wolfram raises using standard techniques in theoretical computer science. In physics, we examine Wolfram's proposal for a deterministic model underlying quantum mechanics, with 'long-range threads' to connect entangled particles. We show that this proposal cannot be made compatible with both special relativity and Bell inequality violation.

**7.    A Semidefinite Programming Approach to Optimal Unambiguous Discrimination of Quantum States**  
Yonina C. Eldar  
IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 49, pp. 446-456, Feb. 2003.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206093  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a set of linearly independent pure quantum states. We show that the design of the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this formulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is optimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement (EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the states can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal. Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal prior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider geometrically uniform state sets that are defined over a group of unitary matrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider compound geometrically uniform state sets which are generated by a group of unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating vectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.

**8.    An Inverse-Problem Approach to Designing Photonic Crystals for Cavity QED Experiments**  
JM Geremia, Jon Williams, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206094  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic band gap (PBG) materials are attractive for cavity QED experiments because they provide extremely small mode volumes and are monolithic, integratable structures. As such, PBG cavities are a promising alternative to Fabry-Perot resonators. However, the cavity requirements imposed by QED experiments, such as the need for high Q (low cavity damping) and small mode volumes, present significant design challenges for photonic band gap materials. Here, we pose the PBG design problem as a mathematical inversion and provide an analytical solution for a two-dimensional crystal. We then address a planar (2D crystal with finite thickness) structure using numerical techniques.

**9.    A pseudo-simulation of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm**  
J.F.Schneiderman, M.E.Stanley, P.K.Aravind  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206101  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper presents a computer program, written in Maple, that allows a user to simulate certain aspects of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm on a desktop or laptop computer. The program does not simulate the unitary operations carried out by a quantum computer but does faithfully mimic its output at the crucial "readout" step of the order-finding process. The program reqires only two inputs from the user - the number to be factored (which can be up to 10 digits long) and the number of qubits to be used in the factoring (for which a helpful hint is given). The program then returns a detailed history of all its attempts at factoring the number, beginning with its various unsuccessful attempts and ending with the final successful attempt that leads to the correct factors. The structure of the simulation is described, a typical output produced by it is shown, and the factors limiting its performance are discussed. The purpose of this simulation is to provide the user with some "hands-on" experience of how quantum factoring works on integers somewhat larger than can be handled by today's quantum computers.

**10.    A New Type of Limit Theorems for the One-Dimensional Quantum Random Walk**  
Norio Konno  
Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan, Vol.57, No.4, pp.1179-1195 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206103  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we consider the one-dimensional quantum random walk X^{varphi} _n at time n starting from initial qubit state varphi determined by 2 times 2 unitary matrix U. We give a combinatorial expression for the characteristic function of X^{varphi}_n. The expression clarifies the dependence of it on components of unitary matrix U and initial qubit state varphi. As a consequence of the above results, we present a new type of limit theorems for the quantum random walk. In contrast with the de Moivre-Laplace limit theorem, our symmetric case implies that X^{varphi}_n /n converges in distribution to a limit Z^{varphi} as n to infty where Z^{varphi} has a density 1 / pi (1-x^2) sqrt{1-2x^2} for x in (- 1/sqrt{2}, 1/sqrt{2}). Moreover we discuss some known simulation results based on our limit theorems.

**11.    Natural majorization of the Quantum Fourier Transformation in phase-estimation algorithms**  
Roman Orus, Jose I. Latorre, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado  
Quantum Information Processing 1 (4): 283-302 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206134  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that majorization relations hold step by step in the Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) for phase-estimation algorithms considered in the canonical decomposition. Our result relies on the fact that states which are mixed by Hadamard operators at any stage of the computation only differ by a phase. This property is a consequence of the structure of the initial state and of the QFT, based on controlled-phase operators and a single action of a Hadamard gate per qubit. As a consequence, Hadamard gates order the probability distribution associated to the quantum state, whereas controlled-phase operators carry all the entanglement but are immaterial to majorization. We also prove that majorization in phase-estimation algorithms follows in a most natural way from unitary evolution, unlike its counterpart in Grover's algorithm.

**12.    General Qubit Errors Cannot Be Corrected**  
Subhash Kak  
Information Sciences, vol. 152, pp. 195-202, 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206144  
<blockquote>
<p>
Error correction, in the standard meaning of the term, implies the ability to correct all small analog errors and some large errors. Examining assumptions at the basis of the recently proposed quantum error-correcting codes, it is pointed out that these codes can correct only a subset of errors, and are unable to correct small phase errors which can have disastrous consequences for a quantum computation. This shortcoming will restrict their usefulness in real applications.

**13.    Relating the Lorentzian and exponential: Fermi's approximation,the Fourier transform and causality**  
A. Bohm, N. L. Harshman, H. Walther  
Phys. Rev. A 66 (2002), 012107 1-11  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206145  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Fourier transform is often used to connect the Lorentzian energy distribution for resonance scattering to the exponential time dependence for decaying states. However, to apply the Fourier transform, one has to bend the rules of standard quantum mechanics; the Lorentzian energy distribution must be extended to the full real axis $-\infty<E<\infty$ instead of being bounded from below $0\leq E <\infty$ (``Fermi's approximation''). Then the Fourier transform of the extended Lorentzian becomes the exponential, but only for times $t\geq 0$, a time asymmetry which is in conflict with the unitary group time evolution of standard quantum mechanics. Extending the Fourier transform from distributions to generalized vectors, we are led to Gamow kets, which possess a Lorentzian energy distribution with $-\infty<E<\infty$ and have exponential time evolution for $t\geq t_0 =0$ only. This leads to probability predictions that do not violate causality.

**14.    Anomalous power law of quantum reversibility for classically regular dynamics**  
Ph. Jacquod, I. Adagideli, C.W.J. Beenakker  
Europhys. Lett. 61, 729-735 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206160  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Loschmidt Echo M(t) (defined as the squared overlap of wave packets evolving with two slightly different Hamiltonians) is a measure of quantum reversibility. We investigate its behavior for classically quasi-integrable systems. A dominant regime emerges where M(t) ~ t^{-alpha} with alpha=3d/2 depending solely on the dimension d of the system. This power law decay is faster than the result ~ t^{-d} for the decay of classical phase space densities.

**15.    Suitability versus fidelity for rating single-photon guns**  
George M. Hockney, Pieter Kok, Jonathan P. Dowling  
Phys. Rev. A, 67 (2003) 032306  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206198  
<blockquote>
<p>
The creation of specified quantum states is important for most, if not all, applications in quantum computation and communication. The quality of the state preparation is therefore an essential ingredient in any assessment of a quantum-state gun. We show that the fidelity, under the standard definitions is not sufficient to assess quantum sources, and we propose a new measure of suitability that necessarily depends on the application for the source. We consider the performance of single-photon guns in the context of quantum key distribution (QKD) and linear optical quantum computation. Single-photon sources for QKD need radically different properties than sources for quantum computing. Furthermore, the suitability for single-photon guns is discussed explicitly in terms of experimentally accessible criteria.

**16.    Photon statistics and dynamics of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer**  
Andrew J. Berglund, Andrew C. Doherty, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0206301  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report high time-resolution measurements of photon statistics from pairs of dye molecules coupled by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In addition to quantum-optical photon antibunching, we observe photon bunching on a timescale of several nanoseconds. We show by numerical simulation that configuration fluctuations in the coupled fluorophore system could account for minor deviations of our data from predictions of basic Forster theory. With further characterization we believe that FRET photon statistics could provide a unique tool for studying DNA mechanics on timescales from 10^-9 to 10^-3 s.
