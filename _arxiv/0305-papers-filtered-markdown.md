**1.    Diagnosis, prescription and prognosis of a Bell-state filter by quantum process tomography**  
M. W. Mitchell, C. W. Ellenor, S. Schneider, A. M. Steinberg  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305001  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, we apply the techniques of quantum process tomography to characterize errors and decoherence in a prototypical two-photon operation, a singlet-state filter. The quantum process tomography results indicate a large asymmetry in the process and also the required operation to correct for this asymmetry. Finally, we quantify errors and decoherence of the filtering operation after this modification.

**2.    Eliminating ground-state dipole moments in quantum optics via canonical transformation**  
Gediminas Juzeliunas, Luciana Davila Romero, David L. Andrews  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 043811 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305006  
<blockquote>
<p>
By means of a canonical transformation it is shown how it is possible to recast the equations for molecular nonlinear optics to completely eliminate ground-state static dipole coupling terms. Such dipoles can certainly play a highly important role in nonlinear optical response - but equations derived by standard methods, in which these dipoles emerge only as special cases of transition moments, prove unnecessarily complex. It has been shown that the elimination of ground-state static dipoles in favor of dipole shifts results in a considerable simplification in form of the nonlinear optical susceptibilities. In a fully quantum theoretical treatment the validity of such a procedure has previously been verified using an expedient algorithm, whose defense was afforded only by a highly intricate proof. In this paper it is shown how a canonical transformation method entirely circumvents such an approach; it also affords new insights into the formulation of quantum field interactions.

**3.    Quantum Physics of Simple Optical Instruments**  
Ulf Leonhardt  
Rept.Prog.Phys. 66 (2003) 1207-1250  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305007  
<blockquote>
<p>
Simple optical instruments are linear optical networks where the incident light modes are turned into equal numbers of outgoing modes by linear transformations. For example, such instruments are beam splitters, multiports, interferometers, fibre couplers, polarizers, gravitational lenses, parametric amplifiers, phase-conjugating mirrors and also black holes. The article develops the quantum theory of simple optical instruments and applies the theory to a few characteristic situations, to the splitting and interference of photons and to the manifestation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations in parametric downconversion. How to model irreversible devices such as absorbers and amplifiers is also shown. Finally, the article develops the theory of Hawking radiation for a simple optical black hole. The paper is intended as a primer, as a nearly self-consistent tutorial. The reader should be familiar with basic quantum mechanics and statistics, and perhaps with optics and some elementary field theory. The quantum theory of light in dielectrics serves as the starting point and, in the concluding section, as a guide to understand quantum black holes.

**4.    Simulation of quantum random walks using interference of classical field**  
H. Jeong, M. Paternostro, M. S. Kim  
Phys. Rev. A 69, 012310 (2004).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305008  
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest a theoretical scheme for the simulation of quantum random walks on a line using beam splitters, phase shifters and photodetectors. Our model enables us to simulate a quantum random walk with use of the wave nature of classical light fields. Furthermore, the proposed set-up allows the analysis of the effects of decoherence. The transition from a pure mean photon-number distribution to a classical one is studied varying the decoherence parameters.

**5.    Distributed construction of quantum fingerprints**  
Andris Ambainis, Yaoyun Shi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305022  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum fingerprints are useful quantum encodings introduced by Buhrman, Cleve, Watrous, and de Wolf (Physical Review Letters, Volume 87, Number 16, Article 167902, 2001; quant-ph/0102001) in obtaining an efficient quantum communication protocol. We design a protocol for constructing the fingerprint in a distributed scenario. As an application, this protocol gives rise to a communication protocol more efficient than the best known classical protocol for a communication problem.

**6.    What is random about a quantum random walk?**  
Arul Lakshminarayan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305026  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use simple deterministic dynamical systems as coins in studying quantum walks. These dynamical systems can be chosen to display, in the classical limit, a range of behaviors from the integrable to chaotic, or deterministically random. As an example of an integrable coin we study the Fourier walk that generalizes the Hadamard walk and show that the walker slows down with coin dimensionality, which controls the effective Planck constant. Introducing multi-Harper maps as deterministic models of random walks we study the effect of coin chaos on the quantum walk. We also demonstrate that breaking time-reversal symmetry in the coin dynamics effectively slows down the walk.

**7.    Polynomial degree vs. quantum query complexity**  
Andris Ambainis  
Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 72(2): 220-238, 2006  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305028  
<blockquote>
<p>
The degree of a polynomial representing (or approximating) a function f is a lower bound for the number of quantum queries needed to compute f. This observation has been a source of many lower bounds on quantum algorithms. It has been an open problem whether this lower bound is tight. We exhibit a function with polynomial degree M and quantum query complexity \Omega(M^{1.321...}). This is the first superlinear separation between polynomial degree and quantum query complexity. The lower bound is shown by a new, more general version of quantum adversary method.

**8.    The non-Markovian stochastic Schr?dinger equation for the position unraveling**  
Jay Gambetta, H. M. Wiseman  
Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics 6, S821 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305047  
<blockquote>
<p>
An important and well established area of quantum optics is the theory of Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (or by another name quantum trajectory theory). Recently stochastic Schr\"odinger equations have been developed for non-Markovian systems. In this paper we extend the current known stochastic Schr\"odinger equations for non-Markovian systems to include the position unraveling. We also discuss and illustrate that this stochastic Schr\"odinger equation can have an interpretation under both the orthodox and the de Broglie-Bohm hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics. We conclude that only the de Broglie-Bohm hidden variable theory provides a continuous-in-time interpretation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equation.

**9.    Autler-Townes spectroscopy of the $5S_{1/2}-5P_{3/2}-44D$ cascade of cold $^{85}$Rb atoms**  
B. K. Teo, D. Feldbaum, T. Cubel, J. R. Guest, P. R. Berman, G. Raithel  
Physical Review A 68, 053407 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305055  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study nonlinear optical effects in the laser excitation of Rydberg states. $5S_{1/2}$ and $5P_{3/2}$ levels of $^{85}$Rb are strongly coupled by a strong laser field and probed by a weak laser tuned to the $5P_{3/2} - 44D$ Rydberg resonance. We observe high contrast Autler-Townes spectra which are dependent on the pump polarization, intensity and detuning. The observed behavior agrees with calculations, which include the effect of optical pumping.

**10.    Measurement-induced Nonlinearity in Linear Optics**  
Stefan Scheel, Kae Nemoto, William J. Munro, Peter L. Knight  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 032310 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305082  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the generation of nonlinear operators with single photon sources, linear optical elements and appropriate measurements of auxiliary modes. We provide a framework for the construction of useful single-mode and two-mode quantum gates necessary for all-optical quantum information processing. We focus our attention generally on using minimal physical resources while providing a transparent and algorithmic way of constructing these operators.

**11.    Entanglement and correlation in anisotropic quantum spin systems**  
Ulrich Glaser, Helmut BÃ¼ttner, Holger Fehske  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 032318 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305108  
<blockquote>
<p>
Analytical expressions for the entanglement measures concurrence, i-concurrence and 3-tangle in terms of spin correlation functions are derived using general symmetries of the quantum spin system. These relations are exploited for the one-dimensional XXZ-model, in particular the concurrence and the critical temperature for disentanglement are calculated for finite systems with up to six qubits. A recent NMR quantum error correction experiment is analyzed within the framework of the proposed theoretical approach.

**12.    Illustrating the concept of quantum information**  
Richard Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305114  
<blockquote>
<p>
Over the past decade quantum information theory has developed into a vigorous field of research despite the fact that quantum information, as a precise concept, is undefined. Indeed the very idea of viewing quantum states as carriers of some kind of information (albeit unknowable in classical terms), leads naturally to interesting questions that might otherwise never have been asked, and corresponding new insights. We will discuss some illustrative examples, including a strengthening of the well known no-cloning theorem leading to a property of permanence for quantum information, and considerations arising from information compression that reflect on fundamental issues.

**13.    From quantum theory to classical dynamics under spontaneous wave-packet reduction**  
C. F. Huang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305146  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum master equation of the Lindblad form is obtained in this paper by considering the spontaneous wave-packet reduction. Different classical equations can be derived after exactly mapping such a quantum master equation to a continuous time random walk (CTRW). Although this CTRW is a quasiclassical walk, the effects due to the quantum interference can still be important in such a walk. Macroscopically, we shall consider the uncertainty of the potential and determine the effective transition probability by a family of Schr\"{o}dinger equations (or operators).

Peter L. Knight, Eugenio Roldan, J.E. Sipe  
Optics Communications 227, 147-157 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305165  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss how the coined quantum walk on the line or on the circle can be implemented using optical waves. We propose several optical cavity configurations for these implementations.

**15.    Polynomial Degree and Lower Bounds in Quantum Complexity: Collision and Element Distinctness with Small Range**  
Andris Ambainis  
Theory of Computing, 1:37-46, 2005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305179  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a general method for proving quantum lower bounds for problems with small range. Namely, we show that, for any symmetric problem defined on functions $f:\{1, ..., N\}\to\{1, ..., M\}$, its polynomial degree is the same for all $M\geq N$. Therefore, if we have a quantum lower bound for some (possibly, quite large) range $M$ which is shown using polynomials method, we immediately get the same lower bound for all ranges $M\geq N$. In particular, we get $\Omega(N^{1/3})$ and $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ quantum lower bounds for collision and element distinctness with small range.

**16.    Continuous-time quantum walks on the symmetric group**  
Heath Gerhardt, John Watrous  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305182  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we study continuous-time quantum walks on Cayley graphs of the symmetric group, and prove various facts concerning such walks that demonstrate significant differences from their classical analogues. In particular, we show that for several natural choices for generating sets, these quantum walks do not have uniform limiting distributions, and are effectively blind to large areas of the graphs due to destructive interference.
