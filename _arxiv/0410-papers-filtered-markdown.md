**1.    Trigonometric identities, angular Schr?dinger equations and a new family of solvable models**  
Vit Jakubsky, Miloslav Znojil, Euclides Augusto Luis, Frieder Kleefeld  
Phys.Lett.A334:154-159,2005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410023  
<blockquote>
<p>
Angular parts of certain solvable models are studied. We find that an extension of this class may be based on suitable trigonometric identities. The new exactly solvable Hamiltonians are shown to describe interesting two- and three-particle systems of the generalized Calogero, Wolfes and Winternitz-Smorodinsky types.

**2.    Local Fault-tolerant Quantum Computation**  
Krysta M. Svore, Barbara M. Terhal, David P. DiVincenzo  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 022317 (2005) (17 pages)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410047  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze and study the effects of locality on the fault-tolerance threshold for quantum computation. We analytically estimate how the threshold will depend on a scale parameter r which estimates the scale-up in the size of the circuit due to encoding. We carry out a detailed semi-numerical threshold analysis for concatenated coding using the 7-qubit CSS code in the local and `nonlocal' setting. First, we find that the threshold in the local model for the [[7,1,3]] code has a 1/r dependence, which is in correspondence with our analytical estimate. Second, the threshold, beyond the 1/r dependence, does not depend too strongly on the noise levels for transporting qubits. Beyond these results, we find that it is important to look at more than one level of concatenation in order to estimate the threshold and that it may be beneficial in certain places, like in the transportation of qubits, to do error correction only infrequently.

**3.    Stabilizing qubit coherence via tracking-control**  
Daniel A. Lidar, Sara Schneider  
Quant. Info. and Computation 5, 350 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410048  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of stabilizing the coherence of a single qubit subject to Markovian decoherence, via the application of a control Hamiltonian, without any additional resources. In this case neither quantum error correction/avoidance, nor dynamical decoupling applies. We show that using tracking-control, i.e., the conditioning of the control field on the state of the qubit, it is possible to maintain coherence for finite time durations, until the control field diverges.

**4.    Unambiguous discrimination of mixed quantum states**  
Chi Zhang, Yuan Feng, Ming Sheng Ying  
Phys. Lett. A, 353, 300-306 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410073  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a set of mixed quantum states. We first divide the density matrix of each mixed state into two parts by the fact that it comes from ensemble of pure quantum states. The first part will not contribute anything to the discrimination, the second part has support space linearly independent to each other. Then the problem we consider can be reduced to a problem in which the strategy of set discrimination can be used in designing measurements to discriminate mixed states unambiguously. We find a necessary and sufficient condition of unambiguous mixed state discrimination, and also point out that searching the optimal success probability of unambiguous discrimination is mathematically the well-known semi-definite programming problem. A upper bound of the optimal success probability is also presented. Finally, We generalize the concept of set discrimination to mixed state and point out that the problem of discriminating it unambiguously is equivalent to that of unambiguously discriminating mixed states.

**5.    Qubits in phase space: Wigner function approach to quantum error correction and the mean king problem**  
Juan Pablo Paz, Augusto Jose Roncaglia, Marcos Saraceno  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 012309 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410117  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze and further develop a new method to represent the quantum state of a system of $n$ qubits in a phase space grid of $N\times N$ points (where $N=2^n$). The method, which was recently proposed by Wootters and co--workers (Gibbons {\it et al.}, quant-ph/0401155), is based on the use of the elements of the finite field $GF(2^n)$ to label the phase space axes. We present a self--contained overview of the method, we give new insights on some of its features and we apply it to investigate problems which are of interest for quantum information theory: We analyze the phase space representation of stabilizer states and quantum error correction codes and present a phase space solution to the so--called ``mean king problem''.

**6.    Implementation of projective measurements with linear optics and continuous photon counting**  
Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki, Peter van Loock, Norbert Lütkenhaus  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 022318 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410133  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the possibility of implementing a given projection measurement using linear optics and arbitrarily fast feedforward based on the continuous detection of photons. In particular, we systematically derive the so-called Dolinar scheme that achieves the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent states. Moreover, we show that the Dolinar-type approach can also be applied to projection measurements in the regime of photonic-qubit signals. Our results demonstrate that for implementing a projection measurement with linear optics, in principle, unit success probability may be approached even without the use of expensive entangled auxiliary states, as they are needed in all known (near-)deterministic linear-optics proposals.

**7.    On the torque on birefringent plates induced by quantum fluctuations**  
Davide Iannuzzi, Jeremy N. Munday, Yuri Barash, Federico Capasso  
Phys. Rev. A71, 042102 (2005) (slightly different version)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410136  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present detailed numerical calculations of the mechanical torque induced by quantum fluctuations on two parallel birefringent plates with in plane optical anisotropy, separated by either vacuum or a liquid (ethanol). The torque is found to vary as $\sin(2\theta)$, where $\theta$ represents the angle between the two optical axes, and its magnitude rapidly increases with decreasing plate separation $d$. For a 40 $\mu$m diameter disk, made out of either quartz or calcite, kept parallel to a Barium Titanate plate at $d\simeq 100$ nm, the maximum torque (at $\theta={\pi\over 4}$) is of the order of $\simeq 10^{-19}$ N$\cdot$m. We propose an experiment to observe this torque when the Barium Titanate plate is immersed in ethanol and the other birefringent disk is placed on top of it. In this case the retarded van der Waals (or Casimir-Lifshitz) force between the two birefringent slabs is repulsive. The disk would float parallel to the plate at a distance where its net weight is counterbalanced by the retarded van der Waals repulsion, free to rotate in response to very small driving torques.

**8.    Scattering model for quantum random walk on the hypercube**  
Jozef Ko?ík, Vladimír Bu?ek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410154  
<blockquote>
<p>
We elaborate on a model of quantum random walk proposed by Hillery et. al., and Jeong et. al., which uses the multiports for quantum "coin tossing". The dynamics of this model is analyzed for the case when the multiports are arranged on the hypercube. If the hypercube is attached to semi-infinite lines, then it can act as a scattering potential, which can be reduced to a quantum walk on the line with non-unitary evolution. We also show how this model can be implemented using simple quantum gates.

**9.    Multicomplementary operators via finite Fourier transform**  
A. B. Klimov, L. L. Sanchez-Soto, H. de Guise  
Journal of Physics A 38, 2747--2760 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410155  
<blockquote>
<p>
A complete set of d+1 mutually unbiased bases exists in a Hilbert spaces of dimension d, whenever d is a power of a prime. We discuss a simple construction of d+1 disjoint classes (each one having d-1 commuting operators) such that the corresponding eigenstates form sets of unbiased bases. Such a construction works properly for prime dimension. We investigate an alternative construction in which the real numbers that label the classes are replaced by a finite field having d elements. One of these classes is diagonal, and can be mapped to cyclic operators by means of the finite Fourier transform, which allows one to understand complementarity in a similar way as for the position-momentum pair in standard quantum mechanics. The relevant examples of two and three qubits and two qutrits are discussed in detail.

**10.    Nonlinear optics with stationary pulses of light**  
A. Andre, M. Bajcsy, A. S. Zibrov, M. D. Lukin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the recently demonstrated technique for generating stationary pulses of light [Nature {\bf 426}, 638 (2003)] can be extended to localize optical pulses in all three spatial dimensions in a resonant atomic medium. This method can be used to dramatically enhance the nonlinear interaction between weak optical pulses. In particular, we show that an efficient Kerr-like interaction between two pulses can be implemented as a sequence of several purely linear optical processes. The resulting process may enable coherent interactions between single photon pulses.

**11.    Exact supersymmetry in the relativistic hydrogen atom in general dimensions -- supercharge and the generalized Johnson-Lippmann operator**  
Hosho Katsura, Hideo Aoki  
J.Math.Phys. 47 (2006) 032301  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410174  
<blockquote>
<p>
A Dirac particle in general dimensions moving in a 1/r potential is shown to have an exact N = 2 supersymmetry, for which the two supercharge operators are obtained in terms of (a D-dimensional generalization of) the Johnson-Lippmann operator, an extension of the Runge-Lenz-Pauli vector that relativistically incorporates spin degrees of freedom. So the extra symmetry (S(2))in the quantum Kepler problem, which determines the degeneracy of the levels, is so robust as to accommodate the relativistic case in arbitrary dimensions.

**12.    A proposal for the implementation of quantum gates with photonic-crystal coupled cavity waveguides**  
Dimitris G. Angelakis, Marcelo Franca Santos, Vassilis Yannopapas, Artur Ekert  
Phys. Lett. A. 362, 377 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410189  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers require technologies that offer both sufficient control over coherent quantum phenomena and minimal spurious interactions with the environment. We show, that photons confined to photonic crystals, and in particular to highly efficient waveguides formed from linear chains of defects doped with atoms can generate strong non-linear interactions which allow to implement both single and two qubit quantum gates. The simplicity of the gate switching mechanism, the experimental feasibility of fabricating two dimensional photonic crystal structures and integrability of this device with optoelectronics offers new interesting possibilities for optical quantum information processing networks.

**13.    Single-qubit optical quantum fingerprinting**  
Rolf T. Horn, S. A. Babichev, Karl-Peter Marzlin, A. I. Lvovsky, Barry C. Sanders  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 150502 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410232  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze and demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of linear optical single-qubit fingerprinting over its classical counterpart. For one-qubit fingerprinting of two-bit messages, we prepare `tetrahedral' qubit states experimentally and show that they meet the requirements for quantum fingerprinting to exceed the classical capability. We prove that shared entanglement permits 100% reliable quantum fingerprinting, which will outperform classical fingerprinting even with arbitrary amounts of shared randomness.

**14.    Slow transport by continuous time quantum walks**  
Oliver Muelken, Alexander Blumen  
Phys. Rev. E 71, 016101 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410243  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) do not necessarily perform better than their classical counterparts, the continuous time random walks (CTRW). For one special graph, where a recent analysis showed that in a particular direction of propagation the penetration of the graph is faster by CTQWs than by CTRWs, we demonstrate that in another direction of propagation the opposite is true; In this case a CTQW initially localized at one site displays a slow transport. We furthermore show that when the CTQW's initial condition is a totally symmetric superposition of states of equivalent sites, the transport gets to be much more rapid.

**15.    Experimental Realization of a Photonic Bell-State Analyzer**  
Philip Walther, Anton Zeilinger  
Physical Review A 72 010302(R) (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410244  
<blockquote>
<p>
Efficient teleportation is a crucial step for quantum computation and quantum networking. In the case of qubits, four different entangled Bell states have to be distinguished. We have realized a probabilistic, but in principle deterministic, Bell-state analyzer for two photonic quantum bits by the use of a nondestructive controlled-NOT gate based on entirely linear optical elements. This gate was capable of distinguishing between all of the Bell states with higher than 75% fidelity without any noise substraction due to utilizing quantum interference effects.

**16.    Neutrix Calculus and Finite Quantum Field Theory**  
Y. Jack Ng, H. van Dam  
J.Phys. A38 (2005) L317  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0410285  
<blockquote>
<p>
In general, quantum field theories (QFT) require regularizations and infinite renormalizations due to ultraviolet divergences in their loop calculations. Furthermore, perturbation series in theories like QED are not convergent series, but are asymptotic series. We apply neutrix calculus, developed in connection with asymptotic series and divergent integrals, to QFT,obtaining finite renormalizations. While none of the physically measurable results in renormalizable QFT is changed, quantum gravity is rendered more manageable in the neutrix framework.

**17.    Spontaneous decay rates in active waveguides**  
A. A. Rieznik, G. Rigolin  
Opt. Lett. 30, 1108 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0410040  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new method to measure the guided, radiated and total decay rates in one-dimensional waveguides. It is also theoretically shown that large modifications of the total decay rate can be achieved in realistic EDFAs and EDWAs with effective mode area radii smaller than ~ 1 micrometer.
