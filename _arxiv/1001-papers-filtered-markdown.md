**1.    Quantum Fluctuations Contribution to the Random Walk of a Single Molecule and New Estimate of the Planck Constant**  
Jean Paul Mbelek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0342  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown, by considering the case of the harmonic oscillator, that quantum fluctuations may be the most significant contribution to the random walk of a single molecule. From this point, the controversy on the existence of a standard quantum limit (SQL) is addressed and settled on the experimental ground. Comparisons to the experimental data yet avalaible in the literature provide a new estimate of the reduced Planck constant yielding \hbar = (1.1 \pm 0.2) ~ 10^{-34} J.s.

**2.    Algorithms for Quantum Computers**  
Jamie Smith, Michele Mosca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0767  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper surveys the field of quantum computer algorithms. It gives a taste of both the breadth and the depth of the known algorithms for quantum computers, focusing on some of the more recent results. It begins with a brief review of quantum Fourier transform based algorithms, followed by quantum searching and some of its early generalizations. It continues with a more in-depth description of two more recent developments: algorithms developed in the quantum walk paradigm, followed by tensor network evaluation algorithms (which include approximating the Tutte polynomial).

**3.    Quantum Annealing with Jarzynski Equality (CCP2009)**  
Masayuki Ohzeki, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0836  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a practical application of an well-known nonequilibrium relation, the Jarzynski equality, in quantum computation. Its implementation may open a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems, minimization of a real single-valued function, cost function, with many arguments. It has been disclosed that the ordinary quantum computational algorithm to solve a kind of hard optimization problems, has a bottleneck that its computational time is restricted to be extremely slow without relevant errors. However, by our novel strategy shown in the present study, we might overcome such a difficulty.

**4.    From quantum feedback to probabilistic error correction: Manipulation of quantum beats in cavity QED**  
P. Barberis-Blostein, D. G. Norris, L. A. Orozco, H. J. Carmichael  
New J. Phys. 12 023002 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0952  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown how to implement quantum feedback and probabilistic error correction in an open quantum system consisting of a single atom, with ground- and excited-state Zeeman structure, in a driven two-mode optical cavity. The ground state superposition is manipulated and controlled through conditional measurements and external fields, which shield the coherence and correct quantum errors. Modeling of an experimentally realistic situation demonstrates the robustness of the proposal for realization in the laboratory.

**5.    Photon scattering by a three-level emitter in a one-dimensional waveguide**  
D. Witthaut, A. S. Sorensen  
New J. Phys 12, 043052 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0975  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the scattering of photons from a three-level emitter in a one-dimensional waveguide, where the transport is governed by the interference of spontaneously emitted and directly transmitted waves. The scattering problem is solved in closed form for different level structures. Several possible applications are discussed: The state of the emitter can be switched deterministically by Raman scattering, thus enabling applications in quantum computing such as a single photon transistor. An array of emitters gives rise to a photonic band gap structure, which can be tuned by a classical driving laser. A disordered array leads to Anderson localization of photons, where the localization length can again be controlled by an external driving.

**6.    Optical analogue of population trapping in the continuum: classical and quantum interference effects**  
S. Longhi  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 023811 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1000  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum theory of light propagation in two optical channel waveguides tunnelling-coupled to a common continuum of modes (such as those of a slab waveguide) is presented, and classical and quantum interference effects are investigated. For classical light, the photonic system realizes an optical analogue of coherent population trapping in the continuum encountered in atomic physics, where destructive interference between different light leakage channels leads to the appearance of a trapped state embedded in the continuum. For nonclassical light, two-photon interference effects are predicted, such as the tendency of photon pairs to bunch when decaying into the continuum.

**7.    Mixing-time and large-decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks on one-dimension regular networks**  
S. Salimi, R. Radgohar  
Quantum Inf Process 12, 303-320(2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1034  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study mixing and large decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks on one dimensional regular networks, which are constructed by connecting each node to its $2l$ nearest neighbors($l$ on either side). In our investigation, the nodes of network are represented by a set of identical tunnel-coupled quantum dots in which decoherence is induced by continuous monitoring of each quantum dot with nearby point contact detector. To formulate the decoherent CTQWs, we use Gurvitz model and then calculate probability distribution and the bounds of instantaneous and average mixing times. We show that the mixing times are linearly proportional to the decoherence rate. Moreover, adding links to cycle network, in appearance of large decoherence, decreases the mixing times.

**8.    Spatial search in a honeycomb network**  
G. Abal, R. Donangelo, F.L. Marquezino, R. Portugal  
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, v. 20, p. 999-1009, 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1139  
<blockquote>
<p>
The spatial search problem consists in minimizing the number of steps required to find a given site in a network, under the restriction that only oracle queries or translations to neighboring sites are allowed. In this paper, a quantum algorithm for the spatial search problem on a honeycomb lattice with $N$ sites and torus-like boundary conditions. The search algorithm is based on a modified quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice and the general framework proposed by Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh is used to show that the time complexity of this quantum search algorithm is $O(\sqrt{N \log N})$.

**9.    Using adiabatic coupling techniques in atom-chip waveguide structures**  
B. O'Sullivan, P. Morrissey, T. Morgan, Th. Busch  
Phys. Scr. T140, 014029 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1331  
<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic techniques are well known tools in multi-level electron systems to transfer population between different states with high fidelity. Recently it has been realised that these ideas can also be used in ultra-cold atom systems to achieve coherent manipulation of the atomic centre-of-mass states. Here we present an investigation into a realistic setup using three atomic waveguides created on top of an atom chip and show that such systems hold large potential for the observation of adiabatic phenomena in experiments.

**10.    Efficient Optimal Minimum Error Discrimination of Symmetric Quantum States**  
Antonio Assalini, Gianfranco Cariolaro, Gianfranco Pierobon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1385  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper deals with the quantum optimal discrimination among mixed quantum states enjoying geometrical uniform symmetry with respect to a reference density operator $\rho_0$. It is well-known that the minimal error probability is given by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) obtained as a solution of a convex optimization problem, namely a set of operators satisfying geometrical symmetry, with respect to a reference operator $\Pi_0$, and maximizing $\textrm{Tr}(\rho_0 \Pi_0)$. In this paper, by resolving the dual problem, we show that the same result is obtained by minimizing the trace of a semidefinite positive operator $X$ commuting with the symmetry operator and such that $X >= \rho_0$. The new formulation gives a deeper insight into the optimization problem and allows to obtain closed-form analytical solutions, as shown by a simple but not trivial explanatory example. Besides the theoretical interest, the result leads to semidefinite programming solutions of reduced complexity, allowing to extend the numerical performance evaluation to quantum communication systems modeled in Hilbert spaces of large dimension.

**11.    Distributed Quantum Programming**  
Ellie D'Hondt, Yves Vandriessche  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1722  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we explore the structure and applicability of the Distributed Measurement Calculus (DMC), an assembly language for distributed measurement-based quantum computations. We describe the formal language's syntax and semantics, both operational and denotational, and state several properties that are crucial to the practical usability of our language, such as equivalence of our semantics, as well as compositionality and context-freeness of DMC programs. We show how to put these properties to use by constructing a composite program that implements distributed controlled operations, in the knowledge that the semantics of this program does not change under the various composition operations. Our formal model is the basis of a quantum virtual machine construction for distributed quantum computations, which we elaborate upon in the latter part of this work. This virtual machine embodies the formal semantics of DMC such that programming execution no longer needs to be analysed by hand. Far from a literal translation, it requires a substantial concretisation of the formal model at the level of data structures, naming conventions and abstraction mechanisms. At the same time we provide automatisation techniques for program specification where possible to obtain an expressive and user-friendly programming environment.

**12.    Constraining the Correlation Distance in Quantum Measurements**  
Jean Schneider  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2135  
<blockquote>
<p>
Standard Quantum Physics states that the outcome of measurements for some distant entangled subsystems are instantaneously statistically correlated, whatever their mutual distance. This correlation presents itself as if there were a correlation at a distance with infinite speed. It is expressed by the Bell Theorem. It has been experimentally verified over distances up to 18 km with a time resolution of a few picosecond, which can be translated into an apparent effective correlation speed larger than 10^7 c. The purpose of the present White Paper is to discuss the scientific interest and the feasibility to extend the correlation distance up to the Earth-Moon distance, i.e. 2 10^4 times larger than in present experiments. We are thus led to propose to install on the Moon a polarimter and a high performance photon detector with a high temporal resolution. Such an exploratory experiment would provide new tests of Quantum Physics and could perhaps discriminate between standard Quantum Physics and for instance the Bohmian theory.

**13.    Quantum Analogue Computing**  
Vivien M. Kendon, Kae Nemoto, William J. Munro  
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A August 13, 2010 368:3621-3632  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2215  
<blockquote>
<p>
We briefly review what a quantum computer is, what it promises to do for us, and why it is so hard to build one. Among the first applications anticipated to bear fruit is quantum simulation of quantum systems. While most quantum computation is an extension of classical digital computation, quantum simulation differs fundamentally in how the data is encoded in the quantum computer. To perform a quantum simulation, the Hilbert space of the system to be simulated is mapped directly onto the Hilbert space of the (logical) qubits in the quantum computer. This type of direct correspondence is how data is encoded in a classical analogue computer. There is no binary encoding, and increasing precision becomes exponentially costly: an extra bit of precision doubles the size of the computer. This has important consequences for both the precision and error correction requirements of quantum simulation, and significant open questions remain about its practicality. It also means that the quantum version of analogue computers, continuous variable quantum computers (CVQC) becomes an equally efficient architecture for quantum simulation. Lessons from past use of classical analogue computers can help us to build better quantum simulators in future.

**14.    Optical Trapping of an Ion**  
Ch. Schneider, M. Enderlein, T. Huber, T. Schaetz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2953  
<blockquote>
<p>
For several decades, ions have been trapped by radio frequency (RF) and neutral particles by optical fields. We implement the experimental proof-of-principle for trapping an ion in an optical dipole trap. While loading, initialization and final detection are performed in a RF trap, in between, this RF trap is completely disabled and substituted by the optical trap. The measured lifetime of milliseconds allows for hundreds of oscillations within the optical potential. It is mainly limited by heating due to photon scattering. In future experiments the lifetime may be increased by further detuning the laser and cooling the ion. We demonstrate the prerequisite to merge both trapping techniques in hybrid setups to the point of trapping ions and atoms in the same optical potential.

**15.    Entanglement of Periodic States, the Quantum Fourier Transform and Shor's Factoring Algorithm**  
Yonatan Most, Yishai Shimoni, Ofer Biham  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 052306 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3145  
<blockquote>
<p>
The preprocessing stage of Shor's algorithm generates a class of quantum states referred to as periodic states, on which the quantum Fourier transform is applied. Such states also play an important role in other quantum algorithms that rely on the quantum Fourier transform. Since entanglement is believed to be a necessary resource for quantum computational speedup, we analyze the entanglement of periodic states and the way it is affected by the quantum Fourier transform. To this end, we derive a formula that evaluates the Groverian entanglement measure for periodic states. Using this formula, we explain the surprising result that the Groverian entanglement of the periodic states built up during the preprocessing stage is only slightly affected by the quantum Fourier transform.

**16.    Non-Markovian effect on the geometric phase of a dissipative qubit**  
Juan-Juan Chen, Jun-Hong An, Qing-Jun Tong, Hong-Gang Luo, C. H. Oh  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 022120 (2010).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3454  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the geometric phase of a two-level atom coupled to an environment with Lorentzian spectral density. The non-Markovian effect on the geometric phase is explored analytically and numerically. In the weak coupling limit the lowest-order correction to the geometric phase is derived analytically and the general case is calculated numerically. It is found that the correction to the geometric phase is significantly large if the spectral width is small and in this case the non-Markovian dynamics has a significant impact to the geometric phase. When the spectral width increases, the correction to the geometric phase becomes negligible, which shows the robustness of the geometric phase to the environmental white noises. The result is significant to the quantum information processing based on the geometric phase.

**17.    Non-Markovian dynamics of a damped driven two-state system**  
Pinja Haikka, Sabrina Maniscalco  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 052103 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3564  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a driven two-state system interacting with a structured environment. We introduce the non-Markovian master equation ruling the system dynamics, and we derive its analytic solution for general reservoir spectra. We compare the non-Markovian dynamics of the Bloch vector for two classes of reservoir spectra: the Ohmic and the Lorentzian reservoir. Finally, we derive the analytic conditions for complete positivity with and without the secular approximation. Interestingly, the complete positivity conditions have a transparent physical interpretation in terms of the characteristic timescales of phase diffusion and relaxation processes.

**18.    Jump probabilities in the non-Markovian quantum jump method**  
Kari Harkonen  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 (2010) 065302  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3566  
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of a non-Markovian open quantum system described by a general time-local master equation is studied. The propagation of the density operator is constructed in terms of two processes: (i) deterministic evolution and (ii) evolution of a probability density functional in the projective Hilbert space. The analysis provides a derivation for the jump probabilities used in the recently developed non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) method (Piilo et al 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 180402).

<p>
Quantum walks are powerful tools not only to construct the quantum speedup algorithms but also to describe specific models in physical processes. Furthermore, the discrete time quantum walk has been experimentally realized in various setups. We apply the concept of the quantum walk to the problems in quantum foundations. We show that randomness and the arrow of time in the quantum walk gradually emerge by periodic projective measurements from the mathematically obtained limit distribution under the time scale transformation.

**20.    Non-Markovian reservoir-dependent squeezing**  
J. Paavola  
Phys. Scr. T140, 014030 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4669  
<blockquote>
<p>
The squeezing dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator are studied for different types of environment without making the Markovian approximation. The squeezing dynamics of a coherent state depend on the reservoir spectrum in a unique way that can, in the weak coupling approximation, be analyzed analytically. Comparison of squeezing dynamics for Ohmic, sub-Ohmic and super-Ohmic environments is done showing a clear connection between the squeezing--non-squeezing oscillations and reservoir structure. Understanding the effects occurring due to structured reservoirs is important both from a purely theoretical point of view and in connection with evolving experimental techniques and future quantum computing applications.

**21.    Dynamics and quantum Zeno effect for a qubit in either a low- or high-frequency bath: A non-markovian approach beyond the rotating-wave approximation**  
Xiufeng Cao, J. Q. You, H. Zheng, Franco Nori  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 022119 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4831  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use a non-Markovian approach to study the decoherence dynamics of a qubit in either a low- or high-frequency bath modeling the qubit environment. This approach is based on a unitary transformation and does not require the rotating-wave approximation. We show that for low-frequency noise, the bath shifts the qubit energy towards higher energies (blue shift), while the ordinary high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath shifts the qubit energy towards lower energies (red shift). In order to preserve the coherence of the qubit, we also investigate the quantum Zeno effect in two cases: low- and high-frequency baths. For very frequent projective measurements, the low-frequency bath gives rise to the quantum anti-Zeno effect on the qubit. The quantum Zeno effect only occurs in the high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath, after considering counter-rotating terms. For a high-frequency environment, the decay rate should be faster (without frequent measurements) or slower (with frequent measurements, in the Zeno regime), compared to the low-frequency bath case. The experimental implementation of our results here could distinguish the type of bath (either a low- or high-frequency one) and protect the coherence of the qubit by modulating the dominant frequency of its environment.

**22.    An Adaptive, Fixed-Point Version of Grover's Algorithm**  
Robert R. Tucci  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5200  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give an adaptive, fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. By this we mean that our algorithm performs an infinite sequence of gradually diminishing steps (so we say it's adaptive) that drives the starting state to the target state with absolute certainty (so we say it's a fixed-point algorithm). Our algorithm is motivated by Bloch sphere geometry. We include with the ArXiv distribution of this paper some simple software (Octave/Matlab m-files) that implements, tests and illustrates some of the results of this paper.

**23.    Discrete-Time Quantum Walk - Dynamics and Applications**  
C.M. Chandrashekar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5326  
<blockquote>
<p>
This dissertation presents investigations on dynamics of discrete-time quantum walk and some of its applications. Quantum walks has been exploited as an useful tool for quantum algorithms in quantum computing. Beyond quantum computational purposes, it has been used to explain and control the dynamics in various physical systems. In order to use the quantum walk to its fullest potential, it is important to know and optimize the properties purely due to quantum dynamics and in presence of noise. Various studies of its dynamics in the absence and presence of noise have been reported. We propose new approaches to optimize the dynamics, discuss symmetries and effect of noise on the quantum walk. Making use of its properties, we propose the use of quantum walk as an efficient new tool for various applications in physical systems and quantum information processing. In the first and second part of this dissertation, we discuss evolution process of the quantum walks, propose and demonstrate the optimization of discrete-time quantum walk using quantum coin operation from SU(2) group and discuss some of its properties. We investigate symmetry operations and environmental effects on dynamics of the walk on a line and an n-cycle highlighting the interplay between noise and topology. Using the properties and behavior of quantum walk discussed in part two, in part three we propose the application of quantum walk to realize quantum phase transition in optical lattice, that is to efficiently control and redistribute ultracold atoms in optical lattice. We also discuss the implementation scheme. Another application we consider is creation of spatial entanglement using quantum walk on a quantum many body system.

Janine Riedrich-M?ller, Elke Neu, Christoph Becher  
Photon. Nanostruct.: Fundam. Appl., 8, 150-162 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0456  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the design of two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities in thin diamond membranes well suited for coupling of color centers in diamond. By comparing simulated and ideal field distributions in Fourier and real space and by according modification of air hole positions and size, we optimize the cavity structure yielding high quality factors up to Q = 320000 with a modal volume of V = 0.35 (lambda/n)^3. Using the very same approach we also improve previous designs of a small modal volume microcavity in silicon, gaining a factor of 3 in cavity Q. In view of practical realization of photonic crystals in synthetic diamond films, it is necessary to investigate the influence of material absorption on the quality factor. We show that this influence can be predicted by a simple model, replacing time consuming simulations.

Sanchari Goswami, Parongama Sen, Arnab Das  
Phys. Rev. E 81, 021121 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5131  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we extend the concept of persistence, well defined for classical stochastic dynamics, to the context of quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the idea via quantum random walk and a successive measurement scheme, where persistence is defined as the time during which a given site remains unvisited by the walker. We also investigated the behavior of related quantities, e.g., the first-passage time and the succession probability (newly defined), etc. The study reveals power law scaling behavior of these quantities with new exponents. Comparable features of the classical and the quantum walks are discussed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5108  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photosynthetic antenna complexes capture and concentrate solar radiation by transferring the excitation to the reaction center which stores energy from the photon in chemical bonds. This process occurs with near-perfect quantum efficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that coherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both incoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that environmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological temperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a quantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum coherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we present the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at physiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a rudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the wave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to biological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime to correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores, and we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears constant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and mediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The persistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these conditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum computational devices that can operate at high temperature.

Xian-Ting Liang  
Phys. Rev. E 82, 051918 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0809  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a model to mimic the excitation energy transfer (EET) between chromophores in photosynthesis systems. The numerical path integral method is used. This method includes the non-Markovian effects of the environmental affects and it does not need the perturbation approximation in solving the dynamics of systems of interest. It implies that the coherence helps the EET between chromophores through lasting the transfer time rather than enhances the transfer rate of the EET. In particular, the non-Markovian environment greatly increase the efficiency of the EET in the photosynthesis systems.
