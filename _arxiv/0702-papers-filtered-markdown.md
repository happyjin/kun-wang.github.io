**1.    How good must single photon sources and detectors be for efficient linear optical quantum computation?**  
M. Varnava, D.E. Browne, T. Rudolph  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 060502 (2008).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702044  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme for linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) which is highly robust to imperfect single photon sources and inefficient detectors. In particular we show that if the product of the detector efficiency with the source efficiency is greater than 2/3, then efficient LOQC is possible. This threshold is many orders of magnitude more relaxed than those which could be inferred by application of standard results in fault tolerance. The result is achieved within the cluster state paradigm for quantum computation.

**2.    Entanglement oscillations in non-Markovian quantum channels**  
Sabrina Maniscalco, Stefano Olivares, Matteo G. A. Paris  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 062119 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702055  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-mode bosonic system interacting with two uncorrelated thermal bosonic reservoirs. We present the solution to the exact microscopic Master equation in terms of the quantum characteristic function and study in details the dynamics of entanglement for bipartite Gaussian states. In particular, we analyze the effects of short-time system-reservoir correlations on the separability thresholds and show that the relevant parameter is the reservoir spectral density. If the frequencies of the involved modes are within the reservoir spectral density entanglement persists for a longer time than in a Markovian channel. On the other hand, when the reservoir spectrum is out of resonance short-time correlations lead to a faster decoherence and to the appearance of entanglement oscillations.

**3.    Comment on ``Lateral Casimir force beyond the proximity-force approximation''**  
F.Chen, U.Mohideen, G.L.Klimchitskaya, V.M.Mostepanenko  
Phys.Rev.Lett.98:068901,2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702060  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that the approach by Rodrigues et al. (PRL, v.96, 100402, 2006) to the description of the lateral Casimir force between corrugated surfaces is in disagreement with a path-integral theory by Emig et al. (PRA, v.67, 022114, 2003), and the approximations used are not appropriate for comparison to experiment.

**4.    Theory of quantum fluctuations of optical dissipative structures and its application to the squeezing properties of bright cavity solitons**  
Isabel Perez-Arjona, Eugenio Roldan, German J. de Valcarcel  
Physical Review A 75, 063802 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702070  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method for the study of quantum fluctuations of dissipative structures forming in nonlinear optical cavities, which we illustrate in the case of a degenerate, type I optical parametric oscillator. The method consists in (i) taking into account explicitly, through a collective variable description, the drift of the dissipative structure caused by the quantum noise, and (ii) expanding the remaining -internal- fluctuations in the biorthonormal basis associated to the linear operator governing the evolution of fluctuations in the linearized Langevin equations. We obtain general expressions for the squeezing and intensity fluctuations spectra. Then we theoretically study the squeezing properties of a special dissipative structure, namely, the bright cavity soliton. After reviewing our previous result that in the linear approximation there is a perfectly squeezed mode irrespectively of the values of the system parameters, we consider squeezing at the bifurcation points, and the squeezing detection with a plane--wave local oscillator field, taking also into account the effect of the detector size on the level of detectable squeezing.

**5.    Markovian Entanglement Networks**  
Pierfrancesco La Mura, Lukasz Swiatczak  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702072  
<blockquote>
<p>
Graphical models of probabilistic dependencies have been extensively investigated in the context of classical uncertainty. However, in some domains (most notably, in computational physics and quantum computing) the nature of the relevant uncertainty is non-classical, and the laws of classical probability theory are superseded by those of quantum mechanics. In this paper we introduce Markovian Entanglement Networks (MEN), a novel class of graphical representations of quantum-mechanical dependencies in the context of such non-classical systems. MEN are the quantum-mechanical analogue of Markovian Networks, a family of undirected graphical representations which, in the classical domain, exploit a notion of conditional independence among subsystems. After defining a notion of conditional independence appropriate to our domain (conditional separability), we prove that the conditional separabilities induced by a quantum-mechanical wave function are effectively reflected in the graphical structure of MEN. Specifically, we show that for any wave function there exists a MEN which is a perfect map of its conditional separabilities. Next, we show how the graphical structure of MEN can be used to effectively classify the pure states of three-qubit systems. We also demonstrate that, in large systems, exploiting conditional independencies may dramatically reduce the computational burden of various inference tasks. In principle, the graph-theoretic representation of conditional independencies afforded by MEN may not only facilitate the classical simulation of quantum systems, but also provide a guide to the efficient design and complexity analysis of quantum algorithms and circuits.

**6.    Krawtchouk polynomials and Krawtchouk matrices**  
Philip Feinsilver, Jerzy Kocik  
Recent advances in applied probability, Springer-Verlag, October, 2004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702073  
<blockquote>
<p>
Krawtchouk matrices have as entries values of the Krawtchouk polynomials for nonnegative integer arguments. We show how they arise as condensed Sylvester-Hadamard matrices via a binary shuffling function. The underlying symmetric tensor algebra is presented. Our approach is used to solve Kac' formulation of the Ehrenfest urn model. Connections with quantum and classical random walks are shown as well as various extensions of the classical polynomials.

**7.    Protecting an optical qubit against photon loss**  
Wojciech Wasilewski, Konrad Banaszek  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 042316 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702075  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum error-correction codes for multimode bosonic systems, such as optical fields, that are affected by amplitude damping. Such a process is a generalization of an erasure channel. We demonstrate that the most accessible method of transforming optical systems with the help of passive linear networks has limited usefulness in preparing and manipulating such codes. These limitations stem directly from the recoverability condition for one-photon loss. We introduce a three-photon code protecting against the first order of amplitude damping, i.e. a single photon loss, and discuss its preparation using linear optics with single-photon sources and conditional detection. Quantum state and process tomography in the code subspace can be implemented using passive linear optics and photon counting. An experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of elements of the proposed quantum error correction scheme for a one-photon erasure lies well within present technological capabilites.

**8.    Conditional generation of an arbitrary superposition of coherent states**  
Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 064302 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702126  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme to conditionally generate an arbitrary superposition of a pair of coherent states from a squeezed vacuum by means of the modified photon subtraction where a coherent state ancilla and two on/off type detectors are used. We show that, even including realistic imperfections of the detectors, our scheme can generate a target state with a high fidelity. The amplitude of the generated states can be amplified by conditional homodyne detections.

**9.    Observation of -9 dB quadrature squeezing with improvement of phase stability in homodyne measurement**  
Yuishi Takeno, Mitsuyoshi Yukawa, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Akira Furusawa  
Optics Express 15, 4321 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702139  
<blockquote>
<p>
We observe -9.01$\pm$0.14 dB of squeezing and +15.12$\pm$0.14 dB of antisqueezing with a local oscillator phase locked in homodyne measurement. In reference [1], two main factors are pointed out which degrade the observed squeezing level: phase fluctuation in homodyne measurement and intracavity losses of an optical parametric oscillator for squeezing. We have improved the phase stability of homodyne measurement and have reduced the intracavity losses. We measure pump power dependences of the squeezing and antisqueezing levels, which show good agreement with theoretical calculations taking account of the phase fluctuation.

<blockquote>
<p>
We give a quantum algorithm for the binary NAND tree problem in the Hamiltonian oracle model. The algorithm uses a continuous time quantum walk with a run time proportional to sqrt N. We also show a lower bound of sqrt N for the NAND tree problem in the Hamiltonian oracle model.

**11.    Discrete-query quantum algorithm for NAND trees**  
Andrew M. Childs, Richard Cleve, Stephen P. Jordan, David Yeung  
Theory of Computing, Vol. 5 (2009) 119-123  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702160  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann gave a quantum algorithm for evaluating NAND trees that runs in time O(sqrt(N log N)) in the Hamiltonian query model. In this note, we point out that their algorithm can be converted into an algorithm using O(N^{1/2 + epsilon}) queries in the conventional quantum query model, for any fixed epsilon > 0.

**12.    Krawtchouk matrices from classical and quantum random walks**  
Philip Feinsilver, Jerzy Kocik  
Contemporary Mathematics, Volume 287 (2001) 83-96  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702173  
<blockquote>
<p>
Krawtchouk's polynomials occur classically as orthogonal polynomials with respect to the binomial distribution. They may be also expressed in the form of matrices, that emerge as arrays of the values that the polynomials take. The algebraic properties of these matrices provide a very interesting and accessible example in the approach to probability theory known as quantum probability. First it is noted how the Krawtchouk matrices are connected to the classical symmetric Bernoulli random walk. And we show how to derive Krawtchouk matrices in the quantum probability context via tensor powers of the elementary Hadamard matrix. Then connections with the classical situation are shown by calculating expectation values in the quantum case.

**13.    Groverian Entanglement Measure of Pure Quantum States with Arbitrary Partitions**  
Yishai Shimoni, Ofer Biham  
Phys. Rev. A. 75, 022308(2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702179  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Groverian entanglement measure of pure quantum states of $n$ qubits is generalized to the case in which the qubits are divided into any $m \le n$ parties and the entanglement between these parties is evaluated. To demonstrate this measure we apply it to general states of three qubits and to symmetric states with any number of qubits such as the Greenberg-Horne-Zeiliner state and the W state.

**14.    Constructing CSS Codes with LDPC Codes for the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol**  
Maki Ohata, Kanta Matsuura  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702184  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we propose how to simply construct a pair of linear codes for the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol. This protocol allows unconditional security in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the pair of linear codes is used for error correction and privacy amplification. Since their high decoding performance implies low eavesdropper's mutual information, good design of the two codes is required. The proposed method admits using arbitrary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Therefore, it has low complexity and high performance for hardware implementation. Simulation results show that the pair of codes performs well against practical and various noise levels.

**15.    Scaling and better approximating quantum Fourier transform by higher radices**  
Zeljko Zilic, Katarzyna Radecka  
IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 202-207, February 2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702195  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) plays a principal role in the development of efficient quantum algorithms. Since the number of quantum bits that can currently built is limited, while many quantum technologies are inherently three- (or more) valued, we consider extending the reach of the realistic quantum systems by building a QFT over ternary quantum digits. Compared to traditional binary QFT, the q-valued transform improves approximation properties and increases the state space by a factor of (q/2)n. Further, we use non-binary QFT derivation to generalize and improve the approximation bounds for QFT.

**16.    Purple bacteria and quantum Fourier transform**  
Samir Lipovaca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702203  
<blockquote>
<p>
The LH-II of purple bacteria Rhodospirillum (Rs.) molischianum and Rhodopseudomonas (Rps.) acidophila adopts a highly symmetrical ring shape, with a radius of about 7 nm. In the case of Rps. acidophila the ring has a ninefold symmetry axis, and in LH-II from Rs. molischianum the ring has an eightfold symmetry axis. These rings are found to exibit two bands of excitons. A simplified mathematical description of the exciton states is given in Hu, X. & Schulten, K. (1997) Physics Today 50, 28-34. Using this description, we will show, by suitable labeling of the lowest energy (Qy) excited states of individual BChls, that the resulting exciton states are the quantum Fourier transform of the BChls excited states. For Rs. molischianum ring exciton states will be modeled as the four qubit quantum Fourier transform and the explicit circuit will be derived. Exciton states for Rps. acidophila ring cannot be modeled with an integer number of qubits. Both quantum Fourier transforms are instances of the hidden subgroup problem and this opens up a possibility that both purple bacteria implement an efficient quantum circuit for light harvesting.

**17.    Accidental cloning of a single-photon qubit in two-channel continuous-variable quantum teleportation**  
Toshiki Ide, Holger F. Hofmann  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 062311 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702204  
<blockquote>
<p>
The information encoded in the polarization of a single photon can be transferred to a remote location by two-channel continuous-variable quantum teleportation. However, the finite entanglement used in the teleportation causes random changes in photon number. If more than one photon appears in the output, the continuous-variable teleportation accidentally produces clones of the original input photon. In this paper, we derive the polarization statistics of the $N$-photon output components and show that they can be decomposed into an optimal cloning term and completely unpolarized noise. We find that the accidental cloning of the input photon is nearly optimal at experimentally feasible squeezing levels, indicating that the loss of polarization information is partially compensated by the availability of clones.

**18.    Quantum annealing of the random-field Ising model by transverse ferromagnetic interactions**  
Sei Suzuki, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Masuo Suzuki  
Phys. Rev. E 75, 051112 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702214  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce transverse ferromagnetic interactions, in addition to a simple transverse field, to quantum annealing of the random-field Ising model to accelerate convergence toward the target ground state. The conventional approach using only the transverse-field term is known to be plagued by slow convergence when the true ground state has strong ferromagnetic characteristics for the random-field Ising model. The transverse ferromagnetic interactions are shown to improve the performance significantly in such cases. This conclusion is drawn from the analyses of the energy eigenvalues of instantaneous stationary states as well as by the very fast algorithm of Bethe-type mean-field annealing adopted to quantum systems. The present study highlights the importance of a flexible choice of the type of quantum fluctuations to achieve the best possible performance in quantum annealing. The existence of such flexibility is an outstanding advantage of quantum annealing over simulated annealing.

**19.    Experimental Demonstration of Macroscopic Quantum Coherence in Gaussian States**  
Christoph Marquardt, Ulrik L. Andersen, Gerd Leuchs, Yuishi Takeno, Mitsuyoshi Yukawa, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Akira Furusawa  
Phys. Rev. A, 76 (3), 030101 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702215  
<blockquote>
<p>
We witness experimentally the presence of macroscopic coherence in Gaussian quantum states using a recently proposed criterion (E.G. Cavalcanti and M. Reid, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 170405 (2006)). The macroscopic coherence stems from interference between macroscopically distinct states in phase space and we prove experimentally that even the vacuum state contains these features with a distance in phase space of $0.51\pm0.02$ shot noise units (SNU). For squeezed states we found macroscopic superpositions with a distance of up to $0.83\pm0.02$ SNU. The proof of macroscopic quantum coherence was investigated with respect to squeezing and purity of the states.

**20.    Evolution of Entanglement in Groverian Search Algorithm: n-qudit System**  
Arti Chamoli, C. M. Bhandari  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702222  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum processes particularly those pertaining to quantum information and computation. An analytical expression for an entanglement measure defined in terms of success rate of Grover's search algorithm has been obtained for qutrit systems with real coefficients and the calculated results agree well with the conventional entropy based measure. The entanglement measure is further generalised for qudit (d-level) systems with real coefficients.

**21.    Limitations of some simple adiabatic quantum algorithms**  
Lawrence M. Ioannou, Michele Mosca  
International Journal of Quantum Information, Vol. 6, No. 3 (June 2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702241  
<blockquote>
<p>
Let $H(t)=(1-t/T)H_0 + (t/T)H_1$, $t\in [0,T]$, be the Hamiltonian governing an adiabatic quantum algorithm, where $H_0$ is diagonal in the Hadamard basis and $H_1$ is diagonal in the computational basis. We prove that $H_0$ and $H_1$ must each have at least two large mutually-orthogonal eigenspaces if the algorithm's running time is to be subexponential in the number of qubits. We also reproduce the optimality proof of Farhi and Gutmann's search algorithm in the context of this adiabatic scheme; because we only consider initial Hamiltonians that are diagonal in the Hadamard basis, our result is slightly stronger than the original.

**22.    Unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators**  
Anthony Chefles, Akira Kitagawa, Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki, Jason Twamley  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702245  
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the problem of unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators. The general theory of unambiguous discrimination among unitary operators is extended with this application in mind. We prove that entanglement with an ancilla cannot assist any discrimination strategy for commuting unitary operators. We also obtain a simple, practical test for the unambiguous distinguishability of an arbitrary set of unitary operators on a given system. Using this result, we prove that the unambiguous distinguishability criterion is the same for both standard and minimal oracle operators. We then show that, except in certain trivial cases, unambiguous discrimination among all standard oracle operators corresponding to integer functions with fixed domain and range is impossible. However, we find that it is possible to unambiguously discriminate among the Grover oracle operators corresponding to an arbitrarily large unsorted database. The unambiguous distinguishability of standard oracle operators corresponding to totally indistinguishable functions, which possess a strong form of classical indistinguishability, is analysed. We prove that these operators are not unambiguously distinguishable for any finite set of totally indistinguishable functions on a Boolean domain and with arbitrary fixed range. Sets of such functions on a larger domain can have unambiguously distinguishable standard oracle operators and we provide a complete analysis of the simplest case, that of four functions. We also examine the possibility of unambiguous oracle operator discrimination with multiple parallel calls and investigate an intriguing unitary superoperator transformation between standard and entanglement-assisted minimal oracle operators.

**23.    General theory for decoy-state quantum key distribution with arbitrary number of intensities**  
Masahito Hayashi  
New J. Phys. 9 284 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702251  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a general theory for quantum key distribution (QKD) in both the forward error correction and the reverse error correction cases when the QKD system is equipped with phase-randomized coherent light with arbitrary number of decoy intensities. For this purpose, generalizing Wang's expansion, we derive a convex expansion of the phase-randomized coherent state. We also numerically check that the asymptotic key generation rates are almost saturated when the number of decoy intensities is three.

**24.    Convergence of Quantum Annealing with Real-Time Schrodinger Dynamics**  
Satoshi Morita, Hidetoshi Nishimori  
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76 (2007) 064002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702252  
<blockquote>
<p>
Convergence conditions for quantum annealing are derived for optimization problems represented by the Ising model of a general form. Quantum fluctuations are introduced as a transverse field and/or transverse ferromagnetic interactions, and the time evolution follows the real-time Schrodinger equation. It is shown that the system stays arbitrarily close to the instantaneous ground state, finally reaching the target optimal state, if the strength of quantum fluctuations decreases sufficiently slowly, in particular inversely proportionally to the power of time in the asymptotic region. This is the same condition as the other implementations of quantum annealing, quantum Monte Carlo and Green's function Monte Carlo simulations, in spite of the essential difference in the type of dynamics. The method of analysis is an application of the adiabatic theorem in conjunction with an estimate of a lower bound of the energy gap based on the recently proposed idea of Somma et. al. for the analysis of classical simulated annealing using a classical-quantum correspondence.
