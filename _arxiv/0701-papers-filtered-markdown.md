**1.    Witnessing Macroscopic Entanglement in a Staggered Magnetic Field**  
Jenny Hide, Wonmin Son, Ian Lawrie, Vlatko Vedral  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 022319 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701013  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate macroscopic entanglement in an infinite XX spin-1/2 chain with staggered magnetic field, B_l=B+e^{-i\pi l}b. Using single-site entropy and by constructing an entanglement witness, we search for the existence of entanglement when the system is at absolute zero, as well as in thermal equilibrium. Although the role of the alternating magnetic field b is, in general, to suppress entanglement as do B and T, we find that when T=0, introducing b allows the existence of entanglement even when the uniform magnetic field B is arbitrarily large. We find that the region and the amount of entanglement in the spin chain can be enhanced by a staggered magnetic field.

**2.    Quantum Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes**  
Manabu Hagiwara, Hideki Imai  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701020  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, a construction of a pair of "regular" quasi-cyclic LDPC codes as ingredient codes for a quantum error-correcting code is proposed. That is, we find quantum regular LDPC codes with various weight distributions. Furthermore our proposed codes have lots of variations for length, code rate. These codes are obtained by a descrete mathematical characterization for model matrices of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. Our proposed codes achieve a bounded distance decoding (BDD) bound, or known as VG bound, and achieve a lower bound of the code length.

**4.    Localization of coherent exciton transport in phase space**  
Oliver Muelken, Veronika Bierbaum, Alexander Blumen  
Phys. Rev. E 75, 031121 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701034  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study numerically the dynamics of excitons on discrete rings in the presence of static disorder. Based on continuous-time quantum walks we compute the time evolution of the Wigner function (WF) both for pure diagonal (site) disorder, as well as for diagonal and off-diagonal (site and transfer) disorder. In both cases, large disorder leads to localization and destroys the characteristic phase space patterns of the WF found in the absence of disorder.

**5.    Communication Links for Distributed Quantum Computation**  
Rodney Van Meter, Kae Nemoto, W. J. Munro  
IEEE Transactions on Computers, 56(12), 1643--1653, Dec. 2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701043  
<blockquote>
<p>
Distributed quantum computation requires quantum operations that act over a distance on error-correction encoded states of logical qubits, such as the transfer of qubits via teleportation. We evaluate the performance of several quantum error correction codes, and find that teleportation failure rates of one percent or more are tolerable when two levels of the [[23,1,7]] code are used. We present an analysis of performing quantum error correction (QEC) on QEC-encoded states that span two quantum computers, including the creation of distributed logical zeroes. The transfer of the individual qubits of a logical state may be multiplexed in time or space, moving serially across a single link, or in parallel across multiple links. We show that the performance and reliability penalty for using serial links is small for a broad range of physical parameters, making serial links preferable for a large, distributed quantum multicomputer when engineering difficulties are considered. Such a multicomputer will be able to factor a 1,024-bit number using Shor's algorithm with a high probability of success.

**6.    Multiphoton Quantum Optics and Quantum State Engineering**  
F. Dell'Anno, S. De Siena, F. Illuminati  
Phys. Rep. 428, 53 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701050  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a review of theoretical and experimental aspects of multiphoton quantum optics. Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects of matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms; system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics, optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and atoms. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and the corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states, and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton entangled states of the electromnagnetic field, that are relevant for applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and related problems in quantum communication and information.

**7.    Quantum Walks, Quantum Gates and Quantum Computers**  
Andrew P. Hines, P.C.E. Stamp  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701088  
<blockquote>
<p>
The physics of quantum walks on graphs is formulated in Hamiltonian language, both for simple quantum walks and for composite walks, where extra discrete degrees of freedom live at each node of the graph. It is shown how to map between quantum walk Hamiltonians and Hamiltonians for qubit systems and quantum circuits; this is done for both a single- and multi-excitation coding, and for more general mappings. Specific examples of spin chains, as well as static and dynamic systems of qubits, are mapped to quantum walks, and walks on hyperlattices and hypercubes are mapped to various gate systems. We also show how to map a quantum circuit performing the quantum Fourier transform, the key element of Shor's algorithm, to a quantum walk system doing the same. The results herein are an essential preliminary to a Hamiltonian formulation of quantum walks in which coupling to a dynamic quantum environment is included.

**8.    Approximate quantum error correction, random codes, and quantum channel capacity**  
Rochus Klesse  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 062315 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701102  
<blockquote>
<p>
We work out a theory of approximate quantum error correction that allows us to derive a general lower bound for the entanglement fidelity of a quantum code. The lower bound is given in terms of Kraus operators of the quantum noise. This result is then used to analyze the average error correcting performance of codes that are randomly drawn from unitarily invariant code ensembles. Our results confirm that random codes of sufficiently large block size are highly suitable for quantum error correction. Moreover, employing a lemma of Bennett, Shor, Smolin, and Thapliyal, we prove that random coding attains information rates of the regularized coherent information.

**9.    Generalised Clifford groups and simulation of associated quantum circuits**  
Sean Clark, Richard Jozsa, Noah Linden  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701103  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computations that involve only Clifford operations are classically simulable despite the fact that they generate highly entangled states; this is the content of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Here we isolate the ingredients of the theorem and provide generalisations of some of them with the aim of identifying new classes of simulable quantum computations. In the usual construction, Clifford operations arise as projective normalisers of the first and second tensor powers of the Pauli group. We consider replacing the Pauli group by an arbitrary finite subgroup G of U(d). In particular we seek G such that G tensor G has an entangling normaliser. Via a generalisation of the Gottesman-Knill theorem the resulting normalisers lead to classes of quantum circuits that can be classically efficiently simulated. For the qubit case d=2 we exhaustively treat all finite subgroups of U(2) and find that the only ones (up to unitary equivalence and trivial phase extensions) with entangling normalisers are the groups G_n generated by X and the n^th root of Z.

**10.    Deutsch's Universal Quantum Turing Machine (Revisited)**  
Willem Fouch√©, Johannes Heidema, Glyn Jones, Petrus H. Potgieter  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701108  
<blockquote>
<p>
Deutsch, Feynman, and Manin viewed quantum computing as a kind of universal physical simulation procedure. Much of the writing about quantum Turing machines has shown how these machines can simulate an arbitrary unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. This interesting problem has been addressed most famously in a paper by Deutsch, and later by Bernstein and Vazirani. Quantum Turing machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines and one might hope to find a universal machine in this class. A universal machine is the basis of a notion of programmability. The extent to which universality has in fact been established by the pioneers in the field is examined and a key notion in theoretical computer science (universality) is scrutinised. In a forthcoming paper, the authors will also consider universality in the quantum gate model.

**11.    Evidence for coherent collective Rydberg excitation in the strong blockade regime**  
Rolf Heidemann, Ulrich Raitzsch, Vera Bendkowsky, Bj?rn Butscher, Robert L?w, Luis Santos, Tilman Pfau  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 163601 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701120  
<blockquote>
<p>
Blockade effects on the single quantum level are at the heart of quantum devices like single-electron transistors. The blockade mechanisms are based on strong interactions like the Coulomb interaction in case of single electrons. Neutral atoms excited into a Rydberg state experience abnormally strong interactions that lead to the corresponding blockade effect for Rydberg atoms. In this paper we report on our measurements of a strong van der Waals blockade, showing that only one out of several thousand atoms within a blockade volume can be excited. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate the coherent nature of the excitation of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms into a Rydberg state, confirming the predicted dependence of the collective Rabi frequency on the square root of the mesoscopic system size. This collective coherent behaviour is generic for all mesoscopic systems which are able to carry only one single excitation quantum.

**12.    Visualization of Coherent Destruction of Tunneling in an Optical Double Well System**  
G. Della Valle, M. Ornigotti, E. Cianci, V. Foglietti, P. Laporta, S. Longhi  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 263601 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701121  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a direct visualization of coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) of light waves in a double well system which provides an optical analog of quantum CDT as originally proposed by Grossmann, Dittrich, Jung, and Hanggi [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 67}, 516 (1991)]. The driven double well, realized by two periodically-curved waveguides in an Er:Yb-doped glass, is designed so that spatial light propagation exactly mimics the coherent space-time dynamics of matter waves in a driven double-well potential governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The fluorescence of Er ions is exploited to image the spatial evolution of light in the two wells, clearly demonstrating suppression of light tunneling for special ratios between frequency and amplitude of the driving field.

**13.    Quantum t-designs: t-wise independence in the quantum world**  
Andris Ambainis, Joseph Emerson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701126  
<blockquote>
<p>
A t-design for quantum states is a finite set of quantum states with the property of simulating the Haar-measure on quantum states, w.r.t. any test that uses at most t copies of a state. We give efficient constructions for approximate quantum t-designs for arbitrary t. We then show that an approximate 4-design provides a derandomization of the state-distinction problem considered by Sen (quant-ph/0512085), which is relevant to solving certain instances of the hidden subgroup problem.

**14.    Trapping of light pulses in ensembles of stationary Lambda atoms**  
Kristian Rymann Hansen, Klaus Molmer  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701133  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed theoretical description of the generation of stationary light pulses by standing wave electromagnetically induced transparency in media comprised of stationary atoms. We show that, contrary to thermal gas media, the achievable storage times are limited only by the ground state dephasing rate of the atoms, making such media ideally suited for nonlinear optical interactions between stored pulses. Furthermore, we find significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the two types of media, which are important for quantum information processing schemes involving stationary light pulses.

**15.    Scattering quantum random-walk search with errors**  
A. Gabris, T. Kiss, I. Jex  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 062315 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701150  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the realization of a quantum-walk search algorithm in a passive, linear optical network. The specific model enables us to consider the effect of realistic sources of noise and losses on the search efficiency. Photon loss uniform in all directions is shown to lead to the rescaling of search time. Deviation from directional uniformity leads to the enhancement of the search efficiency compared to uniform loss with the same average. In certain cases even increasing loss in some of the directions can improve search efficiency. We show that while we approach the classical limit of the general search algorithm by introducing random phase fluctuations, its utility for searching is lost. Using numerical methods, we found that for static phase errors the averaged search efficiency displays a damped oscillatory behaviour that asymptotically tends to a non-zero value.

**16.    Using quantum key distribution for cryptographic purposes: a survey**

Theoretical Computer Science, 560 (2014), pp. 62-81  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701168  
<blockquote>
<p>
The appealing feature of quantum key distribution (QKD), from a cryptographic viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, QKD however does not provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established by QKD are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating QKD in security infrastructures, to analyze how QKD can be combined with other cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment techniques, QKD being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic scenarios related to the practical use of QKD in cryptographic infrastructures: 1) using QKD as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a point-to-point link; 2) using QKD in a network containing many users with the objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the constraints as well as the potential interest of using QKD in these contexts. We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of QKD technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research.

**17.    Strongly Correlated Two-Photon Transport in One-Dimensional Waveguide Coupled to A Two-Level System**  
Jung-Tsung Shen, Shanhui Fan  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 153003 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701170  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that two-photon transport is strongly correlated in one-dimensional waveguide coupled to a two-level system. The exact S-matrix is constructed using a generalized Bethe-Ansatz technique. We show that the scattering eigenstates of this system include a two-photon bound state that passes through the two-level system as a composite single particle. Also, the two-level system can induce effective attractive or repulsive interactions in space for photons. This general procedure can be applied to the Anderson model as well.

**18.    Quantum walks on quotient graphs**  
Hari Krovi, Todd A. Brun  
Physical Review A 75, 062332 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701173  
<blockquote>
<p>
A discrete-time quantum walk on a graph is the repeated application of a unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph. If this unitary evolution operator has an associated group of symmetries, then for certain initial states the walk will be confined to a subspace of the original Hilbert space. Symmetries of the original graph, given by its automorphism group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. We show that a quantum walk confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group can be seen as a different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph. We give an explicit construction of the quotient graph for any subgroup of the automorphism group and illustrate it with examples. The automorphisms of the quotient graph which are inherited from the original graph are the original automorphism group modulo the subgroup used to construct it. We then analyze the behavior of hitting times on quotient graphs. Hitting time is the average time it takes a walk to reach a given final vertex from a given initial vertex. It has been shown in earlier work [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 042334 (2006)] that the hitting time can be infinite. We give a condition which determines whether the quotient graph has infinite hitting times given that they exist in the original graph. We apply this condition for the examples discussed and determine which quotient graphs have infinite hitting times. All known examples of quantum walks with fast hitting times correspond to systems with quotient graphs much smaller than the original graph; we conjecture that the existence of a small quotient graph with finite hitting times is necessary for a walk to exhibit a quantum speed-up.

**19.    Asymptotically noise decoupling for Markovian open quantum systems**  
Jing Zhang, Re-Bing Wu, Chun-Wen Li, Tzyh-Jong Tarn, Jian-Wu Wu  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 022324 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701175  
<blockquote>
<p>
The noise decoupling problem is investigated for general N-level Markovian open quantum systems. Firstly, the concept of Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra $su(N)$ is introduced as a tool of designing control Hamiltonians. Next, under certain assumptions, it is shown that a part of variables of the coherence vector of the system density matrix can be asymptotically decoupled from the environmental noises. The resulting noise decoupling scheme is applied to one-qubit, qutrit and two-qubit quantum systems, by which the coherence evolution of the one-qubit and qutrit systems can always be asymptotically preserved, while, for two-qubit systems, our findings indicate that evolution of some variables can be preserved only for some initial states.

**20.    Factorization of Quantum Density Matrices According to Bayesian and Markov Networks**  
Robert R. Tucci  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701201  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that any quantum density matrix can be represented by a Bayesian network (a directed acyclic graph), and also by a Markov network (an undirected graph). We show that any Bayesian or Markov net that represents a density matrix, is logically equivalent to a set of conditional independencies (symmetries) satisfied by the density matrix. We show that the d-separation theorems of classical Bayesian and Markov networks generalize in a simple and natural way to quantum physics. The quantum d-separation theorems are shown to be closely connected to quantum entanglement. We show that the graphical rules for d-separation can be used to detect pairs of nodes (or of node sets) in a graph that are unentangled. CMI entanglement (a.k.a. squashed entanglement), a measure of entanglement originally discovered by analyzing Bayesian networks, is an important part of the theory of this paper.

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701210  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a framework for efficiently performing Monte Carlo wave-function simulations in cavity QED with moving particles. It relies heavily on the object-oriented programming paradigm as realised in C++, and is extensible and applicable for simulating open interacting quantum dynamics in general. The user is provided with a number of ``elements'', eg pumped moving particles, pumped lossy cavity modes, and various interactions to compose complex interacting systems, which contain several particles moving in electromagnetic fields of various configurations, and perform wave-function simulations on such systems. A number of tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new elements.

**22.    Scattering of polarized laser light by an atomic gas in free space: a QSDE approach**  
Luc Bouten, John K. Stockton, Gopal Sarma, Hideo Mabuchi  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 052111 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701224  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a model, based on a quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE), to describe the scattering of polarized laser light by an atomic gas. The gauge terms in the QSDE account for the direct scattering of the laser light into different field channels. Once the model has been set, we can rigorously derive quantum filtering equations for balanced polarimetry and homodyne detection experiments, study the statistics of output processes and investigate a strong driving, weak coupling limit.

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701235  
<blockquote>
<p>
Extraspecial groups form a remarkable subclass of p-groups. They are also present in quantum information theory, in particular in quantum error correction. We give here a polynomial time quantum algorithm for finding hidden subgroups in extraspecial groups. Our approach is quite different from the recent algorithms presented in [17] and [2] for the Heisenberg group, the extraspecial p-group of size p3 and exponent p. Exploiting certain nice automorphisms of the extraspecial groups we define specific group actions which are used to reduce the problem to hidden subgroup instances in abelian groups that can be dealt with directly.

<p>
We describe a qubit encoded in continuous quantum variables of an rf superconducting quantum interference device. Since the number of accessible states in the system is infinite, we may protect its two-dimensional subspace from small errors introduced by the interaction with the environment and during manipulations. We show how to prepare the fault-tolerant state and manipulate the system. The discussed operations suffice to perform quantum computation on the encoded state, syndrome extraction, and quantum error correction. We also comment on the physical sources of errors and possible imperfections while manipulating the system.

Duadic group algebra codes are a generalization of quadratic residue codes. This paper settles an open problem raised by Zhu concerning the existence of duadic group algebra codes.

**26.    Proposal for detection of non-Markovian decay via current noise**  
Yueh-Nan Chen, Guang-Yin Chen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0701541  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to detect non-Markovian decay of an exciton qubit coupled to multi-mode bosonic reservoir via shot-noise measurements. Non-equilibrium current noise is calculated for a quantum dot embedded inside a \QTR{it}{p-i-n} junction. An additional term from non-Markovian effect is obtained in the derivation of noise spectrum. As examples, two practical photonic reservoirs, photon vacuum with the inclusion of cut-off frequency and surface plasmons, are given to show that the noise may become super-Poissonian due to this non-Markovian effect. Utilizing the property of super-radiance is further suggested to enhance the noise value.
