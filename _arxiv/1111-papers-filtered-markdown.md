**1.    On exact quantum query complexity**  
Ashley Montanaro, Richard Jozsa, Graeme Mitchison  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0475  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present several families of total boolean functions which have exact quantum query complexity which is a constant multiple (between 1/2 and 2/3) of their classical query complexity, and show that optimal quantum algorithms for these functions cannot be obtained by simply computing parities of pairs of bits. We also characterise the model of nonadaptive exact quantum query complexity in terms of coding theory and completely characterise the query complexity of symmetric boolean functions in this context. These results were originally inspired by numerically solving the semidefinite programs characterising quantum query complexity for small problem sizes. We include numerical results giving the optimal success probabilities achievable by quantum algorithms computing all boolean functions on up to 4 bits, and all symmetric boolean functions on up to 6 bits.

**2.    Quantum Diffusion-Limited Aggregation**  
David B. Johnson, Gonzalo Ordó?ez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0626  
<blockquote>
<p>
Though classical random walks have been studied for many years, research concerning their quantum analogues, quantum random walks, has only come about recently. Numerous simulations of both types of walks have been run and analyzed, and are generally well-understood. Research pertaining to one of the more important properties of classical random walks, namely, their ability to build fractal structures in diffusion-limited aggregation, has been particularly noteworthy. However, only now has research begun in this area in regards to quantum random motion. The study of random walks and the structures they build has various applications in materials science. Since all processes are quantum in nature, it is important to consider the quantum variant of diffusion-limited aggregation. Recognizing that Schr\"odinger equation and a classical random walk are both diffusion equations, it is possible to connect and compare them. Using similar parameters for both equations, we ran various simulations aggregating particles. Our results show that particles moving according to Schr\"odinger equation can create fractal structures, much like the classical random walk. Furthermore, the fractal dimensions of these quantum diffusion-limited aggregates vary between 1.43 and 2, depending on the size of the initial wave packet.

**3.    Conditional detection of pure quantum states of light after storage in a waveguide**  
Erhan Saglamyurek, Neil Sinclair, Jeongwan Jin, Joshua A. Slater, Daniel Oblak, Félix Bussières, Mathew George, Raimund Ricken, Wolfgang Sohler, Wolfgang Tittel  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 083602 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0676  
<blockquote>
<p>
Conditional detection is an important tool to extract weak signals from a noisy background and is closely linked to heralding, which is an essential component of protocols for long distance quantum communication and distributed quantum information processing in quantum networks. Here we demonstrate the conditional detection of time-bin qubits after storage in and retrieval from a photon-echo based waveguide quantum memory. Each qubit is encoded into one member of a photon-pair produced via spontaneous parametric down conversion, and the conditioning is achieved by the detection of the other member of the pair. Performing projection measurements with the stored and retrieved photons onto different bases we obtain an average storage fidelity of 0.885 \pm 0.020, which exceeds the relevant classical bounds and shows the suitability of our integrated light-matter interface for future applications of quantum information processing.

**4.    Zero forcing, linear and quantum controllability for systems evolving on networks**  
Daniel Burgarth, Domenico D'Alessandro, Leslie Hogben, Simone Severini, Michael Young  
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 58, 2349 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1475  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of systems on networks from a linear algebraic perspective. The control theoretic concept of controllability describes the set of states that can be reached for these systems. Under appropriate conditions, there is a connection between the quantum (Lie theoretic) property of controllability and the linear systems (Kalman) controllability condition. We investigate how the graph theoretic concept of a zero forcing set impacts the controllability property. In particular, we prove that if a set of vertices is a zero forcing set, the associated dynamical system is controllable. The results open up the possibility of further exploiting the analogy between networks, linear control systems theory, and quantum systems Lie algebraic theory. This study is motivated by several quantum systems currently under study, including continuous quantum walks modeling transport phenomena. Additionally, it proposes zero forcing as a new notion in the analysis of complex networks.

**5.    Guaranteed violation of a Bell inequality without aligned reference frames or calibrated devices**  
Peter Shadbolt, Tamas Vertesi, Yeong-Cherng Liang, Cyril Branciard, Nicolas Brunner, Jeremy L. O'Brien  
Scientific Reports 2, 470 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1853  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bell tests---the experimental demonstration of a Bell inequality violation---are central to understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics, underpin quantum technologies, and are a powerful diagnostic tool for technological developments in these areas. To date, Bell tests have relied on careful calibration of the measurement devices and alignment of a shared reference frame between the two parties---both technically demanding tasks in general. Surprisingly, we show that neither of these operations are necessary, violating Bell inequalities with near certainty with (i) unaligned, but calibrated, measurement devices, and (ii) uncalibrated and unaligned devices. We demonstrate generic quantum nonlocality with randomly chosen local measurements on a singlet state of two photons implemented with reconfigurable integrated optical waveguide circuits based on voltage-controlled phase shifters. The observed results demonstrate the robustness of our schemes to imperfections and statistical noise. This new approach is likely to have important applications in both fundamental science and in quantum technologies, including device independent quantum key distribution.

**6.    Rank Restriction for the Variational Calculation of Two-electron Reduced Density Matrices of Many-electron Atoms and Molecules**  
Kasra Naftchi-Ardebili, Nathania W. Hau, David A. Mazziotti  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 052506 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1978  
<blockquote>
<p>
Variational minimization of the ground-state energy as a function of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM), constrained by necessary $N$-representability conditions, provides a polynomial-scaling approach to studying strongly correlated molecules without computing the many-electron wavefunction. Here we introduce a new route to enhancing necessary conditions for $N$-representability through rank restriction of the 2-RDM. Rather than adding computationally more expensive $N$-representability conditions, we directly enhance the accuracy of two-particle (2-positivity) conditions through rank restriction, which removes degrees of freedom in the 2-RDM that are not sufficiently constrained. We select the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM by deriving the ranks associated with model wavefunctions including both mean-field and antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wave functions. Because the 2-positivity conditions are exact for quantum systems with AGP ground states, the rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM from the AGP ansatz provides a minimum for its value in variational 2-RDM calculations of general quantum systems. To implement the rank-restricted conditions, we extend a first-order algorithm for large-scale semidefinite programming. The rank-restricted conditions significantly improve the accuracy of the energies; for example, the percentages of correlation energies recovered for HF, CO, and N$_{2}$ improve from 115.2%, 121.7%, and 121.5% without rank restriction to 97.8%, 101.1%, and 100.0% with rank restriction. Similar results are found at both equilibrium and non-equilibrium geometries. While more accurate, the rank-restricted $N$-representability conditions are less expensive computationally than the full-rank conditions.

**7.    Concurrence in Disordered Systems**  
Jenny Hide  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45 115302 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2063  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum systems exist at finite temperatures and are likely to be disordered to some level. Since applications of quantum information often rely on entanglement, we require methods which allow entanglement measures to be calculated in the presence of disorder at non-zero temperatures. We demonstrate how the disorder averaged concurrence can be calculated using thermal many-body perturbation theory. Our technique can also be applied to other entanglement measures. To illustrate, we find the disorder averaged concurrence of an XX spin chain. We find that concurrence can be increased by disorder in some parameter regimes.

**8.    A Cutoff Phenomenon for Quantum Markov Chains**  
Michael J. Kastoryano, David Reeb, Michael M. Wolf  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45 (2012) 075307  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2123  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive upper and lower bounds on the convergence behavior of certain classes of one-parameter quantum dynamical semigroups. The classes we consider consist of tensor product channels and of channels with commuting Liouvillians. We introduce the notion of Cutoff Phenomenon in the setting of quantum information theory, and show how it exemplifies the fact that the convergence of (quantum) stochastic processes is not solely governed by the spectral gap of the transition map. We apply the new methods to show that graph states can be prepared efficiently, albeit not in constant time, by dissipation, and give the exact scaling behavior of the time to stationarity.

**9.    From Maximal Entropy Random Walk to quantum thermodynamics**  
Jarek Duda  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2253  
<blockquote>
<p>
Surprisingly the looking natural random walk leading to Brownian motion occurs to be often biased in a very subtle way: usually refers to only approximate fulfillment of thermodynamical principles like maximizing uncertainty. Recently, a new philosophy of stochastic modeling was introduced, which by being mathematically similar to euclidean path integrals, finally fulfills these principles exactly. Their local behavior is usually similar, but may lead to completely different global properties. In contrast to Brownian motion leading to nearly uniform stationary density, this recent approach turns out in agreement with having strong localization properties thermodynamical predictions of quantum mechanics, like thermalizing to dynamical equilibrium state having probability density as the quantum ground state: squares of coordinates of the lowest energy eigenvector of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for single particle in discrete case, or of the standard Schrodinger operator while including potential and making infinitesimal limit. It also provides a natural intuition of the amplitudes' squares relating to probabilities. The present paper gathers, formalizes and extends these results. There are also introduced and discussed some new generalizations, like considering multiple particles with thermodynamical analogue of Pauli exclusion principle or time dependent cases, which allowed to introduce thermodynamical analogues of momentum operator, Ehrenfest equation and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

**10.    Quantum correlations dynamics under different non-markovian environmental models**  
Ying-Jie Zhang, Wei Han, Chuan-Jia Shan, Yun-Jie Xia  
J. Opt. Soc. Am. B, 29, 2060, 2012  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2423  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the roles of different environmental models on quantum correlation dynamics of two-qubit composite system interacting with two independent environments. The most common environmental models (the single-Lorentzian model, the squared-Lorentzian model, the two-Lorentzian model and band-gap model) are analyzed. First, we note that for the weak coupling regime, the monotonous decay speed of the quantum correlation is mainly determined by the spectral density functions of these different environments. Then, by considering the strong coupling regime we find that, contrary to what is stated in the weak coupling regime, the dynamics of quantum correlation depends on the non-Markovianity of the environmental models, and is independent of the environmental spectrum density functions.

**11.    Error tolerance of the BosonSampling model for linear optics quantum computing**  
Peter P. Rohde, Timothy C. Ralph  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 022332 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2426  
<blockquote>
<p>
Linear optics quantum computing (LOQC) is a promising approach to implementing scalable quantum computation (QC). However, this approach has very demanding physical resource requirements. Recently, Aaronson & Arkhipov showed that a simplified model, which avoids the requirement for fast feed-forward and post-selection, while likely not capable of solving BQP-complete problems efficiently, can solve an interesting sampling problem, believed to be classically hard. Loss and mode-mismatch are the dominant sources of error in such systems. We provide evidence that even lossy systems, or systems with mode-mismatch, are likely to be classically hard to simulate. This is of practical interest to experimentalists wishing to demonstrate such systems, since it suggests that even with errors in their implementation, they are likely implementing an algorithm which is classically hard to simulate. Our results also equivalently apply to the multi-walker quantum walk model.

<p>
Following the simple observation that the interconnection of a set of quantum optical input-output devices can be specified using structural mode VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL), we demonstrate a computer-aided schematic capture workflow for modeling and simulating multi-component photonic circuits. We describe an algorithm for parsing circuit descriptions to derive quantum equations of motion, illustrate our approach using simple examples based on linear and cavity-nonlinear optical components, and demonstrate a computational approach to hierarchical model reduction.

**13.    Increasing efficiency of a linear-optical quantum gate using an electronic feed forward**  
Martina Mikova, Helena Fikerova, Ivo Straka, Michal Micuda, Miroslav Jezek, Miloslav Dusek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3237  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have successfully used a fast electronic feed forward to increase the success probability of a linear optical implementation of a programmable phase gate from 25% to its theoretical limit of 50%. The feed forward applies a conditional unitary operation which changes the incorrect output states of the data qubit to the correct ones. The gate itself rotates an arbitrary quantum state of the data qubit around the z-axis of the Bloch sphere with the angle of rotation being fully determined by the state of the program qubit. The gate implementation is based on fiber optics components. Qubits are encoded into spatial modes of single photons. The signal from the feed-forward detector is led directly to a phase modulator using only a passive voltage divider. We have verified the increase of the success probability and characterized the gate operation by means of quantum process tomography. We have demonstrated that the use of the feed forward does not affect either the process fidelity or the output-state fidelities.

**14.    Jaynes Cummings Photonic Superlattices**  
Stefano Longhi  
Opt. Lett. 32, 3407 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3457  
<blockquote>
<p>
A classical realization of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, describing the interaction of a two-level atom with a quantized cavity mode, is proposed based on light transport in engineered waveguide superlattices. The optical setting enables to visualize in Fock space dynamical regimes not yet accessible in quantum systems, providing new physical insights into the deep strong coupling regime of the JC model. In particular, bouncing of photon number wave packets in Hilbert space and revivals of populations are explained as generalized Bloch oscillations in an inhomogeneous tight-binding lattice.

**16.    Interplay between computable measures of entanglement and other quantum correlations**  
Davide Girolami, Gerardo Adesso  
Phys. Rev. A A 84, 052110 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3643  
<blockquote>
<p>
Composite quantum systems can be in generic states characterized not only by entanglement, but also by more general quantum correlations. The interplay between these two signatures of nonclassicality is still not completely understood. In this work we investigate this issue focusing on computable and observable measures of such correlations: entanglement is quantified by the negativity N, while general quantum correlations are measured by the (normalized) geometric quantum discord D_G. For two-qubit systems, we find that the geometric discord reduces to the squared negativity on pure states, while the relationship $D_G \geq N^2$ holds for arbitrary mixed states. The latter result is rigorously extended to pure, Werner and isotropic states of two-qudit systems for arbitrary d, and numerical evidence of its validity for arbitrary states of a qubit and a qutrit is provided as well. Our results establish an interesting hierarchy, that we conjecture to be universal, between two relevant and experimentally friendly nonclassicality indicators. This ties in with the intuition that general quantum correlations should at least contain and in general exceed entanglement on mixed states of composite quantum systems.

**17.    Characteristics of Correlated Photon Pairs Generated in Ultra-compact Silicon Slow-light Photonic Crystal Waveguides**  
Chunle Xiong, Christelle Monat, Matthew J. Collins, Alex S. Clark, Christian Grillet, Graham D. Marshall, M. J. Steel, Juntao Li, Liam O'Faolain, Thomas F. Krauss, Benjamin J. Eggleton

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3709  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the characterization of correlated photon pairs generated in dispersion-engineered silicon slow-light photonic crystal waveguides pumped by picosecond pulses. We found that taking advantage of the 15 nm flat-band slow-light window (vg ~ c/30) the bandwidth for correlated photon-pair generation in 96 and 196 \mum long waveguides was at least 11.2 nm; while a 396 \mum long waveguide reduced the bandwidth to 8 nm (only half of the slow-light bandwidth due to the increased impact of phase matching in a longer waveguide). The key metrics for a photon-pair source: coincidence to accidental ratio (CAR) and pair brightness were measured to be a maximum 33 at a pair generation rate of 0.004 pair per pulse in a 196 \mum long waveguide. Within the measurement errors the maximum CAR achieved in 96, 196 and 396 \mum long waveguides is constant. The noise analysis shows that detector dark counts, leaked pump light, linear and nonlinear losses, multiple pair generation and detector jitter are the limiting factors to the CAR performance of the sources.

**18.    Non-Markovianity: initial correlations and nonlinear optical measurements**  
Arend G. Dijkstra, Yoshitaka Tanimura  
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 370, 3658 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3722  
<blockquote>
<p>
By extending the response function approach developed in nonlinear optics, we analytically derive an expression for the non-Markovianity [Laine, et al, Phys. Rev. A 81, 062115 (2010)] in the time evolution of a system in contact with a quantum mechanical bath, and find a close connection with the directly observable nonlinear optical response. The result indicates that memory in the bath induced fluctuations rather than in the dissipation causes non-Markovianity. Initial correlations between states of the system and the bath are shown to be essential for a correct understanding of the non-Markovianity.

**19.    On the Use of Shor States for the [7,1,3] Quantum Error Correcting Code**  
Yaakov S. Weinstein, Sidney D. Buchbinder  
PRA 86, 052336 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3930  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the effect of Shor state construction methods on logical state encoding and quantum error correction for the [[7,1,3]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum error correction code in a nonequiprobable error environment. We determine the optimum number of verification steps to be used in Shor state construction and whether Shor states without verification are usable for practical quantum computation. These results are compared to the same processes of encoding and error correction where Shor states are not used. We demonstrate that the construction of logical zero states with no first order error terms may not require the complete edifice of quantum fault tolerance. With respect to error correction, we show for a particular initial state that error correction using a single qubit for syndrome measurement yields a similar output state accuracy to error correction using Shor states as syndrome qubits. In addition, we demonstrate that error correction with Shor states has an inherent sensitivity to bit-flip errors. Finally, we suggest that in this type of error correction scenario one should always repeat a syndrome measurement until attaining an all zero readout (twice in row).

**20.    Nonlinear photon transport in a semiconductor waveguide-cavity system containing a single quantum dot: Anharmonic cavity-QED regime**  
S. Hughes, C. Roy  
Phys. Rev. B 85, 035315 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3995  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a semiconductor master equation technique to study the input/output characteristics of coherent photon transport in a semiconductor waveguide-cavity system containing a single quantum dot. We use this approach to investigate the effects of photon propagation and anharmonic cavity-QED for various dot-cavity interaction strengths, including weakly-coupled, intermediately-coupled, and strongly-coupled regimes. We demonstrate that for mean photon numbers much less than 0.1, the commonly adopted weak excitation (single quantum) approximation breaks down, even in the weak coupling regime. As a measure of the anharmonic multiphoton-correlations, we compute the Fano factor and the correlation error associated with making a semiclassical approximation. We also explore the role of electron--acoustic-phonon scattering and find that phonon-mediated scattering plays a qualitatively important role on the light propagation characteristics. As an application of the theory, we simulate a conditional phase gate at a phonon bath temperature of $20 $K in the strong coupling regime.

**21.    Surface code quantum computing by lattice surgery**  
Clare Horsman, Austin G. Fowler, Simon Devitt, Rodney Van Meter  
2012 New J. Phys. 14 123011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4022  
<blockquote>
<p>
In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.

**22.    Quasi-locality and efficient simulation of Markovian quantum dynamics**  
Thomas Barthel, Martin Kliesch  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 230504 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4210  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider open many-body systems governed by a time-dependent quantum master equation with short-range interactions. With a generalized Lieb-Robinson bound, we show that the evolution in this very generic framework is quasi-local, i.e., the evolution of observables can be approximated by implementing the dynamics only in a vicinity of the observables' support. The precision increases exponentially with the diameter of the considered subsystem. Hence, the time-evolution can be simulated on classical computers with a cost that is independent of the system size. Providing error bounds for Trotter decompositions, we conclude that the simulation on a quantum computer is additionally efficient in time. For experiments and simulations, our result can be used to rigorously bound finite-size effects.

<p>
We analyze continuous-time quantum walks on necklace graphs - cyclical graphs consisting of many copies of a smaller graph (pearl).

We then present a general approach for showing that the mixing time scales (with growing size of the necklace) similarly to that of a simple walk on a cycle. Finally, we present results for mixing on several necklace graphs.

<p>
We consider the effects of plane-wave states scattering off finite graphs, as an approach to implementing single-qubit unitary operations within the continuous-time quantum walk framework of universal quantum computation. Four semi-infinite tails are attached at arbitrary points of a given graph, representing the input and output registers of a single qubit. For a range of momentum eigenstates, we enumerate all of the graphs with up to $n=9$ vertices for which the scattering implements a single-qubit gate. As $n$ increases, the number of new unitary operations increases exponentially, and for $n>6$ the majority correspond to rotations about axes distributed roughly uniformly across the Bloch sphere. Rotations by both rational and irrational multiples of $\pi$ are found.

Phys. Rev. A 85, 032313 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5185  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum repeater scheme based on the recently proposed qubit amplifier [N. Gisin, S. Pironio and N. Sangouard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 070501 (2010)]. It relies on a on-demand entangled-photon pair source which uses on-demand single-photon sources, linear optical elements and atomic ensembles. Interestingly, the imperfections affecting the states created from this source, caused e.g. by detectors with non-unit efficiencies, are systematically purified from an entanglement swapping operation based on a two-photon detection. This allows the distribution of entanglement over very long distances with a high fidelity, i.e. without vacuum components and multiphoton errors. Therefore, the resulting quantum repeater architecture does not necessitate final postselections and thus achieves high entanglement distribution rates. This also provides unique opportunities for device-independent quantum key distribution over long distances with linear optics and atomic ensembles.

Finally, we derive convergence theorems for these residual spectral densities.

<p>
Diamond is a unique material with exceptional physical and chemical properties that offers potential for the realization of high-performance devices with novel functionalities. For example diamond's high refractive index, transparency over wide wavelength range, and large Raman gain are of interest for the implementation of novel photonic devices. Recently, atom-like impurities in diamond emerged as an exceptional system for quantum information processing, quantum sensing and quantum networks. For these and other applications, it is essential to develop an integrated nanophotonic platform based on diamond. Here, we report on the realization of such an integrated diamond photonic platform, diamond on insulator (DOI), consisting of a thin single crystal diamond film on top of an insulating silicon dioxide/silicon substrate. Using this approach, we demonstrate diamond ring resonators that operate in a wide wavelength range, including the visible (630nm) and near-infrared (1,550nm). Finally, we demonstrate an integrated, on-chip quantum nanophotonic network, consisting of ring resonators coupled to low loss waveguides with grating couplers, that enables the generation and efficient routing of single photons at room temperature.

**29.    Decoherence suppression of open quantum systems through a strong coupling to non-Markovian reservoirs**  
Chan U. Lei, Wei-Min Zhang  
Phys. Rev. A84, 052116 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5433  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we provide a mechanism of decoherence suppression for open quantum systems in general, and that for "Schrodinger cat-like" state in particular, through the strong couplings to non-Markovian reservoirs. Different from the usual strategies of suppressing decoherence by decoupling the system from the environment in the literatures, here the decoherence suppression employs the strong back-reaction from non-Markovian reservoirs. The mechanism relies on the existence of the singularities (bound states) of the nonequilibrium retarded Green function which completely determines the dissipation and decoherence dynamics of open systems. As an application, we examine the decoherence dynamics of a photonic crystal nanocavity that is coupled to a waveguide. The strong non-Markovian suppression of decoherence for the optical cat state is attained.

<blockquote>
<p>
A five-qubit codeword stabilized quantum code is implemented in a seven-qubit system using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our experiment implements a good nonadditive quantum code which encodes a larger Hilbert space than any stabilizer code with the same length and capable of correcting the same kind of errors. The experimentally measured quantum coherence is shown to be robust against artificially introduced errors, benchmarking the success in implementing the quantum error correction code. Given the typical decoherence time of the system, our experiment illustrates the ability of coherent control to implement complex quantum circuits for demonstrating interesting results in spin qubits for quantum computing.

Laser Phys. Lett. 10, 045202 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5683  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report a versatile and practical approach for generating high-quality polarization entanglement in a fully guided-wave fashion. Our setup relies on a high-brilliance type-0 waveguide generator producing paired photon at a telecom wavelength associated with an advanced energy-time to polarisation transcriber. The latter is capable of creating any pure polarization entangled state, and allows manipulating single photon bandwidths that can be chosen at will over five orders of magnitude, ranging from tens of MHz to several THz. We achieve excellent entanglement fidelities for particular spectral bandwidths, i.e. 25 MHz, 540 MHz and 100 GHz, proving the relevance of our approach. Our scheme stands as an ideal candidate for a wide range of network applications, ranging from dense division multiplexing quantum key distribution to heralded optical quantum memories and repeaters.

**32.    Reveal non-Markovianity of open quantum systems via local operations**  
Huan Yang, Haixing Miao, Yanbei Chen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6079  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovianity, as an important feature of general open quantum systems, is usually difficult to quantify with limited knowledge of how the plant that we are interested in interacts with its environment-the bath. It often happens that the reduced dynamics of the plant attached to a non-Markovian bath becomes indistinguishable from the one with a Markovian bath, if we left the entire system freely evolve. Here we show that non-Markovianity can be revealed via applying local unitary operations on the plant-they will influence the plant evolution at later times due to memory of the bath. This not only provides a new criterion for non-Markovianity, but also sheds light on protecting and recovering quantum coherence in non-Markovian systems, which will be useful for quantum-information processing.

**33.    Experimental Activation of Bound Entanglement**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6170  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement is one of the essential resources in quantum information and communication technology (QICT). The entanglement thus far explored and applied to QICT has been pure and distillable entanglement. Yet there is another type of entanglement, called 'bound entanglement', which is not distillable by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate the experimental 'activation' of the bound entanglement held in the four-qubit Smolin state, unleashing its immanent entanglement in distillable form, with the help of auxiliary two-qubit entanglement and LOCC. We anticipate that it opens the way to a new class of QICT applications that utilize more general classes of entanglement than ever, including bound entanglement.

**36.    Quantum measurements in continuous time, non Markovian evolutions and feedback**  
Alberto Barchielli, Matteo Gregoratti  
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2012) vol. 370, no. 1979, 5364-5385  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6840  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we reconsider a version of quantum trajectory theory based on the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with stochastic coefficients, which was mathematically introduced in the '90s, and we develop it in order to describe the non Markovian evolution of a quantum system continuously measured and controlled thanks to a measurement based feedback. Indeed, realistic descriptions of a feedback loop have to include delay and thus need a non Markovian theory. The theory allows to put together non Markovian evolutions and measurements in continuous time in agreement with the modern axiomatic formulation of quantum mechanics. To illustrate the possibilities of such a theory, we apply it to a two-level atom stimulated by a laser. We introduce closed loop control too, via the stimulating laser, with the aim to enhance the "squeezing" of the emitted light, or other typical quantum properties. Note that here we change the point of view with respect to the usual applications of control theory. In our model the "system" is the two-level atom, but we do not want to control its state, to bring the atom to a final target state. Our aim is to control the "Mandel $Q$-parameter" and the spectrum of the emitted light; in particular the spectrum is not a property at a single time, but involves a long interval of times (a Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the observed output is needed).

**37.    Enhancing the spreading of quantum walks on star graphs by additional bonds**  
Anastasiia Anishchenko, Alexander Blumen, Oliver Muelken  
Quantum Information Processing 11, 1273 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7065  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) on networks with highly degenerate eigenvalue spectra of the corresponding connectivity matrices. In particular, we consider the two cases of a star graph and of a complete graph, both having one highly degenerate eigenvalue, while displaying different topologies. While the CTQW spreading over the network - in terms of the average probability to return or to stay at an initially excited node - is in both cases very slow, also when compared to the corresponding classical continuous-time random walk (CTRW), we show how the spreading is enhanced by randomly adding bonds to the star graph or removing bonds from the complete graph. Then, the spreading of the excitations may become very fast, even outperforming the corresponding CTRW. Our numerical results suggest that the maximal spreading is reached halfway between the star graph and the complete graph. We further show how this disorder-enhanced spreading is related to the networks' eigenvalues.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0509  
<blockquote>
<p>
The superconducting critical temperature, TC, of thin Nb films is significantly modified when gold nanoparticles (NPs) are chemically linked to the Nb film, with a consistent enhancement when using 3 nm long disilane linker molecules. The TC increases by up to 10% for certain linker length and NPs size. No change is observed when the nanoparticles are physisorbed with non-linking molecules. Electron tunneling spectra acquired on the linked NPs below TC typically exhibit zero-bias peaks. We attribute these results to a pairing mechanism coupling electrons in the Nb and the NPs, mediated by the organic linkers.

<blockquote>
<p>
We solve a 20-year old problem posed by Yannakakis and prove that there exists no polynomial-size linear program (LP) whose associated polytope projects to the traveling salesman polytope, even if the LP is not required to be symmetric. Moreover, we prove that this holds also for the cut polytope and the stable set polytope. These results were discovered through a new connection that we make between one-way quantum communication protocols and semidefinite programming reformulations of LPs.

**40.    Broadband sum frequency generation via chirped quasi-phase-matching**  
A. A. Rangelov, N. V. Vitanov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1333  
<blockquote>
<p>
An efficient broadband sum frequency generation (SFG) technique using the two collinear optical parametric processes \omega 3=\omega 1+\omega 2 and \omega 4=\omega 1+\omega 3 is proposed. The technique uses chirped quasi-phase-matched gratings, which, in the undepleted pump approximation, make SFG analogous to adiabatic population transfer in three-state systems with crossing energies in quantum physics. If the local modulation period %for aperiodically poled quasi-phase-matching first makes the phase match occur for \omega 3 and then for \omega 4 SFG processes then the energy is converted adiabatically to the \omega 4 field. Efficient SFG of the \omega 4 field is also possible by the opposite direction of the local modulation sweep; then transient SFG of the \omega 3 field is strongly reduced. Most of these features remain valid in the nonlinear regime of depleted pump.

<blockquote>
<p>
The continuous limit of one dimensional discrete-time quantum walks with time- and space-dependent coefficients is investigated. A given quantum walk does not generally admit a continuous limit but some families (1-jets) of quantum walks do. All families (1-jets) admitting a continuous limit are identified. The continuous limit is described by a Dirac-like equation or, alternately, a couple of Klein-Gordon equations. Variational principles leading to these equations are also discussed, together with local invariance properties.

**43.    Sheaf Logic, Quantum Set Theory and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics**  
J. Benavides  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2704  
<blockquote>
<p>
Based on the Sheaf Logic approach to set theoretic forcing, a hierarchy of Quantum Variable Sets is constructed which generalizes and simplifies the analogous construction developed by Takeuti on boolean valued models of set theory. Over this model two alternative proofs of Takeuti's correspondence, between self adjoint operators and the real numbers of the model, are given. This approach results to be more constructive showing a direct relation with the Gelfand representation theorem, revealing also the importance of these results with respect to the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics in close connection with the Deutsch-Everett multiversal interpretation. Finally, it is shown how in this context the notion of genericity and the corresponding generic model theorem can help to explain the emergence of classicality also in connection with the Deutsch- Everett perspective.

**44.    Quantum Fourier sampling, Code Equivalence, and the quantum security of the McEliece and Sidelnikov cryptosystems**  
Hang Dinh, Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4382  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Code Equivalence problem is that of determining whether two given linear codes are equivalent to each other up to a permutation of the coordinates. This problem has a direct reduction to a nonabelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP), suggesting a possible quantum algorithm analogous to Shor's algorithms for factoring or discrete log. However, we recently showed that in many cases of interest---including Goppa codes---solving this case of the HSP requires rich, entangled measurements. Thus, solving these cases of Code Equivalence via Fourier sampling appears to be out of reach of current families of quantum algorithms. Code equivalence is directly related to the security of McEliece-type cryptosystems in the case where the private code is known to the adversary. However, for many codes the support splitting algorithm of Sendrier provides a classical attack in this case. We revisit the claims of our previous article in the light of these classical attacks, and discuss the particular case of the Sidelnikov cryptosystem, which is based on Reed-Muller codes.
