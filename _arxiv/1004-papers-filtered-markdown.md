Shigehito Miki, Taro Yamashita, Mikio Fujiwara, Masahide Sasaki, Zhen Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We developed a four-channel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector system based on a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler. All channels showed a system detection efficiency (at a 100 Hz dark-count rate) higher than 16% at 1550 nm wavelength, and the best channel showed a system DE of 21% and 30% at 1550 nm and 1310 nm wavelength, respectively.

**2.    Limitations of quantum computing with Gaussian cluster states**  
M. Ohliger, K. Kieling, J. Eisert  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042336 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0081  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the potential and limitations of Gaussian cluster states for measurement-based quantum computing. Using a framework of Gaussian projected entangled pair states (GPEPS), we show that no matter what Gaussian local measurements are performed on systems distributed on a general graph, transport and processing of quantum information is not possible beyond a certain influence region, except for exponentially suppressed corrections. We also demonstrate that even under arbitrary non-Gaussian local measurements, slabs of Gaussian cluster states of a finite width cannot carry logical quantum information, even if sophisticated encodings of qubits in continuous-variable (CV) systems are allowed for. This is proven by suitably contracting tensor networks representing infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The result can be seen as sharpening the requirements for quantum error correction and fault tolerance for Gaussian cluster states, and points towards the necessity of non-Gaussian resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. The results can equally be viewed as referring to Gaussian quantum repeater networks.

**3.    k-Boson Quantum Walks Do Not Distinguish Arbitrary Graphs**  
Jamie Smith  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0206  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we define k-equivalence, a relation on graphs that relies on their associated cellular algebras. We show that a k-Boson quantum walk cannot distinguish pairs of graphs that are k- equivalent. The existence of pairs of k-equivalent graphs has been shown by Ponomarenko et al. [2, 6]. This gives a negative answer to a question posed by Gamble et al. [7].

**4.    High-fidelity operation of quantum photonic circuits**  
Anthony Laing, Alberto Peruzzo, Alberto Politi, Maria Rodas Verde, Matthaeus Halder, Timothy C. Ralph, Mark G. Thompson, Jeremy L. O'Brien  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 211109 (2010)

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate photonic quantum circuits that operate at the stringent levels that will be required for future quantum information science and technology. These circuits are fabricated from silica-on-silicon waveguides forming directional couplers and interferometers. While our focus is on the operation of quantum circuits, to test this operation required construction of a spectrally tuned photon source to produce near-identical pairs of photons. We show non-classical interference with two photons and a two-photon entangling logic gate that operate with near-unit fidelity. These results are a significant step towards large-scale operation of photonic quantum circuits.

**5.    A Full Characterization of Quantum Advice**  
Scott Aaronson, Andrew Drucker  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0377  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove the following surprising result: given any quantum state rho on n qubits, there exists a local Hamiltonian H on poly(n) qubits (e.g., a sum of two-qubit interactions), such that any ground state of H can be used to simulate rho on all quantum circuits of fixed polynomial size. In terms of complexity classes, this implies that BQP/qpoly is contained in QMA/poly, which supersedes the previous result of Aaronson that BQP/qpoly is contained in PP/poly. Indeed, we can exactly characterize quantum advice, as equivalent in power to untrusted quantum advice combined with trusted classical advice. Proving our main result requires combining a large number of previous tools -- including a result of Alon et al. on learning of real-valued concept classes, a result of Aaronson on the learnability of quantum states, and a result of Aharonov and Regev on "QMA+ super-verifiers" -- and also creating some new ones. The main new tool is a so-called majority-certificates lemma, which is closely related to boosting in machine learning, and which seems likely to find independent applications. In its simplest version, this lemma says the following. Given any set S of Boolean functions on n variables, any function f in S can be expressed as the pointwise majority of m=O(n) functions f1,...,fm in S, such that each fi is the unique function in S compatible with O(log|S|) input/output constraints.

We study time-dependent discrete-time quantum walks on the one-dimensional lattice. We compute the limit distribution of a two-period quantum walk defined by two orthogonal matrices. For the symmetric case, the distribution is determined by one of two matrices. Moreover, limit theorems for two special cases are presented.

**7.    Limit theorems for quantum walks with memory**  
Norio Konno, Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0443  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently Mc Gettrick [1] introduced and studied a discrete-time 2-state quantum walk (QW) with a memory in one dimension. He gave an expression for the amplitude of the QW by path counting method. Moreover he showed that the return probability of the walk is more than 1/2 for any even time. In this paper, we compute the stationary distribution by considering the walk as a 4-state QW without memory. Our result is consistent with his claim. In addition, we obtain the weak limit theorem of the rescaled QW. This behavior is striking different from the corresponding classical random walk and the usual 2-state QW without memory as his numerical simulations suggested.

**8.    Graph Approach to Quantum Systems**  
Mladen Pavicic, Brendan D. McKay, Norman D. Megill, Kresimir Fresl  
Journal of Mathematical Physics, 51, 102103-1-31 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0776  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using a graph approach to quantum systems, we prove that descriptions of 3-dim Kochen-Specker (KS) setups as well as descriptions of 3-dim spin systems by means of Greechie lattices that we find in the literature are wrong. Correct lattices generated by McKay-Megill-Pavicic (MMP) hypergraphs and Hilbert subspace equations are given. To enable exhaustive generations of 3-dim KS setups by means of recently found "stripping technique," bipartite graph generation is used to provide us with lattices with equal numbers of elements and blocks (orthogonal triples of elements) - up to 41 of them. We obtain several new results on such lattices and hypergraphs, in particular on properties such as superposition and orthoraguesian equations. Since a bipartite graph approach has recently been applied to CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) and graph states on the one hand, and span programs, quantum walks, and quantum search on the other, our results also enable the study of these quantum information fields by means of hypergraphs and lattices.

**9.    Tailoring discrete quantum walk dynamics via extended initial conditions: Towards homogeneous probability distributions**  
Germán J. de Valcárcel, Eugenio Roldán, Alejandro Romanelli  
New J. Phys 12, 123022 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0976  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the evolution of initially extended distributions in the coined quantum walk on the line by analyzing the dispersion relation of the process and its associated wave equations. This allows us, in particular, to devise an initially extended condition leading to a uniform probability distribution whose width increases linearly with time, with increasing homogeneity.

**10.    Distribution of chirality in the quantum walk: Markov process and entanglement**  
Alejandro Romanelli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1134  
<blockquote>
<p>
The asymptotic behavior of the quantum walk on the line is investigated focusing on the probability distribution of chirality independently of position. The long-time limit of this distribution is shown to exist and to depend on the initial conditions, and it also determines the asymptotic value of the entanglement between the coin and the position. It is shown that for given asymptotic values of both the entanglement and the chirality distribution it is possible to find the corresponding initial conditions within a particular class of spatially extended Gaussian distributions. Moreover it is shown that the entanglement also measures the degree of Markovian randomness of the distribution of chirality.

**11.    Non-Markovian entanglement dynamics in the presence of system-bath coherence**  
Arend G. Dijkstra, Yoshitaka Tanimura  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 250401 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1450  
<blockquote>
<p>
A complete treatment of the entanglement of two-level systems, which evolves through the contact with a thermal bath, must include the fact that the system and the bath are not fully separable. Therefore, quantum coherent superpositions of system and bath states, which are almost never fully included in theoretical models, are invariably present when an entangled state is prepared experimentally. We show their importance for the time evolution of the entanglement of two qubits coupled to independent baths. In addition, our treatment is able to handle slow and low-temperature thermal baths.

**12.    Characterization of universal two-qubit Hamiltonians**  
Andrew M. Childs, Debbie Leung, Laura Man?inska, Maris Ozols  
Quantum Information and Computation 11, 19-39 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1645  
<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose we can apply a given 2-qubit Hamiltonian H to any (ordered) pair of qubits. We say H is n-universal if it can be used to approximate any unitary operation on n qubits. While it is well known that almost any 2-qubit Hamiltonian is 2-universal (Deutsch, Barenco, Ekert 1995; Lloyd 1995), an explicit characterization of the set of non-universal 2-qubit Hamiltonians has been elusive. Our main result is a complete characterization of 2-non-universal 2-qubit Hamiltonians. In particular, there are three ways that a 2-qubit Hamiltonian H can fail to be universal: (1) H shares an eigenvector with the gate that swaps two qubits, (2) H acts on the two qubits independently (in any of a certain family of bases), or (3) H has zero trace. A 2-non-universal 2-qubit Hamiltonian can still be n-universal for some n >= 3. We give some partial results on 3-universality. Finally, we also show how our characterization of 2-universal Hamiltonians implies the well-known result that almost any 2-qubit unitary is universal.

**13.    Quantum Transduction of Telecommunications-band Single Photons from a Quantum Dot by Frequency Upconversion**  
Matthew T. Rakher, Lijun Ma, Oliver Slattery, Xiao Tang, Kartik Srinivasan  
Nature Photonics 4, 786-791 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2686  
<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to transduce non-classical states of light from one wavelength to another is a requirement for integrating disparate quantum systems that take advantage of telecommunications-band photons for optical fiber transmission of quantum information and near-visible, stationary systems for manipulation and storage. In addition, transducing a single-photon source at 1.3 {\mu}m to visible wavelengths for detection would be integral to linear optical quantum computation due to the challenges of detection in the near-infrared. Recently, transduction at single-photon power levels has been accomplished through frequency upconversion, but it has yet to be demonstrated for a true single-photon source. Here, we transduce the triggered single-photon emission of a semiconductor quantum dot at 1.3 {\mu}m to 710 nm with a total detection (internal conversion) efficiency of 21% (75%). We demonstrate that the 710 nm signal maintains the quantum character of the 1.3 {\mu}m signal, yielding a photon anti-bunched second-order intensity correlation, g^(2)(t), that shows the optical field is composed of single photons with g^(2)(0) = 0.165 < 0.5.

**14.    On the adiabatic condition and the quantum hitting time of Markov chains**  
Hari Krovi, Maris Ozols, Jérémie Roland  
Physical Review A, 82(2):022333, 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2721  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an adiabatic quantum algorithm for the abstract problem of searching marked vertices in a graph, or spatial search. Given a random walk (or Markov chain) $P$ on a graph with a set of unknown marked vertices, one can define a related absorbing walk $P'$ where outgoing transitions from marked vertices are replaced by self-loops. We build a Hamiltonian $H(s)$ from the interpolated Markov chain $P(s)=(1-s)P+sP'$ and use it in an adiabatic quantum algorithm to drive an initial superposition over all vertices to a superposition over marked vertices. The adiabatic condition implies that for any reversible Markov chain and any set of marked vertices, the running time of the adiabatic algorithm is given by the square root of the classical hitting time. This algorithm therefore demonstrates a novel connection between the adiabatic condition and the classical notion of hitting time of a random walk. It also significantly extends the scope of previous quantum algorithms for this problem, which could only obtain a full quadratic speed-up for state-transitive reversible Markov chains with a unique marked vertex.

**15.    Bound on quantum computation time: Quantum error correction in a critical environment**  
E. Novais, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Harold U. Baranger  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 020303(R) (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3247  
<blockquote>
<p>
We obtain an upper bound on the time available for quantum computation for a given quantum computer and decohering environment with quantum error correction implemented. First, we derive an explicit quantum evolution operator for the logical qubits and show that it has the same form as that for the physical qubits but with a reduced coupling strength to the environment. Using this evolution operator, we find the trace distance between the real and ideal states of the logical qubits in two cases. For a super-Ohmic bath, the trace distance saturates, while for Ohmic or sub-Ohmic baths, there is a finite time before the trace distance exceeds a value set by the user.

**16.    Quantum Snake Walk on Graphs**  
Ansis Rosmanis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4054  
<blockquote>
<p>
I introduce a new type of continuous-time quantum walk on graphs called the quantum snake walk, the basis states of which are fixed-length paths (snakes) in the underlying graph. First I analyze the quantum snake walk on the line, and I show that, even though most states stay localized throughout the evolution, there are specific states which most likely move on the line as wave packets with momentum inversely proportional to the length of the snake. Next I discuss how an algorithm based on the quantum snake walk might potentially be able to solve an extended version of the glued trees problem which asks to find a path connecting both roots of the glued trees graph. No efficient quantum algorithm solving this problem is known yet.

**17.    Optimal control of population transfer in Markovian open quantum systems**  
Wei Cui, Zairong Xi, Yu Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4301  
<blockquote>
<p>
There has long been interest to control the transfer of population between specified quantum states. Recent work has optimized the control law for closed system population transfer by using a gradient ascent pulse engineer- ing algorithm [1]. Here, a spin-boson model consisting of two-level atoms which interact with the dissipative environment, is investigated. With opti- mal control, the quantum system can invert the populations of the quantum logic states. The temperature plays an important role in controlling popula- tion transfer. At low temperatures the control has active performance, while at high temperatures it has less erect. We also analyze the decoherence be- havior of open quantum systems with optimal population transfer control, and we find that these controls can prolong the coherence time. We hope that active optimal control can help quantum solid-state-based engineering.

**18.    Non-Markovian entanglement dynamics in coupled superconducting qubit systems**  
Wei Cui, Zairong Xi, Yu Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4303  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically analyze the entanglement generation and dynamics by coupled Josephson junction qubits. Considering a current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ), we generate maximally entangled states. In particular, the entanglement dynamics is considered as a function of the decoherence parameters, such as the temperature, the ratio $r\equiv\omega_c/\omega_0$ between the reservoir cutoff frequency $\omega_c$ and the system oscillator frequency $\omega_0$, % between $\omega_0$ the characteristic frequency of the %quantum system of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of %Ohmic reservoir and the energy levels split of the superconducting circuits in the non-Markovian master equation. We analyzed the entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB) by the non-Markovian master equation. Furthermore, we find that the larger the ratio $r$ and the thermal energy $k_BT$, the shorter the decoherence. In this superconducting qubit system we find that the entanglement can be controlled and the ESD time can be prolonged by adjusting the temperature and the superconducting phases $\Phi_k$ which split the energy levels.

**19.    Tunneling effects in a one-dimensional quantum walk**  
Mostafa Annabestani, Seyed Javad Akhtarshenas, Mohamad Reza Abolhassani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4352  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we investigate the effects of shifting position decoherence, arisen from the tunneling effect in the experimental realization of the quantum walk, on the one-dimensional discreet time quantum walk. We show that in the regime of this type of noise the quantum behavior of the walker does not fade, in contrary to the coin decoherence for which the walker undergos the quantum-to-classical transition even for weak noise. Particularly, we show that the quadratic dependency of the variance on the time and also the coin-position entanglement, i.e. two important quantum aspects of the coherent quantum walk, are preserved in the presence of tunneling decoherence. Furthermore, we present an explicit expression for the probability distribution of decoherent one-dimensional quantum walk in terms of the corresponding coherent probabilities, and show that this type of decoherence smooths the probability distribution.

**20.    Optimal control of non-Markovian open quantum systems via feedback**  
Zairong Xi, Wei Cui, Yu Pan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4659  
<blockquote>
<p>
The problem of optimal control of non-Markovian open quantum system via weak measurement is presented. Based on the non-Markovian master equation, we evaluate exactly the non-Markovian effect on the dynamics of the system of interest interacting with a dissipative reservoir. We find that the non-Markovian reservoir has dual effects on the system: dissipation and backaction. The dissipation exhausts the coherence of the quantum system, whereas the backaction revives it. Moreover, we design the control Hamiltonian with the control laws attained by the stochastic optimal control and the corresponding optimal principle. At last, we considered the exact decoherence dynamics of a qubit in a dissipative reservoir composed of harmonic oscillators, and demonstrated the effectiveness of our optimal control strategy. Simulation results showed that the coherence will completely lost in the absence of control neither in non-Markovian nor Markovian system. However, the optimal feedback control steers it to a stationary stochastic process which fluctuates around the target. In this case the decoherence can be controlled effectively, which indicates that the engineered artificial reservoirs with optimal feedback control may be designed to protect the quantum coherence in quantum information and quantum computation.

**21.    Minimal memory requirements for pearl-necklace encoders of quantum convolutional codes**  
Monireh Houshmand, Saied Hosseini-Khayat, Mark M. Wilde  
IEEE Transactions on Computers vol. 61, no. 3, pages 299-312 (March 2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5179  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the major goals in quantum information processing is to reduce the overhead associated with the practical implementation of quantum protocols, and often, routines for quantum error correction account for most of this overhead. A particular technique for quantum error correction that may be useful for protecting a stream of quantum information is quantum convolutional coding. The encoder for a quantum convolutional code has a representation as a convolutional encoder or as a "pearl-necklace" encoder. In the pearl-necklace representation, it has not been particularly clear in the research literature how much quantum memory such an encoder would require for implementation. Here, we offer an algorithm that answers this question. The algorithm first constructs a weighted, directed acyclic graph where each vertex of the graph corresponds to a gate string in the pearl-necklace encoder, and each path through the graph represents a path through non-commuting gates in the encoder. We show that the weight of the longest path through the graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. A dynamic programming search through this graph determines the longest path. The running time for the construction of the graph and search through it is quadratic in the number of gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.

**22.    Parameter estimation of quantum processes using convex optimization**  
Gábor Balló, Katalin M. Hangos  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5209  
<blockquote>
<p>
A convex optimization based method is proposed for quantum process tomography, in the case of known channel model structure, but unknown channel parameters. The main idea is to select an affine parametrization of the Choi matrix as a set of optimization variables, and formulate a semidefinite programming problem with a least squares objective function. Possible convex relations between the optimization variables are also taken into account to improve the estimation. Simulation case studies show, that the proposed method can significantly increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation, if the channel model structure is known. Beside the convex part, the determination of the channel parameters from the optimization variables is a nonconvex step in general. In the case of Pauli channels however, the method reduces to a purely convex optimization problem, allowing to obtain a globally optimal solution.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5286  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a definition for the P\'olya number of continuous-time quantum walks to characterize their recurrence properties. The definition involves a series of measurements on the system, each carried out on a different member from an ensemble in order to minimize the disturbance caused by it. We examine various graphs, including the ring, the line, higher dimensional integer lattices and a number of other graphs and calculate their P\'olya number. For the timing of the measurements a Poisson process as well as regular timing are discussed. We find that the speed of decay for the probability at the origin is the key for recurrence.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5394

<p>
We introduce and study a class of discrete-time quantum walks on a one-dimensional lattice. In contrast to the standard homogeneous quantum walks, coin operators are inhomogeneous and depend on their positions in this class of models. The models are shown to be self-dual with respect to the Fourier transform, which is analogous to the Aubry-Andr\'e model describing the one-dimensional tight-binding model with a quasi-periodic potential. When the period of coin operators is incommensurate to the lattice spacing, we rigorously show that the limit distribution of the quantum walk is localized at the origin. We also numerically study the eigenvalues of the one-step time evolution operator and find the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum which indicates the fractal nature of this class of quantum walks.

We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the entropy rate of the system to be zero under any system-environment Hamiltonian interaction. We call the class of system-environment states that satisfy this condition lazy states. They are a generalization of classically correlated states defined by quantum discord, but based on projective measurements of any rank. The concept of lazy states permits the construction of a protocol for detecting global quantum correlations using only local dynamical information. We show how quantum correlations to the environment provide bounds to the entropy rate, and how to estimate dissipation rates for general non-Markovian open quantum systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
An extension of the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation to a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junction with multiple tunneling channels is derived. Appling the resultant relation to a SIS Josephson junction formed by an iron-based (five-band) and a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type superconductors, a theoretical bound of the Josephson critical current ($I_{\rm c}$) multiplied by the resistance of the junction ($R_{\rm n}$) is given. We reveal that such a bound is useful for identifying the pairing symmetry of iron-pnictide superconductors. One finds that if a measured value of $I_{\rm c}R_{\rm n}$ is smaller than the bound then the symmetry is $\pm s$-wave, and otherwise $s$-wave without any sign changes. In addition, we stress that temperature dependence of $I_{\rm c}R_{\rm n}$ is sensitive to the difference of the gap functions from the BCS type gap formula in the above heterojunction.

**28.    Thermal entanglement of Hubbard dimers in the nonextensive statistics**  
Hideo Hasegawa  
Physica A 390 (2011) 1486  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0530  
<blockquote>
<p>
The thermal entanglement of the Hubbard dimer (two-site Hubbard model) has been studied with the nonextensive statistics. We have calculated the auto-correlation ($O_q$), pair correlation ($L_q$), concurrence ($\Gamma_q$) and conditional entropy ($R_q$) as functions of entropic index $q$ and the temperature $T$. The thermal entanglement is shown to considerably depend on the entropic index. For $q < 1.0$, the threshold temperature where $\Gamma_q$ vanishes or $R_q$ changes its sign is more increased and the entanglement may survive at higher temperatures than for $q=1.0$. Relations among $L_q$, $\Gamma_q$ and $R_q$ are investigated. The physical meaning of the entropic index $q$ is discussed with the microcanonical and superstatistical approaches. The nonextensive statistics is applied also to Heisenberg dimers.

We propose a scheme for full Bell state measurement of spin qubits in a double quantum dot. Our scheme consists of Pauli spin-blockade measurements and biaxial electron-spin resonance. In order to eliminate the average of the Zeeman fields, the double quantum dot is designed so that the Land\'e g-factors of first and second dots satisfy g1=g2 with the use of g-factor engineering. Thus, we can swap one of the three spin-triplet states for the spin-singlet state without disturbing the other states. Our study shows that the sequential spin-to-charge conversions enable us to implement the full Bell state measurement of electron-spin qubits.

Entanglement is one of the key resources required for quantum computation, so experimentally creating and measuring entangled states is of crucial importance in the various physical implementations of a quantum computer. In superconducting qubits, two-qubit entangled states have been demonstrated and used to show violations of Bell's Inequality and to implement simple quantum algorithms. Unlike the two-qubit case, however, where all maximally-entangled two-qubit states are equivalent up to local changes of basis, three qubits can be entangled in two fundamentally different ways, typified by the states $|\mathrm{GHZ}> = (|000> + |111>)/\sqrt{2}$ and $|\mathrm{W}> = (|001> + |010> + |100>)/\sqrt{3}$. Here we demonstrate the operation of three coupled superconducting phase qubits and use them to create and measure $|\mathrm{GHZ}>$ and $|\mathrm{W}>$ states. The states are fully characterized using quantum state tomography and are shown to satisfy entanglement witnesses, confirming that they are indeed examples of three-qubit entanglement and are not separable into mixtures of two-qubit entanglement.

Traditionally, quantum entanglement has played a central role in foundational discussions of quantum mechanics. The measurement of correlations between entangled particles can exhibit results at odds with classical behavior. These discrepancies increase exponentially with the number of entangled particles. When entanglement is extended from just two quantum bits (qubits) to three, the incompatibilities between classical and quantum correlation properties can change from a violation of inequalities involving statistical averages to sign differences in deterministic observations. With the ample confirmation of quantum mechanical predictions by experiments, entanglement has evolved from a philosophical conundrum to a key resource for quantum-based technologies, like quantum cryptography and computation. In particular, maximal entanglement of more than two qubits is crucial to the implementation of quantum error correction protocols. While entanglement of up to 3, 5, and 8 qubits has been demonstrated among spins, photons, and ions, respectively, entanglement in engineered solid-state systems has been limited to two qubits. Here, we demonstrate three-qubit entanglement in a superconducting circuit, creating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with fidelity of 88%, measured with quantum state tomography. Several entanglement witnesses show violation of bi-separable bounds by 830\pm80%. Our entangling sequence realizes the first step of basic quantum error correction, namely the encoding of a logical qubit into a manifold of GHZ-like states using a repetition code. The integration of encoding, decoding and error-correcting steps in a feedback loop will be the next milestone for quantum computing with integrated circuits.

We present a measurement of phonon propagation in a silicon wafer utilizing an array of frequency-multiplexed superconducting resonators coupled to a single transmission line. The electronic readout permits fully synchronous array sampling with a per-resonator bandwidth of 1.2 MHz, allowing sub-$\mu$s array imaging. This technological achievement is potentially vital in a variety of low-temperature applications, including single-photon counting, quantum-computing and dark-matter searches.

**34.    Quantum Fourier transform, Heisenberg groups and quasiprobability distributions**

This paper aims to explore the inherent connection among Heisenberg groups, quantum Fourier transform and (quasiprobability) distribution functions. Distribution functions for continuous and finite quantum systems are examined first as a semiclassical approach to quantum probability distribution. This leads to studying certain functionals of a pair of "conjugate" observables, connected via the quantum Fourier transform. The Heisenberg groups emerge naturally from this study and we take a rapid look at their representations. The quantum Fourier transform appears as the intertwining operator of two equivalent representation arising out of an automorphism of the group. Distribution functions correspond to certain distinguished sets in the group algebra. The marginal properties of a particular class of distribution functions (Wigner distributions) arise from a class of automorphisms of the group algebra of the Heisenberg group. We then study the reconstruction of Wigner function from the marginal distributions via inverse Radon transform giving explicit formulas. We consider applications of our approach to quantum information processing and quantum process tomography.

**35.    Bounds for mixing time of quantum walks on finite graphs**

<blockquote>
<p>
Several inequalities are proved for the mixing time of discrete-time quantum walks on finite graphs. The mixing time is defined differently than in Aharonov, Ambainis, Kempe and Vazirani (2001) and it is found that for particular examples of walks on a cycle, a hypercube and a complete graph, quantum walks provide no speed-up in mixing over the classical counterparts. In addition, non-unitary quantum walks (i.e., walks with decoherence) are considered and a criterion for their convergence to the unique stationary distribution is derived.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a theory of frequency-dependent counting statistics of electron transport through nanostructures within the framework of Markovian quantum master equations. Our method allows the calculation of finite-frequency current cumulants of arbitrary order, as we explicitly show for the second- and third-order cumulants. Our formulae generalize previous zero-frequency expressions in the literature and can be viewed as an extension of MacDonald's formula beyond shot noise. When combined with an appropriate treatment of tunneling, using, e.g. Liouvillian perturbation theory in Laplace space, our method can deal with arbitrary bias voltages and frequencies, as we illustrate with the paradigmatic example of transport through a single resonant level model. We discuss various interesting limits, including the recovery of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem near linear response, as well as some drawbacks inherent of the Markovian description arising from the neglect of quantum fluctuations.
