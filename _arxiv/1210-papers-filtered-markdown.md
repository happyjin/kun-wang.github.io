**1.    On the Automation of Encoding Processes in the Quantum IO Monad**  
James Barratt  
EPTCS 95, 2012, pp. 15-19  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0611  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is now clear that the use of resilient encoding schemes will be required for any quantum computing device to be realised. However, quantum programmers of the future will not wish to be tied up in the particulars of such encoding schemes. Quantum programming languages and libraries are already being developed, one of which is the Quantum IO Monad. QIO, as it is often abbreviated to, provides an interface to define and simulate quantum computations via a library of functions written in Haskell, a purely functional programming language. A solution is presented that takes an arbitrary QIO program and returns an equivalent program incorporating some specified quantum error correction techniques.

**2.    Summoning Information in Spacetime, or Where and When Can a Qubit Be?**  
Patrick Hayden, Alex May  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0913  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most important properties of quantum information, and the one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications, is that it can't be copied. That statement, however, is not completely accurate. While the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from being copied in space, the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requires that the information be copied in time. In spacetime as a whole, therefore, quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully characterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum information. Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum error correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined trajectories. Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of spacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning principle is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational question of exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points, showing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation and codeword-stabilized quantum codes. This provides a simple and complete description of where and when a qubit can be located in spacetime, revealing a remarkable variety of possibilities.

**3.    Breakdown of the cross-Kerr scheme for Photon Counting**  
Bixuan Fan, Anton F. Kockum, Joshua Combes, G?ran Johansson, Io-chun Hoi, Christopher Wilson, Per Delsing, G. J. Milburn, Thomas M. Stace  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 053601 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0991  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show, in the context of single photon detection, that an atomic three-level model for a transmon in a transmission line does not support the predictions of the nonlinear polarisability model known as the cross-Kerr effect. We show that the induced displacement of a probe in the presence or absence of a single photon in the signal field, cannot be resolved above the quantum noise in the probe. This strongly suggests that cross-Kerr media are not suitable for photon counting or related single photon applications. Our results are presented in the context of a transmon in a one dimensional microwave waveguide, but the conclusions also apply to optical systems.

**4.    A Faithful Communication Hamiltonian in Photonic Lattices**  
Matthieu Bellec, Georgios M. Nikolopoulos, Stelios Tzortzakis  
Optics Letters vol. 37, 4504 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1009  
<blockquote>
<p>
Faithful communication is a necessary precondition for large scale all-optical networking and quantum information processing. Related theoretical investigations in different areas of physics have led to various proposals in which finite discrete lattices are used as channels for short-distance communication tasks. Here, in the framework of femtosecond-laser-written waveguide arrays, we present the first experimental realization of such a channel with judiciously engineered couplings.

**5.    Improved Quantum Query Algorithms for Triangle Finding and Associativity Testing**  
Troy Lee, Frederic Magniez, Miklos Santha  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1014  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the quantum query complexity of detecting if an $n$-vertex graph contains a triangle is $O(n^{9/7})$. This improves the previous best algorithm of Belovs making $O(n^{35/27})$ queries. For the problem of determining if an operation $\circ : S \times S \rightarrow S$ is associative, we give an algorithm making $O(|S|^{10/7})$ queries, the first improvement to the trivial $O(|S|^{3/2})$ application of Grover search. Our algorithms are designed using the learning graph framework of Belovs. We give a family of algorithms for detecting constant-sized subgraphs, which can possibly be directed and colored. These algorithms are designed in a simple high-level language; our main theorem shows how this high-level language can be compiled as a learning graph and gives the resulting complexity. The key idea to our improvements is to allow more freedom in the parameters of the database kept by the algorithm. As in our previous work, the edge slots maintained in the database are specified by a graph whose edges are the union of regular bipartite graphs, the overall structure of which mimics that of the graph of the certificate. By allowing these bipartite graphs to be unbalanced and of variable degree we obtain better algorithms.

**6.    Decoy-State Quantum Key Distribution with Nonclassical Light Generated in a One-dimensional Waveguide**  
Huaixiu Zheng, Daniel J. Gauthier, Harold U. Baranger  
Opt. Lett. 38, 622 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1113  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme with a sub-Poissonian single-photon source, which is generated on demand by scattering a coherent state off a two-level system in a one-dimensional waveguide. We show that, compared to coherent state decoy-state QKD, there is a two-fold increase of the key generation rate. Furthermore, the performance is shown to be robust against both parameter variations and loss effects of the system.

**7.    Quantum algorithms for search with wildcards and combinatorial group testing**  
Andris Ambainis, Ashley Montanaro  
Quantum Information & Computation, vol. 14 no. 5&6, pp. 439-453, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1148  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider two combinatorial problems. The first we call "search with wildcards": given an unknown n-bit string x, and the ability to check whether any subset of the bits of x is equal to a provided query string, the goal is to output x. We give a nearly optimal O(sqrt(n) log n) quantum query algorithm for search with wildcards, beating the classical lower bound of Omega(n) queries. Rather than using amplitude amplification or a quantum walk, our algorithm is ultimately based on the solution to a state discrimination problem. The second problem we consider is combinatorial group testing, which is the task of identifying a subset of at most k special items out of a set of n items, given the ability to make queries of the form "does the set S contain any special items?" for any subset S of the n items. We give a simple quantum algorithm which uses O(k log k) queries to solve this problem, as compared with the classical lower bound of Omega(k log(n/k)) queries.

**8.    Nested Quantum Walks with Quantum Data Structures**  
Stacey Jeffery, Robin Kothari, Frederic Magniez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1199  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a new framework that extends the quantum walk framework of Magniez, Nayak, Roland, and Santha, by utilizing the idea of quantum data structures to construct an efficient method of nesting quantum walks. Surprisingly, only classical data structures were considered before for searching via quantum walks. The recently proposed learning graph framework of Belovs has yielded improved upper bounds for several problems, including triangle finding and more general subgraph detection. We exhibit the power of our framework by giving a simple explicit constructions that reproduce both the $O(n^{35/27})$ and $O(n^{9/7})$ learning graph upper bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for triangle finding, and discuss how other known upper bounds in the original learning graph framework can be converted to algorithms in our framework. We hope that the ease of use of this framework will lead to the discovery of new upper bounds.

**9.    Quantum Fourier Transforms and the Complexity of Link Invariants for Quantum Doubles of Finite Groups**  
Hari Krovi, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1550  
<blockquote>
<p>
Knot and link invariants naturally arise from any braided Hopf algebra. We consider the computational complexity of the invariants arising from an elementary family of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras: quantum doubles of finite groups (denoted D(G), for a group G). Regarding algorithms for these invariants, we develop quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform over D(G); in general, we show that when one can uniformly and efficiently carry out the quantum Fourier transform over the centralizers Z(g) of the elements of G, one can efficiently carry out the quantum Fourier transform over D(G). We apply these results to the symmetric groups to yield efficient circuits for the quantum Fourier transform over D(S_n). With such a Fourier transform, it is straightforward to obtain additive approximation algorithms for the related link invariant. Additionally, we show that certain D(G) invariants (such as D(A_n) invariants) are BPP-hard to additively approximate, SBP-hard to multiplicatively approximate, and #P-hard to exactly evaluate. Finally, we make partial progress on the question of simulating anyonic computation in groups uniformly as a function of the group size. In this direction, we provide efficient quantum circuits for the Clebsch-Gordan transform over D(G) for "fluxon" irreps, i.e., irreps of D(G) characterized by a conjugacy class of G. For general irreps, i.e., those which are associated with a conjugacy class of G and an irrep of a centralizer, we present an efficient implementation under certain conditions such as when there is an efficient Clebsch-Gordan transform over the centralizers. We remark that this also provides a simulation of certain anyonic models of quantum computation, even in circumstances where the group may have size exponential in the size of the circuit.

**10.    Quantum light generation on a silicon chip using waveguides and resonators**  
Jun Rong Ong, Shayan Mookherjea  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1586  
<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated optical devices may replace bulk crystal or fiber based assemblies with a more compact and controllable photon pair and heralded single photon source and generate quantum light at telecommunications wavelengths. Here, we propose that a periodic waveguide consisting of a sequence of optical resonators may outperform conventional waveguides or single resonators and generate more than 1 Giga-pairs per second from a sub-millimeter-long room-temperature silicon device, pumped with only about 10 milliwatts of optical power. Furthermore, the spectral properties of such devices provide novel opportunities of wavelength-division multiplexed chip-scale quantum light sources.

**11.    Nonlocality and Entanglement for Symmetric States**  
Zizhu Wang, Damian Markham  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 012104 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1754  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, building on some recent progress combined with numerical techniques, we shed some new light on how the nonlocality of symmetric states is related to their entanglement properties and potential usefulness in quantum information processing. We use semidefinite programming techniques to devise a device independent classification of three four qubit states into two classes inequivalent under local unitaries and permutation of systems (LUP). We study nonlocal properties when the number of parties grows large for two important classes of symmetric states: the W states and the GHZ states, showing that they behave differently under the inequalities we consider. We also discuss the monogamy arising from the nonlocal correlations of symmetric states. We show that although monogamy in a strict sense is not guaranteed for all symmetric states, strict monogamy is achievable for all Dicke states when the number of parties goes to infinity, as shown by an inequality based on a recent work studying the nonlocality (and showing strict monogamy) of W states.

**12.    Revisiting the hopes for scalable quantum computation**  
M. I. Dyakonov  
JETP Letters, v. 98, p. 514 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1782  
<blockquote>
<p>
The hopes for scalable quantum computing rely on the "threshold theorem": once the error per qubit per gate is below a certain value, the methods of quantum error correction allow indefinitely long quantum computations. The proof is based on a number of assumptions, which are supposed to be satisfied exactly, like axioms, e.g. zero undesired interactions between qubits, etc. However in the physical world no continuous quantity can be exactly zero, it can only be more or less small. Thus the "error per qubit per gate" threshold must be complemented by the required precision with which each assumption should be fulfilled. This issue was never addressed. In the absence of this crucial information, the prospects of scalable quantum computing remain uncertain.

**13.    Fractional Quantum Field Theory, Path Integral, and Stochastic Differential Equation for Strongly Interacting Many-Particle Systems**  
H. Kleinert  
EPL, 100 (2012) 10001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2630  
<blockquote>
<p>
While free and weakly interacting particles are well described by a a second-quantized nonlinear Schr\"odinger field, or relativistic versions of it, the fields of strongly interacting particles are governed by effective actions, whose quadratic terms are extremized by fractional wave equations. Their particle orbits perform universal L\'evy walks rather than Gaussian random walks with perturbations.

**14.    Quantum random walk in periodic potential on a line**  
Min Li, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Guang-Can Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3112  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigated the discrete-time quantum random walks on a line in periodic potential. The probability distribution with periodic potential is more complex compared to the normal quantum walks, and the standard deviation $\sigma$ has interesting behaviors for different period $q$ and parameter $\theta$. We studied the behavior of standard deviation with variation in walk steps, period, and $\theta$. The standard deviation increases approximately linearly with $\theta$ and decreases with $1/q$ for $\theta\in(0,\pi/4)$, and increases approximately linearly with $1/q$ for $\theta\in[\pi/4,\pi/2)$. When $q=2$, the standard deviation is lazy for $\theta\in[\pi/4+n\pi,3\pi/4+n\pi],n\in Z$.

Min Li, YOng-Sheng Zhang, Guang-Can Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3118  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigated discrete-time quantum walks with an arbitary unitary coin. Here we discover that the average position $<x> =\max(<x> \sin(\alpha+\gamma)$, while the initial state is $1/\sqrt{2}(\mid0L>+i\mid0R>)$. We prove the result and get some symmetry properties of quantum walks with a U(2) coin with $\mid0L>$ and $\mid0R>$ as the initial state.

**16.    Quantum memories and error correction**  
James R. Wootton  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3207  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum states are inherently fragile, making their storage a major concern for many practical applications and experimental tests of quantum mechanics. The field of quantum memories is concerned with how this storage may be achieved, covering everything from the physical systems best suited to the task to the abstract methods that may be used to increase performance. This review concerns itself with the latter, giving an overview of error correction and self-correction, and how they may be used to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. The planar code is presented as a concrete example, both as a quantum memory and as a framework for quantum computation.

**17.    Multilevel distillation of magic states for quantum computing**  
Cody Jones  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3388  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a procedure for distilling magic states used in universal quantum computing that requires substantially fewer initial resources than prior schemes. Our distillation circuit is based on a family of concatenated quantum codes that possess a transversal Hadamard operation, enabling each of these codes to distill the eigenstate of the Hadamard operator. A crucial result of this design is that low-fidelity magic states can be consumed to purify other high-fidelity magic states to even higher fidelity, which we call "multilevel distillation." When distilling in the asymptotic regime of infidelity $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ for each input magic state, the number of input magic states consumed on average to yield an output state with infidelity $O(\epsilon^{2^r})$ approaches $2^r+1$, which comes close to saturating the conjectured bound in [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052329]. We show numerically that there exist multilevel protocols such that the average number of magic states consumed to distill from error rate $\epsilon_{\mathrm{in}} = 0.01$ to $\epsilon_{\mathrm{out}}$ in the range $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-40}$ is about $14\log_{10}(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{out}}) - 40$; the efficiency of multilevel distillation dominates all other reported protocols when distilling Hadamard magic states from initial infidelity 0.01 to any final infidelity below $10^{-7}$. These methods are an important advance for magic-state distillation circuits in high-performance quantum computing, and they provide insight into the limitations of nearly resource-optimal quantum error correction.

**18.    Multipartite entanglement and Grover's search algorithm**  
Ri Qu, Juan Wang, Zong-shang Li, Su-li Zhao, Yan-ru Bao, Xiao-chun Cao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3418  
<blockquote>
<p>
We firstly investigate the multipartite entanglement features of the quantum states, including the iteration states achieved by repeated application of Grover iteration and the Oracle ones into which the above iteration states evolve by applying single Oracle operation, employed in Grover's search algorithm by means of the separable degree and the entanglement measure. Then we give the quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the entanglement dynamics in Grover's search algorithm. Our results show that for most instances (i) the separable degrees of these states and ranges of their maximum Schmidt numbers are invariable by following the dynamics of Grover's search algorithm; (ii) the dynamics of Grover's search algorithm is almost "filled" by the fully entangled states.

**19.    Braiding Interactions in Anyonic Quantum Walks**  
Lauri J. Lehman, Vaclav Zatloukal, Jiannis K. Pachos, Gavin K. Brennen  
Quantum Computers and Computing, 2012, 12 (1), pp. 51-62  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3446  
<blockquote>
<p>
The anyonic quantum walk is a dynamical model describing a single anyon propagating along a chain of stationary anyons and interacting via mutual braiding statistics. We review the recent results on the effects of braiding statistics in anyonic quantum walks in quasi-one dimensional ladder geometries. For anyons which correspond to spin-1/2 irreps of the quantum groups $SU(2)_k$, the non-Abelian species $(1<k<\infty)$ gives rise to entanglement between the walker and topological degrees of freedom which is quantified by quantum link invariants over the trajectories of the walk. The decoherence is strong enough to reduce the walk on the infinite ladder to classical like behaviour. We also present numerical results on mixing times of $SU(2)_2$ or Ising model anyon walks on cyclic graphs. Finally, the possible experimental simulation of the anyonic quantum walk in Fractional Quantum Hall systems is discussed.

**20.    A short walk through quantum optomechanics**  
P. Meystre  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3619  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper gives an brief review of the basic physics of quantum optomechanics and provides an overview of some of its recent developments and current areas of focus. It first outlines the basic theory of cavity optomechanical cooling and gives a brief status report of the experimental state-of-the-art. It then turns to the deep quantum regime of operation of optomechanical oscillators and cover selected aspects of quantum state preparation, control and characterization, including mechanical squeezing and pulsed optomechanics. This is followed by a discussion of the "bottom-up" approach that exploits ultracold atomic samples instead of nanoscale systems. It concludes with an outlook that concentrates largely on the functionalization of quantum optomechanical systems and their promise in metrology applications.

**21.    Time-optimal quantum computation**  
Austin G. Fowler  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4626  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given any quantum error correcting code permitting universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and transversal measurement of logical X and Z, we describe how to perform time-optimal quantum computation, meaning the execution of an arbitrary Clifford circuit followed by a layer of independent T gates and any necessary feedforward measurement determined corrective S gates all in the time of a single physical measurement. We assume fast classical processing and classical communication, and argue the reasonableness of this assumption. This enables fault-tolerant quantum computation to be performed orders of magnitude faster than previously thought possible, with the execution time independent of the error correction strength.

**22.    Universal quantum simulation with pre-threshold superconducting qubits: Single-excitation subspace method**  
Michael R. Geller, John M. Martinis, Andrew T. Sornborger, Phillip C. Stancil, Emily J. Pritchett, Andrei Galiautdinov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5260  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a method for general-purpose quantum computation and simulation that is well suited for today's pre-threshold-fidelity superconducting qubits. This approach makes use of the $n$-dimensional single-excitation subspace (SES) of a system of $n$ tunably coupled qubits. It can be viewed as a nonscalable special case of the standard gate-based quantum computing model, but allows many operations in the unitary group SU($n$) to be implemented by a single application of the Hamiltonian. Our approach bypasses the need to decompose the evolution operator into elementary gates, making large, nontrivial computations possible without error correction. The method is especially well suited for universal quantum simulation, specifically simulation of the Schr\"odinger equation with a real but otherwise arbitrary $n \times n$ Hamiltonian. We argue that a 1000-qubit SES processor, which would require no known improvements in superconducting device technology and which could be built today, should be capable of achieving quantum speedup relative to a petaflop supercomputer. We speculate on the utility and practicality of such a universal quantum simulator.

**23.    Non-Markovianity and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-Bell inequality violation in quantum dissipative systems**  
A. Thilagam, A. R. Usha Devi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5291  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the non-Markovian dynamics in a multipartite system of two initially correlated atomic qubits, each located in a single-mode leaky cavity and interacting with its own bosonic reservoir. We show the dominance of non-Markovian features, as quantified by the difference in fidelity of the evolved system with its density matrix at an earlier time, in three specific two-qubit partitions associated with the cavity-cavity and atom-reservoir density matrices within the same subsystem, and the cavity-reservoir reduced matrix across the two subsystems. The non-Markovianity in the cavity-cavity subsystem is seen to be optimized in the vicinity of the exceptional point. The CHSH-Bell inequality computed for various two-qubit partitions show that high non-locality present in a specific subsystem appears in conjunction with enhanced non-Markovian dynamics in adjacent subsystems. This is in contrast to the matching existence of non-locality and quantum correlations in regions spanned by time t and the cavity decay rate for select partitions. We discuss the applicability of these results to photosynthetic systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
We trace back the phenomenon of "delayed-choice entanglement swapping" as it was realized in a recent experiment to the commutativity of the projection operators that are involved in the corresponding measurement process. We also propose an experimental set-up which depends on the order of successive measurements corresponding to noncommutative projection operators. In this case entanglement swapping is used to teleport a quantum state from Alice to Bob, where Bob has now the possibility to examine the noncommutativity within the quantum history.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 060502 (2013)

<blockquote>
<p>
We use the electronic spin of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defect in diamond to observe the real-time evolution of neighboring single nuclear spins under ambient conditions. Using a diamond sample with a natural abundance of $^{13}$C isotopes, we first demonstrate high fidelity initialization and single-shot readout of an individual $^{13}$C nuclear spin. By including the intrinsic $^{14}$N nuclear spin of the NV defect in the quantum register, we then report the simultaneous observation of quantum jumps linked to both nuclear spin species, providing an efficient initialization of the two qubits. These results open up new avenues for diamond-based quantum information processing including active feedback in quantum error correction protocols and tests of quantum correlations with solid-state single spins at room temperature.

**26.    Quantum de Finetti Theorems under Local Measurements with Applications**  
Fernando G. S. L. Brandao, Aram W. Harrow  
Proc. of the 45th ACM Symposium on theory of computing (STOC 2013), pp. 861-870  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6367  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum de Finetti theorems are a useful tool in the study of correlations in quantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local measurements one can get a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the subsystems. We also obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We give the following applications of the results: We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the exponential time hypothesis. We show that the maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated in polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m variables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the maximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m^{1/2})-player one-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m^{1/2}) bits all together. We show that the optimization of certain polynomials over the hypersphere can be performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by considering O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of semidefinite programs. As an application to entanglement theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding multipartite separability. We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit state one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by measuring only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to merely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum multipartite state. The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information theory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual information.

**27.    Error Estimation, Error Correction and Verification In Quantum Key Distribution**  
?ystein Mar?y, Magne Gudmundsen, Lars Lydersen, Johannes Skaar  
IET Inf. Secur. 8, 277-282 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6520  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider error correction in quantum key distribution. To avoid that Alice and Bob unwittingly end up with different keys precautions must be taken. Before running the error correction protocol, Bob and Alice normally sacrifice some bits to estimate the error rate. To reduce the probability that they end up with different keys to an acceptable level, we show that a large number of bits must be sacrificed. Instead, if Alice and Bob can make a good guess about the error rate before the error correction, they can verify that their keys are similar after the error correction protocol. This verification can be done by utilizing properties of Low Density Parity Check codes used in the error correction. We compare the methods and show that by verification it is often possible to sacrifice less bits without compromising security. The improvement is heavily dependent on the error rate and the block length, but for a key produced by the IdQuantique system Clavis^2, the increase in the key rate is approximately 5 percent. We also show that for systems with large fluctuations in the error rate a combination of the two methods is optimal.

**28.    Measure of decoherence in quantum error correction for solid-state quantum computing**  
Alexey A. Melnikov, Leonid E. Fedichkin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6590  
<blockquote>
<p>
We considered the interaction of semiconductor quantum register with noisy environment leading to various types of qubit errors. We analysed both phase and amplitude decays during the process of electron-phonon interaction. The performance of quantum error correction codes (QECC) which will be inevitably used in full scale quantum information processors was studied in realistic conditions in semiconductor nanostructures. As a hardware basis for quantum bit we chose the quantum spatial states of single electron in semiconductor coupled double quantum dot system. The modified 5- and 9-qubit quantum error correction (QEC) algorithms by Shor and DiVincenzo without error syndrome extraction were applied to quantum register. 5-qubit error correction procedures were implemented for Si charge double dot qubits in the presence of acoustic phonon environment. Chi-matrix, Choi-Jamiolkowski state and measure of decoherence techniques were used to quantify qubit fault-tolerance. Our results showed that the introduction of above quantum error correction techniques at small phonon noise levels provided quadratic improvement of output error rates. The efficiency of 5-qubits quantum error correction algorithm in semiconductor quantum information processors was demonstrated.

We provide further characterization of non-Markovian quantum dynamics based on the concept of divisible dynamical maps. In analogy to entanglement witness we propose a non-Markovianity witness and introduce the corresponding measure of non-Markovianity. We also provide characterization of non-Markovianity in terms of entropic quantities, fidelity and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information.

**31.    Quantum-criticality-induced strong Kerr nonlinearities in optomechanical systems**

Scientific Reports 3, 2943 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8299  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a hybrid electro-optomechanical system that allows us to obtain controllable strong Kerr nonlinearities in the weak-coupling regime. We show that when the controllable electromechanical subsystem is close to its quantum critical point, strong photon-photon interactions can be generated by adjusting the intensity (or frequency) of the microwave driving field. Nonlinear optical phenomena, such as the appearance of the photon blockade and the generation of nonclassical states (e.g., Schr\"{o}dinger cat states), are predicted in the weak-coupling regime, which is feasible for most current optomechanical experiments.

**32.    Theory of quantum frequency conversion and type-II parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime**

New J. Phys. 15 053038 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8342  
<blockquote>
<p>
Frequency conversion (FC) and type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) processes serve as basic building blocks for the implementation of quantum optical experiments: type-II PDC enables the efficient creation of quantum states such as photon-number states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-states (EPR-states). FC gives rise to technologies enabling efficient atom-photon coupling, ultrafast pulse gates and enhanced detection schemes. However, despite their widespread deployment, their theoretical treatment remains challenging. Especially the multi-photon components in the high-gain regime as well as the explicit time-dependence of the involved Hamiltonians hamper an efficient theoretical description of these nonlinear optical processes. In this paper, we investigate these effects and put forward two models that enable a full description of FC and type-II PDC in the high-gain regime. We present a rigorous numerical model relying on the solution of coupled integro-differential equations that covers the complete dynamics of the process. As an alternative, we develop a simplified model that, at the expense of neglecting time-ordering effects, enables an analytical solution. While the simplified model approximates the correct solution with high fidelity in a broad parameter range, sufficient for many experimental situations, such as FC with low efficiency, entangled photon-pair generation and the heralding of single photons from type-II PDC, our investigations reveal that the rigorous model predicts a decreased performance for FC processes in quantum pulse gate applications and an enhanced EPR-state generation rate during type-II PDC, when EPR squeezing values above 12 dB are considered.

**33.    Adiabatic Quantum Programming: Minor Embedding With Hard Faults**  
Christine Klymko, Blair D. Sullivan, Travis S. Humble  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8395  
<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic quantum programming defines the time-dependent mapping of a quantum algorithm into an underlying hardware or logical fabric. An essential step is embedding problem-specific information into the quantum logical fabric. We present algorithms for embedding arbitrary instances of the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm into a square lattice of specialized unit cells. These methods extend with fabric growth while scaling linearly in time and quadratically in footprint. We also provide methods for handling hard faults in the logical fabric without invoking approximations to the original problem, and illustrate their versatility through numerical studies of embeddabilty versus fault rates in square lattices of complete bipartite unit cells. The studies show these algorithms are more resilient to faulty fabrics than naive embedding approaches, a feature which should prove useful in benchmarking the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm on existing faulty hardware.

Physical Review A 87, 033804 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8450  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of single photonic and atomic excitations in the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model where the cavities are arranged in an Apollonian network (AN). The existence of a gapped field normal frequency spectrum along with strongly localized eigenstates on the AN highlights many of the features provided by the model. By numerically diagonalizing the JCH Hamiltonian in the single excitation subspace, we evaluate the time evolution of fully localized initial states, for many energy regimes. We provide a detailed description of the photonic quantum walk on the AN and also address how an effective Jaynes-Cummings interaction can be achieved at the strong hopping regime. When the hopping rate and the atom-field coupling strength is of the same order, the excitation is relatively allowed to roam between atomic and photonic degrees of freedom as it propagates. However, different cavities will contribute mostly to one of these components, depending on the detuning and initial conditions, in contrast to the strong atom-field coupling regime, where atomic and photonic modes propagate identically.

<p>
The problem of bound states in delta potentials is revisited by means of Fourier transform approach. The problem in a simple delta potential sums up to solve an algebraic equation of degree one for the Fourier transform of the eigenfunction and the problem for more than one delta function also reveals itself to be a simple matter. Quite differently from direct methods, no knowledge about the jump discontinuity of the first derivative of the eigenfunction is required to determine the solution of the problem.

<p>
In this paper we analyze a free quantum particle in a straight Dirichlet waveguide which has at its axis two Dirichlet barriers of lengths $\ell_\pm$ separated by a window of length 2a. It is known that if the barriers are semiinfinite, i.e. we have two adjacent waveguides coupled laterally through the boundary window, the system has for any a>0 a finite number of eigenvalues below the essential spectrum threshold. Here we demonstrate that for large but finite $\ell_\pm$ the system has resonances which converge to the said eigenvalues as $\ell_\pm\to\infty$, and derive the leading term in the corresponding asymptotic expansion.

We describe the use of quantum process calculus to describe and analyze quantum communication protocols, following the successful field of formal methods from classical computer science. The key idea is to define two systems, one modelling a protocol and one expressing a specification, and prove that they are behaviourally equivalent. We summarize the necessary theory in the process calculus CQP, including the crucial result that equivalence is a congruence, meaning that it is preserved by embedding in any context. We illustrate the approach by analyzing two versions of a quantum error correction system.

We concjecture that our results give a universal description of chaotic scattering.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the stability of quantum Markov processes with respect to perturbations of their transition maps. In the first part, we introduce a condition number that measures the sensitivity of fixed points of a quantum channel to perturbations. We establish upper and lower bounds on this condition number in terms of subdominant eigenvalues of the transition map. In the second part, we consider quantum Markov processes that converge to a unique stationary state and we analyze the stability of the evolution at finite times. In this way we obtain a linear relation between the mixing time of a quantum Markov process and the sensitivity of its fixed point with respect to perturbations of the transition map.

<p>
This paper explores the issue of the unification of three languages of physics, the geometric language of forces, geometric language of fields or 4-dimensional space-time, and probabilistic language of quantum mechanics. On the one hand, equations in each language may be derived from the Principle of Least Action (PLA). On the other hand, Feynman's path integral method could explain the physical meaning of PLA. The axioms of classical and relativistic mechanics can be considered as consequences of Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics.

Phys. Rev. B 87, 035104 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2685  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using a similarity Hamiltonian renormalization procedure, we determine an effective spin-1/2 representation of the Bose-Hubbard model at half-integer filling and at a finite on-site interaction energy U. By means of bosonization, we are able to recast the effective Hamiltonian as that of a spin-1/2 XXZ magnetic chain with pertinently renormalized coupling and anisotropy parameters. We use this mapping to provide analytical estimates of the correlation functions of the Bose-Hubbard model. We then compare such results with those based on DMRG numerical simulations of the Bose-Hubbard model for various values of U and for a number L of lattice sites as low as L ~ 30. We find an excellent agreement up to 10% between the output of analytical and numerical computations, even for relatively small values of U. Our analysis implies that, also at finite U, the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with suitably chosen parameters may be seen as a quantum simulator of the XXZ chain.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new application of harmonic analysis to quantum information by constructing intriguing classes of quantum channels stemming from specific representations of multiplier algebras over locally compact groups $G$. Beginning with a representation of the measure algebra $M(G)$, we unify and elaborate on recent counter-examples to fixed point subalgebras in infinite dimensions, as well as present an application to the noiseless subsystems method of quantum error correction. Using a representation of the completely bounded Fourier multiplier algebra $McbA(G)$, we provide a new class of counter-examples to the recently solved asymptotic quantum Birkhoff conjecture, along with a systematic method of producing the examples using a geometric representation of Schur maps. Further properties of our channels including duality, quantum capacity, and entanglement preservation are discussed along with potential applications to additivity conjectures.

An operator equality on the entropy production for general quantum Markovian master equations is derived without resorting quantum stochastic trajectory and priori quantum definition of entropy production. We find that, the equality can be still interpreted as a consequence of time-reversal asymmetry of the nonequilibrium processes of the systems. In contrast with the classical case, however, the first order expansion of the equality does not directly related to the mean entropy production, which arises from noncommute property of operators in quantum physics.

**49.    Efficient Inner-product Algorithm for Stabilizer States**  
Hector J. Garcia, Igor L. Markov, Andrew W. Cross  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6646  
<blockquote>
<p>
Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly 4(2^n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms to compute the inner product between two such frames.

Shahpoor Saeidian, Vladimir S. Melezhik, Peter Schmelcher  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7984  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop and analyze a theoretical model which yields the shifts and widths of Feshbach resonances in an atomic waveguide. It is based on a multichannel approach for confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) and atomic transitions in the waveguides in the multimode regime. We replace in this scheme the single-channel scalar interatomic interaction by the four-channel tensorial potential modeling resonances of broad, narrow and overlapping character according to the two-channel parametrization of A.D.Lange et al. As an input the experimentally known parameters of Feshbach resonances in the absence of the waveguide are used. We calculate the shifts and widths of s-, d- and g-wave magnetic Feshbach resonances of Cs atoms emerging in harmonic waveguides as CIRs and resonant enhancement of the transmission at zeros of the free space scattering length. We have found the linear dependence of the width of the resonance on the longitudinal atomic momentum and quadratic dependence on the waiveguide width. Our model opens novel possibilities for quantitative studies of the scattering processes in ultracold atomic gases in waveguides beyond the framework of s-wave resonant scattering.

Dibyendu Roy  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 063819 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8132  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study two-photon scattering of a tightly focused weak light beam from a small atomic ensemble of two-level atoms (2LAs). This is similar to the scattering of photons from an atomic ensemble in a one-dimensional waveguide. The scaling of two-photon nonlinearity at single-photon resonance shows a non-monotonic behaviour with an increasing number of few identical 2LAs. The two-photon nonlinearity decays monotonically with an increasing number of atoms for incident photons detuned from single-photon resonance. Single-photon transport in two 2LAs is similar to that in a single V-type three-level atom (3LA). However two-photon transport in these two systems shows very different line-shapes. When single-photon transmission is zero in these systems, two transmitted photons are bunched together in a V-type 3LA, while their correlation is zero in two 2LAs. The difference in the two-photon line-shape persists for few 2LAs and 3LAs. Therefore, the two-photon scattering of a tightly focused weak light beam can be used as a probe to detect atomic level structures of different atoms with similar transition energies.
