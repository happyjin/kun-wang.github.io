**1.    N-fold Supersymmetry for a Periodic Potential**  
Hideaki Aoyama, Masatoshi Sato, Toshiaki Tanaka, Mariko Yamamoto  
Phys.Lett. B498 (2001) 117-122  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011009  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report a new type of supersymmetry, "N-fold supersymmetry", in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. Its supercharges are N-th order polynomials of momentum: It reduces to ordinary supersymmetry for N=1, but for other values of N the anticommutator of the supercharges is not the ordinary Hamiltonian, but is a polynomial of the Hamiltonian. (For this reason, the original Hamiltonian is referred to as the "Mother Hamiltonian".) This supersymmetry shares some features with the ordinary variety, the most notable of which is the non-renormalization theorem. An N-fold supersymmetry was earlier found for a quartic potential whose supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that it also holds for a periodic potential, albeit with somewhat different supercharges, whose supersymmetry is not broken.

**2.    Quantum Computation with Ballistic Electrons**  
Radu Ionicioiu, Gehan Amaratunga, Florin Udrea  
Int.J.Mod.Phys. B15, 125 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011051  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a solid state implementation of a quantum computer using ballistic single electrons as flying qubits in 1D nanowires. We show how to implement all the steps required for universal quantum computation: preparation of the initial state, measurement of the final state and a universal set of quantum gates. An important advantage of this model is the fact that we do not need ultrafast optoelectronics for gate operations. We use cold programming (or pre-programming), i.e., the gates are set before launching the electrons; all programming can be done using static electric fields only.

**3.    Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Shifted Quadratic Character Problems**  
Wim van Dam, Sean Hallgren  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011067  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the Shifted Legendre Symbol Problem and some variants along with efficient quantum algorithms to solve them. The problems and their algorithms are different from previous work on quantum computation in that they do not appear to fit into the framework of the Hidden Subgroup Problem. The classical complexity of the problem is unknown despite the various results on the irregularity of Legendre Sequences.

**4.    On the reversible extraction of classical information from a quantum source**  
Howard Barnum, Patrick Hayden, Richard Jozsa, Andreas Winter  
Proc. Roy. Soc. (Lond.) A (2001), vol 457, p2019-2039  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011072  
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a source E of pure quantum states with von Neumann entropy S. By the quantum source coding theorem, arbitrarily long strings of signals may be encoded asymptotically into S qubits/signal (the Schumacher limit) in such a way that entire strings may be recovered with arbitrarily high fidelity. Suppose that classical storage is free while quantum storage is expensive and suppose that the states of E do not fall into two or more orthogonal subspaces. We show that if E can be compressed with arbitrarily high fidelity into A qubits/signal plus any amount of auxiliary classical storage then A must still be at least as large as the Schumacher limit S of E. Thus no part of the quantum information content of E can be faithfully replaced by classical information. If the states do fall into orthogonal subspaces then A may be less than S, but only by an amount not exceeding the amount of classical information specifying the subspace for a signal from the source.

**5.    Non-Markovian homodyne-mediated feedback on a two-level atom: a quantum trajectory treatment**  
Jin Wang, H.M. Wiseman, G.J. Milburn  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011074  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum feedback can stabilize a two-level atom against decoherence (spontaneous emission), putting it into an arbitrary (specified) pure state. This requires perfect homodyne detection of the atomic emission, and instantaneous feedback. Inefficient detection was considered previously by two of us. Here we allow for a non-zero delay time $\tau$ in the feedback circuit. Because a two-level atom is a nonlinear optical system, an analytical solution is not possible. However, quantum trajectories allow a simple numerical simulation of the resulting non-Markovian process. We find the effect of the time delay to be qualitatively similar to that of inefficient detection. The solution of the non-Markovian quantum trajectory will not remain fixed, so that the time-averaged state will be mixed, not pure. In the case where one tries to stabilize the atom in the excited state, an approximate analytical solution to the quantum trajectory is possible. The result, that the purity ($P=2{\rm Tr}[\rho^{2}]-1$) of the average state is given by $P=1-4\gamma\tau$ (where $\gamma$ is the spontaneous emission rate) is found to agree very well with the numerical results.

**6.    From Completely Positive Maps to the Quantum Markovian Semigroup Master Equation**  
Daniel A. Lidar, Zsolt Bihary, K. Birgitta Whaley  
Chemical Physics 268, 35-53 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0011204  
<blockquote>
<p>
A central problem in the theory of the dynamics of open quantum systems is the derivation of a rigorous and computationally tractable master equation for the reduced system density matrix. Most generally, the evolution of an open quantum system is described by a completely positive linear map. We show how to derive a completely positive Markovian master equation (the Lindblad equation) from such a map by a coarse graining procedure. We provide a novel and explicit recipe for calculating the coefficients of the master equation, using perturbation theory in the weak-coupling limit. The only parameter external to our theory is the coarse-graining time-scale. We illustrate the method by explicitly deriving the master equation for the spin-boson model. The results are evaluated for the exactly solvable case of pure dephasing, and an excellent agreement is found within the timescale where the Markovian approximation is expected to be valid. The method can be extended in principle to include non-Markovian effects.

**7.    On Quantum Mechanics in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe**  
E.A.Tagirov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0011011  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that only in the space-times admitting a 1+3-foliation by flat Cauchy hypesurfaces (i.e., in the Bianchi I type space-times the isotropic version of which the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-times are) the canonical quantization of geodesic motion and quantum-mechanics obtained as an asymptotics of the quantum theory of scalar field lead to the same canonical commutation relations (CCR). Otherwise, the field-theoretical approach leads to a deformation of CCR (particularly, operators of coordinates do not commute), and the Principle of Correspondence is broken in a sense. Thus, the spatially flat cosmology is distinguished intrinsically in the quantum theory.
