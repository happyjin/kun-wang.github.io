**2.    Nonclassical statistics of intracavity coupled $Ï‡^{(2)}$ waveguides: the quantum optical dimer**  
M. Bache, Yu. B. Gaididei, P. L. Christiansen  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 043802 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205029  
<blockquote>
<p>
A model is proposed where two $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear waveguides are contained in a cavity suited for second-harmonic generation. The evanescent wave coupling between the waveguides is considered as weak, and the interplay between this coupling and the nonlinear interaction within the waveguides gives rise to quantum violations of the classical limit. These violations are particularly strong when two instabilities are competing, where twin-beam behavior is found as almost complete noise suppression in the difference of the fundamental intensities. Moreover, close to bistable transitions perfect twin-beam correlations are seen in the sum of the fundamental intensities, and also the self-pulsing instability as well as the transition from symmetric to asymmetric states display nonclassical twin-beam correlations of both fundamental and second-harmonic intensities. The results are based on the full quantum Langevin equations derived from the Hamiltonian and including cavity damping effects. The intensity correlations of the output fields are calculated semi-analytically using a linearized version of the Langevin equations derived through the positive-P representation. Confirmation of the analytical results are obtained by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Langevin equations derived using the truncated Wigner representation.

**3.    Solving Shift Problems and Hidden Coset Problem Using the Fourier Transform**  
Lawrence Ip  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205034  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a quantum algorithm for solving a shifted multiplicative character problem over Z/nZ and finite fields. We show that the algorithm can be interpreted as a matrix factorization or as solving a deconvolution problem and give sufficient conditions for a shift problem to be solved efficiently by our algorithm. We also show that combining the shift problem with the hidden subgroup problem results in a hidden coset problem. This naturally captures the redundancy in the shift due to the periodic structure of multiplicative characters over Z/nZ.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are expected to provide useful algorithmic tools for quantum computation. This paper introduces absorbing probability and time of quantum walks and gives both numerical simulation results and theoretical analyses on Hadamard walks on the line and symmetric walks on the hypercube from the viewpoint of absorbing probability and time.

**5.    Quantum Computing and Dynamical Quantum Models**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205059  
<blockquote>
<p>
A dynamical quantum model assigns an eigenstate to a specified observable even when no measurement is made, and gives a stochastic evolution rule for that eigenstate. Such a model yields a distribution over classical histories of a quantum state. We study what can be computed by sampling from that distribution, i.e., by examining an observer's entire history. We show that, relative to an oracle, one can solve problems in polynomial time that are intractable even for quantum computers; and can search an N-element list in order N^{1/3} steps (though not fewer).

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we study a one-dimensional quantum random walk with the Hadamard transformation which is often called the Hadamard walk. We construct the Hadamard walk using a transition matrix on probability amplitude and give some results on symmetry of probability distributions for the Hadamard walk.

**7.    Quantum Random Walks Hit Exponentially Faster**  
Julia Kempe  
Probability Theory and Related Fields, Vol. 133(2), p. 215-235 (2005), conference version in Proc. 7th RANDOM, p. 354-69, 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205083  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the hitting time of the discrete time quantum random walk on the n-bit hypercube from one corner to its opposite is polynomial in n. This gives the first exponential quantum-classical gap in the hitting time of discrete quantum random walks. We provide the framework for quantum hitting time and give two alternative definitions to set the ground for its study on general graphs. We then give an application to random routing.

**8.    Markov shift on non-commutative probability**  
Anilesh Mohari  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205086  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a class of quantum dissipative semigroup on a von-Neumann algebra which admits a normal invariant state. We investigate asymptotic behavior of the dissipative dynamics and their relation to that of the canonical Markov shift. In case the normal invariant state is also faithful, we also extend the notion of `quantum detailed balance' introduced by Frigerio-Gorini and prove that forward weak Markov process and backward weak Markov process are equivalent by an anti-unitary operator.

**9.    Retrodiction of Generalised Measurement Outcomes**  
Anthony Chefles, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205091  
<blockquote>
<p>
If a generalised measurement is performed on a quantum system and we do not know the outcome, are we able to retrodict it with a second measurement? We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for perfect retrodiction of the outcome of a known generalised measurement, given the final state, for an arbitrary initial state. From this, we deduce that, when the input and output Hilbert spaces have equal (finite) dimension, it is impossible to perfectly retrodict the outcome of any fine-grained measurement (where each POVM element corresponds to a single Kraus operator) for all initial states unless the measurement is unitarily equivalent to a projective measurement. It also enables us to show that every POVM can be realised in such a way that perfect outcome retrodiction is possible for an arbitrary initial state when the number of outcomes does not exceed the output Hilbert space dimension. We then consider the situation where the initial state is not arbitrary, though it may be entangled, and describe the conditions under which unambiguous outcome retrodiction is possible for a fine-grained generalised measurement. We find that this is possible for some state if the Kraus operators are linearly independent. This condition is also necessary when the Kraus operators are non-singular. From this, we deduce that every trace-preserving quantum operation is associated with a generalised measurement whose outcome is unambiguously retrodictable for some initial state, and also that a set of unitary operators can be unambiguously discriminated iff they are linearly independent. We then examine the issue of unambiguous outcome retrodiction without entanglement. This has important connections with the theory of locally linearly dependent and locally linearly independent operators.

**10.    A switchable controlled-NOT gate in a spin-chain NMR quantum computer**  
Atsushi Goto, Tadashi Shimizu, Kenjiro Hashi, Hideaki Kitazawa  
Physical Review A 67, 022312 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205135  
<blockquote>
<p>
A method of switching a controlled-NOT gate in a solid-stae NMR quantum computer is presented. Qubits of I=1/2 nuclear spins are placed periodically along a quantum spin chain (1-D antiferromagnet) having a singlet ground state with a finite spin gap to the lowest excited state caused by some quantum effect. Irradiation of a microwave tuned to the spin gap energy excites a packet of triplet magnons at a specific part of the chain where control and target qubits are involved. The packet switches on the Suhl-Nakamura interaction between the qubits, which serves as a controlled NOT gate. The qubit initialization is achieved by a qubit initializer consisting of semiconducting sheets attached to the spin chain, where spin polarizations created by the optical pumping method in the semiconductors are transferred to the spin chain. The scheme allows us to separate the initialization process from the computation, so that one can optimize the computation part without being restricted by the initialization scheme, which provides us with a wide selection of materials for a quantum computer.

**11.    The intensity correlation function of "blinking" quantum systems**  
Gerhard C. Hegerfeldt, Dirk Seidel  
J. Opt. B: Quantum and Semiclass. Opt. 4, 245 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205154  
<blockquote>
<p>
Explicit expressions are determined for the photon correlation function of ``blinking'' quantum systems, i.e. systems with different types of fluorescent periods. These expressions can be used for a fit to experimental data and for obtaining system parameters therefrom. For two dipole-dipole interacting $V$ systems the dependence on the dipole coupling constant is explicitly given and shown to be particularly pronounced if the strong driving is reduced. We propose to use this for an experimental verification of the dipole-dipole interaction.

**12.    Designing Optimal Quantum Detectors Via Semidefinite Programming**  
Yonina C. Eldar, Alexandre Megretski, George C. Verghese  
IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 49, pp. 1017-1012, Apr. 2003.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205178  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of designing an optimal quantum detector to minimize the probability of a detection error when distinguishing between a collection of quantum states, represented by a set of density operators. We show that the design of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal measurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program followed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard linear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time. Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of each optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the corresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is a pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one density operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state measurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.

<p>
By designing a proper unitary operator U, we synthesize NMR analogues of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states (pseudo-EPR states) using generalized Grover's algorithm on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer. Experiments also demonstrate generalized Grover's algorithm for the case in which there are multiple marked states.

**14.    On the digraph of a unitary matrix**  
Simone Severini  
SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, Volume 25, Number 1, pp. 295-300, July 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0205187  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a matrix M of size n, a digraph D on n vertices is said to be the digraph of M, when M_{ij} is different from 0 if and only if (v_{i},v_{j}) is an arc of D. We give a necessary condition, called strong quadrangularity, for a digraph to be the digraph of a unitary matrix. With the use of such a condition, we show that a line digraph, LD, is the digraph of a unitary matrix if and only if D is Eulerian. It follows that, if D is strongly connected and LD is the digraph of a unitary matrix then LD is Hamiltonian. We conclude with some elementary observations. Among the motivations of this paper are coined quantum random walks, and, more generally, discrete quantum evolution on digraphs.
