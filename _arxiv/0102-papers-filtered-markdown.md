**1.    Efficient quantum algorithms for some instances of the non-Abelian hidden subgroup problem**  
Gabor Ivanyos, Frederic Magniez, Miklos Santha  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102014  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we show that certain special cases of the hidden subgroup problem can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum algorithm. These special cases involve finding hidden normal subgroups of solvable groups and permutation groups, finding hidden subgroups of groups with small commutator subgroup and of groups admitting an elementary Abelian normal 2-subgroup of small index or with cyclic factor group.

**2.    Quantum Template Matching**  
M. Sasaki, A. Carlini, R. Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102020  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the quantum analogue of the pattern matching problem, which consists of classifying a given unknown system according to certain predefined pattern classes. We address the problem of quantum template matching in which each pattern class ${\cal C}_i$ is represented by a known quantum state $\hat g_i$ called a template state, and our task is to find a template which optimally matches a given unknown quantum state $\hat f$. We set up a precise formulation of this problem in terms of the optimal strategy for an associated quantum Bayesian inference problem. We then investigate various examples of quantum template matching for qubit systems, considering the effect of allowing a finite number of copies of the input state $\hat f$. We compare quantum optimal matching strategies and semiclassical strategies and demonstrate an entanglement assisted enhancement of performance in the general quantum optimal strategy.

**3.    Quantum teleportation of entangled coherent states**  
Xiaoguang Wang  
Phys. Rev. A, 64, 022303 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102048  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a simple scheme for the quantum teleportation of both bipartite and multipartite entangled coherent states with the successful probability 1/2. The scheme is based on only linear optical devices such as beam splitters and phase shifters, and two-mode photon number measurements. The quantum channels described by multipartite maximally entangled coherent states are readily made by the beam splitters and phase shifters.

**4.    Electron g-factor Engineering in III-V Semiconductors for Quantum Communications**  
Hideo Kosaka, Andrey A. Kiselev, Filipp A. Baron, Ki Wook Kim, Eli Yablonovitch  
Electronics Letters 37, 464 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102056  
<blockquote>
<p>
An entanglement-preserving photo-detector converts photon polarization to electron spin. Up and down spin must respond equally to oppositely polarized photons, creating a requirement for degenerate spin energies, ge=0 for electrons. We present a plot of ge-factor versus lattice constant, analogous to bandgap versus lattice constant, that can be used for g-factor engineering of III-V alloys and quantum wells

**5.    From Classical to Quantum Mechanics: "How to translate physical ideas into mathematical language"**  
H. Bergeron  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102084  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we investigate the connection between Classical and Quantum Mechanics by dividing Quantum Theory in two parts: - General Quantum Axiomatics (a system is described by a state in a Hilbert space, observables are self-adjoint operators and so on) - Quantum Mechanics properly that specifies the Hilbert space, the Heisenberg rule, the free Hamiltonian... We show that General Quantum Axiomatics (up to a supplementary "axiom of classicity") can be used as a non-standard mathematical ground to formulate all the ideas and equations of ordinary Classical Statistical Mechanics. So the question of a "true quantization" with "h" must be seen as an independent problem not directly related with quantum formalism. Moreover, this non-standard formulation of Classical Mechanics exhibits a new kind of operation with no classical counterpart: this operation is related to the "quantization process", and we show why quantization physically depends on group theory (Galileo group). This analytical procedure of quantization replaces the "correspondence principle" (or canonical quantization) and allows to map Classical Mechanics into Quantum Mechanics, giving all operators of Quantum Mechanics and Schrodinger equation. Moreover spins for particles are naturally generated, including an approximation of their interaction with magnetic fields. We find also that this approach gives a natural semi-classical formalism: some exact quantum results are obtained only using classical-like formula. So this procedure has the nice property of enlightening in a more comprehensible way both logical and analytical connection between classical and quantum pictures.

**6.    Information losses in continuous variable quantum teleportation**  
Holger F. Hofmann, Toshiki Ide, Takayoshi Kobayashi, Akira Furusawa  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 040301 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102097  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that the information losses due to the limited fidelity of continuous variable quantum teleportation are equivalent to the losses induced by a beam splitter of appropriate reflectivity.

**7.    A Linear Programming Approach to Attainable Cramér-Rao type Bounds and Randomness Condition II**  
Masahito Hayashi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102120  
<blockquote>
<p>
The author studies the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound by a linear programming approach. By this approach, he found a necessary and sufficient condition that the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound is attained by a random measurement. In a spin 1/2 system, this condition is satisfied.

**8.    Grover search with pairs of trapped ions**  
Mang Feng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102122  
<blockquote>
<p>
The desired interference required for quantum computing may be modified by the wave function oscillations for the implementation of quantum algorithms[Phys.Rev.Lett.84(2000)1615]. To diminish such detrimental effect, we propose a scheme with trapped ion-pairs being qubits and apply the scheme to the Grover search. It can be found that our scheme can not only carry out a full Grover search, but also meet the requirement for the scalable hot-ion quantum computing. Moreover, the ion-pair qubits in our scheme are more robust against the decoherence and the dissipation caused by the environment than single-particle qubits proposed before.

**9.    Proof of unconditional security of six-state quantum key distribution scheme**  
Hoi-Kwong Lo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0102138  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove the unconditional security of the standard six-state scheme for quantum key distribution (QKD). We demonstrate its unconditional security up to a bit error rate of 12.7 percents, by allowing only one-way classical communications in the error correction/privacy amplification procedure between Alice and Bob. This shows a clear advantage of the six-state scheme over another standard scheme---BB84, which has been proven to be secure up to only about 11 percents, if only one-way classical communications are allowed. Our proof technique is a generalization of that of Shor-Preskill's proof of security of BB84. We show that a advantage of the six-state scheme lies in the Alice and Bob's ability to establish rigorously from their test sample the non-trivial mutual information between the bit-flip and phase error patterns. A modified version of the degenerate quantum codes studied by DiVincenzo, Shor and Smolin is employed in our proof.

**10.    Projection Operator Approach to Langevin Equations in $φ^4$ Theory**  
T.Koide, M.Maruyama, F.Takagi  
Prog.Theor.Phys. 107 (2002) 1001-1035  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0102272  
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply the projection operator method (POM) to $\phi^4$ theory and derive both quantum and semiclassical equations of motion for the soft modes. These equations have no time-convolution integral term, in sharp contrast with other well-known results obtained using the influence functional method (IFM) and the closed time path method (CTP). However, except for the fluctuation force field terms, these equations are similar to the corresponding equations obtained using IFM with the linear harmonic approximation, which was introduced to remove the time-convolution integral. The quantum equation of motion in POM can be regarded as a kind of quantum Langevin equation in which the fluctuation force field is given in terms of the operators of the hard modes. These operators are then replaced with c-numbers using a certain procedure to obtain a semiclassical Langevin equation. It is pointed out that there are significant differences between the fluctuation force fields introduced in this paper and those introduced in IFM. The arbitrariness of the definition of the fluctuation force field in IFM is also discussed.

**11.    On a universal photonic tunnelling time**  
S. Esposito  
Phys.Rev.E64:026609,2001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102020  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider photonic tunnelling through evanescent regions and obtain general analytic expressions for the transit (phase) time $\tau$ (in the opaque barrier limit) in order to study the recently proposed ``universality'' property according to which $\tau$ is given by the reciprocal of the photon frequency. We consider different physical phenomena (corresponding to performed experiments) and show that such a property is only an approximation. In particular we find that the ``correction'' factor is a constant term for total internal reflection and quarter-wave photonic bandgap, while it is frequency-dependent in the case of undersized waveguide and distributed Bragg reflector. The comparison of our predictions with the experimental results shows quite a good agreement with observations and reveals the range of applicability of the approximated ``universality'' property.
