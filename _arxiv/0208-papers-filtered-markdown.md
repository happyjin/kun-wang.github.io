**1.    Wavefunction Collapse and Random Walk**  
Brian Collett, Philip Pearle  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208009  
<blockquote>
<p>
Wavefunction collapse models modify Schrodinger's equation so that it describes the rapid evolution of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states to one of them. This provides a phenomenological basis for a physical resolution to the so-called "measurement problem." Such models have experimentally testable differences from standard quantum theory. The most well developed such model at present is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model in which a fluctuating classical field interacts with particles to cause collapse. One "side effect" of this interaction is that the field imparts momentum to particles, causing a small blob of matter to undergo random walk. Here we explore this in order to supply predictions which could be experimentally tested. We examine the translational diffusion of a sphere and a disc, and the rotational diffusion of a disc, according to CSL. For example, we find that a disc of radius 2 cdot 10^{-5} cm and thickness 0.5 cdot 10^{-5} cm diffuses through 2 pi rad in about 70sec (this assumes the "standard" CSL parameter values). The comparable rms diffusion of standard quantum theory is smaller than this by a factor 10^-3. At the reported pressure of < 5 cdot10^{-17} Torr, achieved at 4.2^{circ} K, the mean time between air molecule collisions with the disc is approximately 45min (and the diffusion caused by photon collisons is utterly negligible). This is ample time for observation of the putative CSL diffusion over a wide range of parameters. This encourages consideration of how such an experiment may actually be performed, and the paper closes with some thoughts on this subject

**2.    Quantum Communication and Decoherence**  
Hans Aschauer, Hans J. Briegel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208014  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this contribution we will give a brief overview on the methods used to overcome decoherence in quantum communication protocols. We give an introduction to quantum error correction, entanglement purification and quantum cryptography. It is shown that entanglement purification can be used to create ``private entanglement'', which makes it a useful tool for cryptographic protocols.

**3.    Decay process accelerated by tunneling in its very early stage**  
T. Koide, F.M. Toyama  
Phys.Rev. A66 (2002) 064102  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208030  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine a fast decay process that arises in the transition period between the Gaussian and exponential decay processes in quantum decay systems. It is usually expected that the decay is decelerated by a confinement potential barrier. However, we find a case where the decay in the transition period is accelerated by tunneling through a confinement potential barrier. We show that the acceleration gives rise to an appreciable effect on the time evolution of the nonescape probability of the decay system.

**4.    Master equations for effective Hamiltonians**  
A.B. Klimov, J.L. Romero, J. Delgado, L.L. Sanchez-Soto  
J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 5, 34--39 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208038  
<blockquote>
<p>
We reelaborate on a general method for obtaining effective Hamiltonians that describe different nonlinear optical processes. The method exploits the existence of a nonlinear deformation of the su(2) algebra that arises as the dynamical symmetry of the original model. When some physical parameter (usually related to the dispersive limit) becomes small, we immediately get a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that represents correctly the dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We apply the same technique to obtain how the noise terms in the original model transform under this scheme, providing a systematic way of including damping effects in processes described in terms of effective Hamiltonians.

**5.    Design of photonic crystal microcavities for cavity QED**  
Jelena Vuckovic, Marko Loncar, Hideo Mabuchi, Axel Scherer  
Physical Review E, vol. 65, article 016608, January 2002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208101  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the optimization of optical microcavity designs based on 2D photonic crystals for the purpose of strong coupling between the cavity field and a single neutral atom trapped within a hole. We present numerical predictions for the quality factors and mode volumes of localized defect modes as a function of geometric parameters, and discuss some experimental challenges related to the coupling of a defect cavity to gas-phase atoms.

**7.    Measurement, Filtering and Control in Quantum Open Dynamical Systems**  
V.P. Belavkin  
Now published in: Rep. on Math. Phys. 45 No3 (1999) 353--420  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208108  
<blockquote>
<p>
A Markovian model for a quantum automata, i.e. an open quantum dynamical discrete-time system with input and output channels and a feedback, is described. A dynamical theory of quantum discrete-time adaptive measurements and multi-stage quantum statistical decisions is developed and applied to the optimal feedback control problem for the quantum dynamical objects. Quantum analogies of Stratonovich non-stationary filtering, and Bellman quantum dynamical programming in the discrete time are derived. A Gaussian Langevin model of the quantum one-dimensional linear Markovian dynamical system matched with a quantum linear transmission line as an input-output quantum noisy channel is studied. The optimal quantum multi-stage decision rule consisting of a classical linear optimal control strategy and the quantum optimal filtering of the noise is found. The latter contains the optimal quantum coherent measurement on the output of the line and the recursive processing by the Kalman filter. A time-continuous limit of the above model is considered, and the quantum nondemolition measurement, time-continuous filtering and the optimal dynamical programming are found in this limit. All the results are illustrated by an example of the optimal control problem for a quantum open oscillator matched to a quantum transmission line.

**8.    Absorption problems for quantum walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno, Takao Namiki, Takahiro Soshi, Aidan Sudbury  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., Vol. 36, No.1, pp.241-253 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208122  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper treats absorption problems for the one-dimensional quantum walk determined by a 2 times 2 unitary matrix U on a state space {0,1,...,N} where N is finite or infinite by using a new path integral approach based on an orthonormal basis P, Q, R and S of the vector space of complex 2 times 2 matrices. Our method studied here is a natural extension of the approach in the classical random walk.

**9.    Experimental realization of a continuous version of the Grover algorithm**  
Vladimir L. Ermakov, B. M. Fung  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208145  
<blockquote>
<p>
A continuous, analog version of the Grover algorithm is realized using NMR. The system studied is 23Na in a liquid crystal medium. The presence of quadrupolar coupling makes the spin I=3/2 nucleus a 2-qubit system. Applying a specially designed pulse sequence, the time evolution of the spin density operator is described in an interaction representation which has no external time-dependent radio-frequency fields. This approach is used to implement one instance of the continuous Grover search for the transform of a uniform state to a target state, and the implementation provides a clear physical interpretation of the algorithm. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theory.

**10.    Polarization Entangled W State using Parametric Down-Conversion**  
Takashi Yamamoto, Kiyoshi Tamaki, Masato Koashi, Nobuyuki Imoto  
Phys. Rev. A66, 064301 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208162  
<blockquote>
<p>
An experimental scheme for preparing a polarization entangled W states from four photons emitted by parametric down-conversion is proposed. We consider two different configurations and a method of improving the yield by using single photon sources. In the proposed scheme, one uses only linear optical elements and photon detectors, so that this scheme is feasible by current technologies.

**11.    A perturbative approach to non-Markovian stochastic Schr?dinger equations**  
Jay Gambetta, H. M. Wiseman  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 052105 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208169  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we present a perturbative procedure that allows one to numerically solve diffusive non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, for a wide range of memory functions. To illustrate this procedure numerical results are presented for a classically driven two level atom immersed in a environment with a simple memory function. It is observed that as the order of the perturbation is increased the numerical results for the ensembled average state $\rho_{\rm red}(t)$ approach the exact reduced state found via Imamo\=glu's enlarged system method [Phys. Rev. A. 50, 3650 (1994)].

**12.    Quantum testers for hidden group properties**  
Katalin Friedl, Frederic Magniez, Miklos Santha, Pranab Sen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208184  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct efficient or query efficient quantum property testers for two existential group properties which have exponential query complexity both for their decision problem in the quantum and for their testing problem in the classical model of computing. These are periodicity in groups and the common coset range property of two functions having identical ranges within each coset of some normal subgroup. Our periodicity tester is efficient in Abelian groups and generalizes, in several aspects, previous periodicity testers. This is achieved by introducing a technique refining the majority correction process widely used for proving robustness of algebraic properties. The periodicity tester in non-Abelian groups and the common coset range tester are query efficient.

**13.    A single photoelectron transistor for quantum optical communications**  
Hideo Kosaka, Deepak S. Rao, Hans D. Robinson, Prabhakar Bandaru, Kikuo Makita, Eli Yablonovitch  
Phys. Review B, 67 (2003) 045104  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208191  
<blockquote>
<p>
A single photoelectron can be trapped and its photoelectric charge detected by a source/drain channel in a transistor. Such a transistor photodetector can be useful for flagging the safe arrival of a photon in a quantum repeater. The electron trap can be photo-ionized and repeatedly reset for the arrival of successive individual photons. This single photoelectron transistor (SPT) operating at the lambda = 1.3 mu m tele-communication band, was demonstrated by using a windowed-gate double-quantum-well InGaAs/InAlAs/InP heterostructure that was designed to provide near-zero electron g-factor. The g-factor engineering allows selection rules that would convert a photon's polarization to an electron spin polarization. The safe arrival of the photo-electric charge would trigger the commencement of the teleportation algorithm.

**14.    The quantum to classical transition for random walks**  
Todd A. Brun, Hilary A. Carteret, Andris Ambainis  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 130602 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208195  
<blockquote>
<p>
We look at two possible routes to classical behavior for the discrete quantum random walk on the line: decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk, or the use of higher-dimensional coins to dilute the effects of interference. We use the position variance as an indicator of classical behavior, and find analytical expressions for this in the long-time limit; we see that the multicoin walk retains the ``quantum'' quadratic growth of the variance except in the limit of a new coin for every step, while the walk with decoherence exhibits ``classical'' linear growth of the variance even for weak decoherence.
