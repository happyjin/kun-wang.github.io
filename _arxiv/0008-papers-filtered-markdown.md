**1.    The Classical Limit of Quantum Mechanics and the Fejer Sum of the Fourier Series Expansion of a Classical Quantity**  
Q.H.Liu  
Journal of Physics A, 32(1999)L57-L62  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008005  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of a quantity on a quantum state, provided that the state itself gives in the classical limit a motion of a particle in a definite path, in classical limit goes over to Fourier series form of the classical quantity. In contrast to this widely accepted point of view, a rigorous calculation shows that the expectation value on such a state in classical limit exactly gives the Fej\'{e}r's arithmetic mean of the partial sums of the Fourier series.

Hans De Raedt, Anthony Hams, Kristel Michielsen, Seiji Miyashita, Keiji Saito  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008015  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study effects of the physical realization of quantum computers on their logical operation. Through simulation of physical models of quantum computer hardware, we analyse the difficulties that are encountered in programming physical implementations of quantum computers. We discuss the origin of the instabilities of quantum algorithms and explore physical mechanisms to enlarge the region(s) of stable operation.

**3.    Generalized quantum XOR-gate for quantum teleportation and state purification in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces**  
Gernot Alber, Aldo Delgado, Nicolas Gisin, Igor Jex  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008022  
<blockquote>
<p>
A generalization of the quantum XOR-gate is presented which operates in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces. Together with one-particle Fourier transforms this gate is capable of performing a variety of tasks which are important for quantum information processing in arbitrary dimensional Hilbert spaces. Among these tasks are the preparation of Bell states, quantum teleportation and quantum state purification. A physical realization of this generalized XOR-gate is proposed which is based on non-linear optical elements.

**4.    On quantum coding for ensembles of mixed states**  
Howard Barnum, Carlton M. Caves, Christopher A. Fuchs, Richard Jozsa, Benjamin W. Schumacher  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008024  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of optimal asymptotically faithful compression for ensembles of mixed quantum states. Although the optimal rate is unknown, we prove upper and lower bounds and describe a series of illustrative examples of compression of mixed states. We also discuss a classical analogue of the problem.

**5.    Experimental realization of optimal detection strategies for overcomplete states**  
Roger B. M. Clarke, Vivien M. Kendon, Anthony Chefles, Stephen M. Barnett, Erling Riis, Masahide Sasaki  
Phys. Rev. A (64) 012303, 2001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008028  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the results of generalized measurements of optical polarization designed to provide one of three or four distinct outcomes. This has allowed us to discriminate between nonorthogonal polarization states with an error probability that is close to the minimum allowed by quantum theory. Employing these optimal detection strategies on sets of three (trine) or four (tetrad) equiprobable symmetric nonorthogonal polarization states, we obtain a mutual information that exceeds the maximum value attainable using conventional (von Neumann) polarization measurements.

**6.    Encoding a qubit in an oscillator**  
Daniel Gottesman, Alexei Kitaev, John Preskill  
Phys.Rev.A64:012310,2001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008040  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error-correcting codes are constructed that embed a finite-dimensional code space in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a system described by continuous quantum variables. These codes exploit the noncommutative geometry of phase space to protect against errors that shift the values of the canonical variables q and p. In the setting of quantum optics, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed on the protected code subspace using linear optical operations, squeezing, homodyne detection, and photon counting; however, nonlinear mode coupling is required for the preparation of the encoded states. Finite-dimensional versions of these codes can be constructed that protect encoded quantum information against shifts in the amplitude or phase of a d-state system. Continuous-variable codes can be invoked to establish lower bounds on the quantum capacity of Gaussian quantum channels.

**7.    Secure quantum key distribution using squeezed states**  
Daniel Gottesman, John Preskill  
Phys.Rev. A63 (2001) 022309  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008046  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove the security of a quantum key distribution scheme based on transmission of squeezed quantum states of a harmonic oscillator. Our proof employs quantum error-correcting codes that encode a finite-dimensional quantum system in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of an oscillator, and protect against errors that shift the canonical variables p and q. If the noise in the quantum channel is weak, squeezing signal states by 2.51 dB (a squeeze factor e^r=1.34) is sufficient in principle to ensure the security of a protocol that is suitably enhanced by classical error correction and privacy amplification. Secure key distribution can be achieved over distances comparable to the attenuation length of the quantum channel.

**8.    A semidefinite program for distillable entanglement**  
Eric M. Rains  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008047  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the maximum fidelity obtained by a p.p.t. distillation protocol is given by the solution to a certain semidefinite program. This gives a number of new lower and upper bounds on p.p.t. distillable entanglement (and thus new upper bounds on 2-locally distillable entanglement). In the presence of symmetry, the semidefinite program simplifies considerably, becoming a linear program in the case of isotropic and Werner states. Using these techniques, we determine the p.p.t. distillable entanglement of asymmetric Werner states and ``maximally correlated'' states. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of semidefinite programming to quantum codes and 1-local distillation.

**9.    Quantum Algorithms for Weighing Matrices and Quadratic Residues**  
Wim van Dam  
Algorithmica, Volume 34, No. 4, pages 413-428 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008059  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we investigate how we can employ the structure of combinatorial objects like Hadamard matrices and weighing matrices to device new quantum algorithms. We show how the properties of a weighing matrix can be used to construct a problem for which the quantum query complexity is ignificantly lower than the classical one. It is pointed out that this scheme captures both Bernstein & Vazirani's inner-product protocol, as well as Grover's search algorithm. In the second part of the article we consider Paley's construction of Hadamard matrices, which relies on the properties of quadratic characters over finite fields. We design a query problem that uses the Legendre symbol chi (which indicates if an element of a finite field F_q is a quadratic residue or not). It is shown how for a shifted Legendre function f_s(i)=chi(i+s), the unknown s in F_q can be obtained exactly with only two quantum calls to f_s. This is in sharp contrast with the observation that any classical, probabilistic procedure requires more than log(q) + log((1-e)/2) queries to solve the same problem.

**10.    Universal quantum computation with two-level trapped ions**  
Andrew M. Childs, Isaac L. Chuang  
Phys. Rev. A 63, 012306 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008065  
<blockquote>
<p>
Although the initial proposal for ion trap quantum computation made use of an auxiliary internal level to perform logic between ions, this resource is not necessary in principle. Instead, one may perform such operations directly using sideband laser pulses, operating with an arbitrary (sufficiently small) Lamb-Dicke parameter. We explore the potential of this technique, showing how to perform logical operations between the internal state of an ion and the collective motional state and giving explicit constructions for a controlled-not gate between ions.

**11.    Universal simulation of Markovian quantum dynamics**  
Dave Bacon, Andrew M. Childs, Isaac L. Chuang, Julia Kempe, Debbie W. Leung, Xinlan Zhou  
Phys. Rev. A 64, 062302 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008070  
<blockquote>
<p>
Although the conditions for performing arbitrary unitary operations to simulate the dynamics of a closed quantum system are well understood, the same is not true of the more general class of quantum operations (also known as superoperators) corresponding to the dynamics of open quantum systems. We propose a framework for the generation of Markovian quantum dynamics and study the resources needed for universality. For the case of a single qubit, we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general. We also obtain preliminary results for the unital case in higher dimensions.

**12.    Resonance fluorescence in a band gap material: Direct numerical simulation of non-Markovian evolution**  
M. W. Jack, J. J. Hope  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008093  
<blockquote>
<p>
A numerical method of calculating the non-Markovian evolution of a driven atom radiating into a structured continuum is developed. The formal solution for the atomic reduced density matrix is written as a Markovian algorithm by introducing a set of additional, virtual density matrices which follow, to the level of approximation of the algorithm, all the possible trajectories of the photons in the electromagnetic field. The technique is perturbative in the sense that more virtual density matrices are required as the product of the effective memory time and the effective coupling strength become larger. The number of density matrices required is given by $3^{M}$ where $M$ is the number of timesteps per memory time. The technique is applied to the problem of a driven two-level atom radiating close to a photonic band gap and the steady-state correlation function of the atom is calculated.

**13.    Lateral projection as a possible explanation of the nontrivial boundary dependence of the Casimir force**  
G.L.Klimchitskaya, S.I.Zanette, A.O.Caride  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008102  
<blockquote>
<p>
We find the lateral projection of the Casimir force for a configuration of a sphere above a corrugated plate. This force tends to change the sphere position in the direction of a nearest corrugation maximum. The probability distribution describing different positions of a sphere above a corrugated plate is suggested which is fitted well with experimental data demonstrating the nontrivial boundary dependence of the Casimir force.

**14.    Infrared generation in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures via quantum coherence**  
A. A. Belyanin, F. Capasso, V. V. Kocharovsky, Vl. V. Kocharovsky, M. O. Scully  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008130  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new scheme for infrared generation without population inversion between subbands in quantum-well and quantum-dot lasers is presented and documented by detailed calculations. The scheme is based on the simultaneous generation at three frequencies: optical lasing at the two interband transitions which take place simultaneously, in the same active region, and serve as the coherent drive for the IR field. This mechanism for frequency down-conversion does not rely upon any ad hoc assumptions of long-lived coherences in the semiconductor active medium. And it should work efficiently at room temperature with injection current pumping. For optimized waveguide and cavity parameters, the intrinsic efficiency of the down-conversion process can reach the limiting quantum value corresponding to one infrared photon per one optical photon. Due to the parametric nature of IR generation, the proposed inversionless scheme is especially promising for long-wavelength (far- infrared) operation.

**15.    A New Expansion of the Heisenberg Equation of Motion with Projection Operator**  
T. Koide, M. Maruyama  
Prog.Theor.Phys. 104 (2000) 575-594  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0008182  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a new expansion of the Heisenberg equation of motion based on the projection operator method proposed by Shibata, Hashitsume and Shing\=u. In their projection operator method, a certain restriction is imposed on the initial state. As a result, one cannot prepare arbitrary initial states, for example a coherent state, to calculate the time development of quantum systems. In this paper, we generalize the projection operator method by relaxing this restriction. We explain our method in the case of a Hamiltonian both with and without explicit time dependence. Furthermore, we apply it to an exactly solvable model called the damped harmonic oscillator model and confirm the validity of our method.

**16.    Four-wave mixing at maximum coherence and eliminated Doppler broadening controlled with the driving fields**  
A. K. Popov, Alexander S. Bayev, Thomas F. George, Vladimir M. Shalaev  
EPJdirect D1 (2000) 1-12, http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/tocs/t0002d.htm  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0008019  
<blockquote>
<p>
New feasibity of coherent quantum control of four-wave mixing processes in a resonant Doppler-broadened medium are studied. We propose a technique which enables one to enhance the quantum efficiency of nonlinear optical conversion. At the same time, it allows one to decrease the required intensities of the fundamental beams compared to those necessary in the approach based on coherent population trapping. The major outcomes of the analysis are illustrated with numerical simulation addressed within a practical medium.
