**1.    One-dimensional quantum walks with absorbing boundaries**  
Eric Bach, Susan Coppersmith, Marcel Paz Goldschen, Robert Joynt, John Watrous  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207008  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we analyze the behavior of quantum random walks. In particular we present several new results for the absorption probabilities in systems with both one and two absorbing walls for the one-dimensional case. We compute these probabilites both by employing generating functions and by use of an eigenfunction approach. The generating function method is used to determine some simple properties of the walks we consider, but appears to have limitations. The eigenfunction approach works by relating the problem of absorption to a unitary problem that has identical dynamics inside a certain domain, and can be used to compute several additional interesting properties, such as the time dependence of absorption. The eigenfunction method has the distinct advantage that it can be extended to arbitrary dimensionality. We outline the solution of the absorption probability problem of a (d-1)-dimensional wall in a d-dimensional space.

**2.    Quantum quincunx in cavity quantum electrodynamics**  
Barry C. Sanders, Stephen D. Bartlett, Ben Tregenna, Peter L. Knight  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 042305 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207028  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the quantum quincunx, which physically demonstrates the quantum walk and is analogous to Galton's quincunx for demonstrating the random walk. In contradistinction to the theoretical studies of quantum walks over orthogonal lattice states, we introduce quantum walks over nonorthogonal lattice states (specifically, coherent states on a circle) to demonstrate that the key features of a quantum walk are observable albeit for strict parameter ranges. A quantum quincunx may be realized with current cavity quantum electrodynamics capabilities, and precise control over decoherence in such experiments allows a remarkable decrease in the position noise, or spread, with increasing decoherence.

**3.    A discrete and finite approach to past proper time**  
Wolfgang Orthuber  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207045  
<blockquote>
<p>
The function $\gamma(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ plays an important role in mathematical physics, e.g. as factor for relativistic time dilation in case of $x=\beta$ with $\beta=\frac{v}{c}$ or $\beta=\frac{pc}{E}$. Due to former considerations it is reasonable to study the power series expansion of $\gamma(x)$. Here its relationship to the binomial distribution is shown, especially the fact, that the summands of the power series correspond to the return probabilities to the starting point (local coordinates, configuration or state) of a Bernoulli random walk. So $\gamma(x)$ and with that also proper time is proportional to the sum of the return probabilities. In case of $x=1$ or $v=c$ the random walk is symmetric. Random walks with absorbing barriers are introduced in the appendix. Here essentially the basic mathematical facts are shown and references are given, most interpretation is left to the reader.

**4.    Asymptotic entanglement capacity of the Ising and anisotropic Heisenberg interactions**  
A. M. Childs, D. W. Leung, F. Verstraete, G. Vidal  
Quantum Information and Computation 3, 97 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207052  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compute the asymptotic entanglement capacity of the Ising interaction ZZ, the anisotropic Heisenberg interaction XX + YY, and more generally, any two-qubit Hamiltonian with canonical form K = a XX + b YY. We also describe an entanglement assisted classical communication protocol using the Hamiltonian K with rate equal to the asymptotic entanglement capacity.

**5.    Numerical simulation of information recovery in quantum computers**  
Pedro J. Salas, Angel L. Sanz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207068  
<blockquote>
<p>
Decoherence is the main problem to be solved before quantum computers can be built. To control decoherence, it is possible to use error correction methods, but these methods are themselves noisy quantum computation processes. In this work we study the ability of Steane's and Shor's fault-tolerant recovering methods, as well a modification of Steane's ancilla network, to correct errors in qubits. We test a way to measure correctly ancilla's fidelity for these methods, and state the possibility of carrying out an effective error correction through a noisy quantum channel, even using noisy error correction methods.

**6.    Phase-dependent interaction in a 4-level atomic configuration**  
Giovanna Morigi, Sonja Franke-Arnold, Gian-Luca Oppo  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 053409 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207087  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a four-level atomic scheme interacting with four lasers in a closed-loop configuration with a $\diamondsuit$ (diamond) geometry. We investigate the influence of the laser phases on the steady state. We show that, depending on the phases and the decay characteristic, the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including population inversion and complete depletion of an atomic state. We explain the phenomena in terms of multi-photon interference. We compare our results with the phase-dependent phenomena in the double-$\Lambda$ scheme, as studied in [Korsunsky and Kosachiov, Phys. Rev A {\bf 60}, 4996 (1999)]. This investigation may be useful for developing non-linear optical devices, and for the spectroscopy and laser-cooling of alkali-earth atoms.

**7.    Towards the Classical Communication Complexity of Entanglement Distillation Protocols with Incomplete Information**  
Andris Ambainis, Ke Yang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207090  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum entanglement distillation protocols are LOCC protocols between Alice and Bob that convert imperfect EPR pairs, or, in general, partially entangled bipartite states into perfect or near-perfect EPR pairs. The classical communication complexity of these protocols is the minimal amount of classical communication needed for the conversion. In this paper, we focus on the communication complexity of protocols that operate with incomplete information, i.e., where the inputs are mixed states and/or prepared adversarially. We study 3 models of imperfect EPR pairs. In the measure-r model, r out of n EPR pairs are measured by an adversary; in the depolarization model, Bob's share of qubits underwent a depolarization channel; in the fidelity model, the only information Alice and Bob possess is the fidelity of the shared state. For the measure-r model and the depolarization model, we prove tight and almost-tight bounds on the outcome of LOCC protocols that don't use communication. For the fidelity model, we prove a lower bound on the communication complexity that matches the upper bound given by Ambainis, Smith, and Yang [ASY02].

**8.    Observation of sub-Fourier resonances in a quantum-chaotic system**  
Pascal Szriftgiser, Jean Ringot, Dominique Delande, Jean Claude Garreau  
Physical Review Letters 89, 224101 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207097  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally show that the response of a quantum-chaotic system can display resonance lines sharper than the inverse of the excitation duration. This allows us to discriminate two neighboring frequencies with a resolution nearly 40 times better than the limit set by the Fourier inequality. Furthermore, numerical studies indicate that there is no limit, but the loss of signal, to this resolution, opening ways for the development of sub-Fourier quantum-chaotic signal processing.

**9.    Overhead and noise threshold of fault-tolerant quantum error correction**  
Andrew M. Steane  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207119  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fault tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) networks are studied by a combination of numerical and approximate analytical treatments. The probability of failure of the recovery operation is calculated for a variety of CSS codes, including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and more noise-tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries which can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various parameters. The main parameters are the gate (gamma) and memory (epsilon) failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t_m required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on the [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise gamma_0 is a function of epsilon/gamma and t_m; example values are {epsilon/gamma, t_m, gamma_0} = {1, 1, 0.001}, {0.01, 1, 0.003}, {1, 100, 0.0001}, {0.01, 100, 0.002}, assuming zero cost for information transport. This represents an order of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise, compared with previous calculations, which is made possible by recent insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process.

**10.    Universally valid reformulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on noise and disturbance in measurement**  
Masanao Ozawa  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105-(1--6) (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207121  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the noise in a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement should be no less than the limit set by Planck's constant, hbar/2, as demonstrated by Heisenberg's thought experiment using a gamma-ray microscope. Here I show that this common assumption is false: a universally valid trade-off relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument. An experimental implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.

**11.    Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Estimating Gauss Sums**  
Wim van Dam, Gadiel Seroussi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207131  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient quantum algorithm for estimating Gauss sums over finite fields and finite rings. This is a natural problem as the description of a Gauss sum can be done without reference to a black box function. With a reduction from the discrete logarithm problem to Gauss sum estimation we also give evidence that this problem is hard for classical algorithms. The workings of the quantum algorithm rely on the interaction between the additive characters of the Fourier transform and the multiplicative characters of the Gauss sum.

**12.    Quantum random walks in optical lattices**  
W. Dür, R. Raussendorf, V.M. Kendon, H.-J. Briegel  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 052319 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207137  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimental realization of discrete quantum random walks using neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices. The random walk is taking place in position space and experimental implementation with present day technology --even using existing set-ups-- seems feasible. We analyze the influence of possible imperfections in the experiment and investigate the transition from a quantum random walk to the classical random walk for increasing errors and decoherence.

**13.    Dynamical Aspects of Information Storage in Quantum-Mechanical Systems**  
Maxim Raginsky  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207162  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study information storage in noisy quantum registers and computers using the methods of statistical dynamics. We develop the concept of a strictly contractive quantum channel in order to construct mathematical models of physically realizable, i.e., nonideal, quantum registers and computers. Strictly contractive channels are simple enough, yet exhibit very interesting features, which are meaningful from the physical point of view. In particular, they allow us to incorporate the crucial assumption of finite precision of all experimentally realizable operations. Strict contractivity also helps us gain insight into the thermodynamics of noisy quantum evolutions (approach to equilibrium). Our investigation into thermodynamics focuses on the entropy-energy balance in quantum registers and computers under the influence of strictly contractive noise. Using entropy-energy methods, we are able to appraise the thermodynamical resources needed to maintain reliable operation of the computer. We also obtain estimates of the largest tolerable error rate. Finally, we explore the possibility of going beyond the standard circuit model of error correction, namely constructing quantum memory devices on the basis of interacting particle systems at low temperatures.

**14.    Controllable Frequency Entanglement via Auto-Phase-Matched Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion**  
Zachary D. Walton, Mark C. Booth, Alexander V. Sergienko, Bahaa E.A. Saleh, Malvin C. Teich  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207166  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new method for generating entangled photons with controllable frequency correlation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is presented. The method entails initiating counter-propagating SPDC in a single-mode nonlinear waveguide by pumping with a pulsed beam perpendicular to the waveguide. The method offers several advantages over other schemes, including the ability to generate frequency-correlated photon pairs regardless of the dispersion characteristics of the system. Numerical evidence demonstrates the improvement provided by this source in the special case of frequency-correlated two-photon states.

**15.    Introduction to Quantum Error Correction**  
E. Knill, R. Laflamme, A. Ashikhmin, H. Barnum, L. Viola, W.H. Zurek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207170  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this introduction we motivate and explain the ``decoding'' and ``subsystems'' view of quantum error correction. We explain how quantum noise in QIP can be described and classified, and summarize the requirements that need to be satisfied for fault tolerance. Considering the capabilities of currently available quantum technology, the requirements appear daunting. But the idea of ``subsystems'' shows that these requirements can be met in many different, and often unexpected ways.
