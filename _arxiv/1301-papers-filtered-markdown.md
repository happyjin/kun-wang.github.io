**1.    High-fidelity projective readout of a solid-state spin quantum register**  
Lucio Robledo, Lilian Childress, Hannes Bernien, Bas Hensen, Paul F. A. Alkemade, Ronald Hanson  
Nature 477, 574-578 (2011)

<blockquote>
<p>
Initialization and readout of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. If the state of a multi-qubit register can be read out in a single shot, this enables further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation, as well as direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement). While spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, thus far single-shot detection has only been achieved for isolated qubits. Here, we demonstrate preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity readout of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond at low temperature, and exploit this readout to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto and subsequently measuring the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control by demonstrating initialization, coherent manipulation, and single-shot readout in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for the first test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.

**2.    Non-Markovian probes in ultracold gases**  
Pinja Haikka, Suzanne McEndoo, Sabrina Maniscalco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0416  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed investigation of the dynamics of two physically different qubit models, dephasing under the effect of an ultracold atomic gas in a Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) state. We study the robustness of each qubit probe against environmental noise; even though the two models appear very similar at a first glance, we demonstrate that they decohere in a strikingly different way. This result holds significance for studies of reservoir engineering as well as for using the qubits as quantum probes of the ultracold gas. For each model we study whether and when, upon suitable manipulation of the BEC, the dynamics of the qubit can be described by a (non-)Markovian process and consider the the effect of thermal fluctuations on the qubit dynamics. Finally, we provide an intuitive explanation for the phenomena we observe in terms of the spectral density function of the environment.

**3.    Noise-resistant control for a spin qubit array**  
J. P. Kestner, Xin Wang, Lev S. Bishop, Edwin Barnes, S. Das Sarma  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 140502 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0826  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a systematic method of performing corrected gate operations on an array of exchange-coupled singlet-triplet qubits in the presence of both fluctuating nuclear Overhauser field gradients and charge noise. The single-qubit control sequences we present have a simple form, are relatively short, and form the building blocks of a corrected CNOT gate when also implemented on the inter-qubit exchange link. This is a key step towards enabling large-scale quantum computation in a semiconductor-based architecture by facilitating error reduction below the quantum error correction threshold for both single-qubit and multi-qubit gate operations.

**4.    Discrete time quantum walk with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a superconducting flux qubit**  
Ali ?. C. Hardal, Peng Xue, Yutaka Shikano, ?zgür E. Müstecapl\ioglu, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review A 88, 022303 (2013) [11 pages]  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1050  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a quantum-electrodynamics scheme for implementing the discrete-time, coined quantum walk with the walker corresponding to the phase degree of freedom for a quasi-magnon field realized in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The coin is realized as a superconducting flux qubit. Our scheme improves on an existing proposal for implementing quantum walks in cavity quantum electrodynamics by removing the cumbersome requirement of varying drive-pulse durations according to mean quasiparticle number. Our improvement is relevant to all indirect-coin-flip cavity quantum-electrodynamics realizations of quantum walks. Our numerical analysis shows that this scheme can realize a discrete quantum walk under realistic conditions.

**5.    Photon transport in binary photonic lattices**  
B. M. Rodríguez-Lara, H. Moya-Cessa  
Phys. Scr. 87 038116 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1376  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a review on the mathematical methods used to theoretically study classical propagation and quantum transport in arrays of coupled photonic waveguides. We focus on analysing two types of binary photonic lattices where self-energies or couplings are alternated. For didactic reasons, we split the analysis in classical propagation and quantum transport but all methods can be implemented, mutatis mutandis, in any given case. On the classical side, we use coupled mode theory and present an operator approach to Floquet-Bloch theory in order to study the propagation of a classical electromagnetic field in two particular infinite binary lattices. On the quantum side, we study the transport of photons in equivalent finite and infinite binary lattices by couple mode theory and linear algebra methods involving orthogonal polynomials. Curiously the dynamics of finite size binary lattices can be expressed as roots and functions of Fibonacci polynomials.

**6.    Derivation of Markovian master equations for spatially correlated decoherence**  
Jan Jeske, Jared H. Cole  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 052138 (2013) [8 pages]  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1381  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a general formalism to describe the effects of Markovian noise which is spatially correlated, typically decaying over some finite correlation length. For any system of interest, this formalism describes spatial correlations without the necessity to choose a particular microscopic model for the environment. We present a method of mapping the equations to Lindblad form and discuss functional forms for homogeneous spatial correlation functions. We also discuss two example microscopic models for the environment which exhibit non-trivial spatial-temporal correlation functions.

**7.    Testing Information Causality for General Quantum Communication Protocols**  
I-Ching Yu, Feng-Li Lin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1448  
<blockquote>
<p>
Information causality was proposed as a physical principle to put upper bound on the accessible information gain in a physical bi-partite communication scheme. Intuitively, the information gain cannot be larger than the amount of classical communication to avoid violation of causality. Moreover, it was shown that this bound is consistent with the Tsirelson bound for the binary quantum systems. In this paper, we test the information causality for the more general (non-binary) quantum communication schemes. In order to apply the semi-definite programming method to find the maximal information gain, we only consider the schemes in which the information gain is monotonically related to the Bell-type functions, i.e., the generalization of CHSH functions for Bell inequalities in a binary schemes. We determine these Bell-type functions by using the signal decay theorem. Our results support the proposal of information causality. We also find the maximal information gain by numerical brute-force method for the most general 2-level and 2-setting quantum communication schemes. Our results show that boundary for the information causality bound does not agree with the one for the Tsirelson bound.

**8.    Quantum interferometry with three-dimensional geometry**  
N. Spagnolo, L. Aparo, C. Vitelli, A. Crespi, R. Ramponi, R. Osellame, P. Mataloni, F. Sciarrino  
Scientific Reports 2, 862 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1577  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum interferometry uses quantum resources to improve phase estimation with respect to classical methods. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new quantum interferometric scheme based on three-dimensional waveguide devices. These can be implemented by femtosecond laser waveguide writing, recently adopted for quantum applications. In particular, multiarm interferometers include "tritter" and "quarter" as basic elements, corresponding to the generalization of a beam splitter to a 3- and 4-port splitter, respectively. By injecting Fock states in the input ports of such interferometers, fringe patterns characterized by nonclassical visibilities are expected. This enables outperforming the quantum Fisher information obtained with classical fields in phase estimation. We also discuss the possibility of achieving the simultaneous estimation of more than one optical phase. This approach is expected to open new perspectives to quantum enhanced sensing and metrology performed in integrated photonic.

**9.    Bell states generation on a III-V semiconductor chip at room temperature**  
Adeline Orieux, Andreas Eckstein, Aristide Lema?tre, Pascal Filloux, Ivan Favero, Giuseppe Leo, Thomas Coudreau, Arne Keller, Pérola Milman, Sara Ducci  
Physical Review Letters (2013) 160502  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1764  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs at room temperature and telecom wavelength in a AlGaAs semiconductor waveguide. The source is based on spontaneous parametric down conversion with a counterpropagating phase-matching scheme. The quality of the two-photon state is assessed by the reconstruction of the density matrix giving a raw fidelity to a Bell state of 0.83; a theoretical model, taking into account the experimental parameters, provides ways to understand and control the amount of entanglement. Its compatibility with electrical injection, together with the high versatility of the generated two-photon state, make this source an attractive candidate for completely integrated quantum photonics devices.

<blockquote>
<p>
Low noise single-photon sources are a critical element for quantum technologies. We present a heralded single-photon source with an extremely low level of residual background photons, by implementing low-jitter detectors and electronics and a fast custom-made pulse generator controlling an optical shutter (a LiNbO3 waveguide optical switch) on the output of the source. This source has a second-order autocorrelation g^{(2)}(0)=0.005(7), and an "Output Noise Factor" (defined as the ratio of the number of noise photons to total photons at the source output channel) of 0.25(1)%. These are the best performance characteristics reported to date.

<p>
A real-time Quantum Key Distribution System is developed in this paper. In the system, based on the feature of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), secure key extraction control and algorithm have been optimally designed to perform sifting, error correction and privacy amplification altogether in real-time. In the QKD experiment information synchronization mechanism and high-speed classic data channel are designed to ensure the steady operation of the system. Decoy state and synchronous laser light source are used in the system, while the length of optical fiber between Alice and Bob is 20 km. With photons repetition frequency of 20 MHz, the final key rate could reach 17 kbps. Smooth and robust operation is verified with 6-hour continuous test and associated with encrypted voice communication test.

**12.    Adaptive Resummation of Markovian Quantum Dynamics**  
Felix Lucas, Klaus Hornberger  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 240401 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2453  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a method for obtaining analytic approximations to the evolution of Markovian open quantum systems. It is based on resumming a generalized Dyson series in a way that ensures optimal convergence even in the absence of a small parameter. The power of this approach is demonstrated by two benchmark examples: the spatial detection of a free particle and the Landau-Zener problem in the presence of dephasing. The derived approximations are asymptotically exact and exhibit errors on the per mil level over the entire parameter range.

**13.    Non-Markovianity as a Resource for Quantum Technologies**  
Bogna Bylicka, Dariusz Chru?ciński, Sabrina Maniscalco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2585  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum technologies rely on the ability to coherently manipulate, process and transfer information, encoded in quantum states, along quantum channels. Decoherence induced by the environment introduces errors, thus setting limits on the efficiency of any quantum-enhanced protocol or device. A fundamental bound on the ability of a noisy quantum channel to transmit quantum (classical) information is given by its quantum (classical) capacity. Generally, the longer is a quantum channel the more are the introduced errors, and hence the worse is its capacity. In this Letter we show that for non-Markovian quantum channels this is not always true: surprisingly the capacity of a longer channel can be greater than the one of a shorter channel. We introduce a general theoretical framework linking non-Markovianity to the capacities of quantum channels, and demonstrate in full generality how harnessing non-Markovianity may improve the efficiency of quantum information processing and communication.

**14.    Approximation, Proof Systems, and Correlations in a Quantum World**  
Sevag Gharibian  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2632  
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis studies three topics in quantum computation and information: The approximability of quantum problems, quantum proof systems, and non-classical correlations in quantum systems. In the first area, we demonstrate a polynomial-time (classical) approximation algorithm for dense instances of the canonical QMA-complete quantum constraint satisfaction problem, the local Hamiltonian problem. In the opposite direction, we next introduce a quantum generalization of the polynomial-time hierarchy, and define problems which we prove are not only complete for the second level of this hierarchy, but are in fact hard to approximate. In the second area, we study variants of the interesting and stubbornly open question of whether a quantum proof system with multiple unentangled quantum provers is equal in expressive power to a proof system with a single quantum prover. Our results concern classes such as BellQMA(poly), and include a novel proof of perfect parallel repetition for SepQMA(m) based on cone programming duality. In the third area, we study non-classical quantum correlations beyond entanglement, often dubbed "non-classicality". Among our results are two novel schemes for quantifying non-classicality: The first proposes the new paradigm of exploiting local unitary operations to study non-classical correlations, and the second introduces a protocol through which non-classical correlations in a starting system can be "activated" into distillable entanglement with an ancilla system. An introduction to all required linear algebra and quantum mechanics is included.

**15.    Quantitative verification of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quantum non-equilibrium dynamics**  
Xiao-Ye Xu, Yong-Jian Han, Kai Sun, Jin-Shi Xu, Jian-Shun Tang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 035701 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2752  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) captures the key physics in the non-equilibrium dynamics of second-order phase transitions, and accurately predict the density of the topological defects formed in this process. However, despite much effort, the veracity of the central prediction of KZM, i.e., the scaling of the density production and the transit rate, is still an open question. Here, we performed an experiment, based on a nine-stage optical interferometer with an overall fidelity up to 0.975$\pm$0.008, that directly supports the central prediction of KZM in quantum non-equilibrium dynamics. In addition, our work has significantly upgraded the number of stages of the optical interferometer to nine with a high fidelity, this technique can also help to push forward the linear optical quantum simulation and computation.

Bassano Vacchini  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 030101(R) (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2902  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a large class of completely positive and trace preserving non-Markovian dynamical maps for an open quantum system. These maps arise from a piecewise dynamics characterized by a continuous time evolution interrupted by jumps, randomly distributed in time and described by a quantum channel. The state of the open system is shown to obey a closed evolution equation, given by a master equation with a memory kernel and a inhomogeneous term. The non-Markovianity of the obtained dynamics is explicitly assessed studying the behavior of the distinguishability of two different initial system's states with elapsing time.

Phys. Rev. A 88, 012105 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3146  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovianity of the dynamics of open quantum systems focusing on the cases of independent and common environmental interactions. We investigate the degree of non-Markovianity quantified by two distinct measures proposed by Luo, Fu and Song (LFS) and Breuer, Laine and Pillo (BLP). We show that the amount of non-Markovianity, for a single and a pair of qubits, depends on the quantum process, the proposed measure and whether the environmental interaction is collective or independent. In particular, we demonstrate that while the degree of non-Markovianity generally increases with the number of the qubits in the system for independent environments, the same behavior is not always observed for common environments. In the latter case, our analysis suggests that the amount of non-Markovianity could increase or decrease depending on the properties of the considered quantum process.

**19.    Robust control of quantum gates via sequential convex programming**  
Robert L. Kosut, Matthew D. Grace, Constantin Brif  
Phys. Rev. A, 88, 052326 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3235  
<blockquote>
<p>
Resource tradeoffs can often be established by solving an appropriate robust optimization problem for a variety of scenarios involving constraints on optimization variables and uncertainties. Using an approach based on sequential convex programming, we demonstrate that quantum gate transformations can be made substantially robust against uncertainties while simultaneously using limited resources of control amplitude and bandwidth. Achieving such a high degree of robustness requires a quantitative model that specifies the range and character of the uncertainties. Using a model of a controlled one-qubit system for illustrative simulations, we identify robust control fields for a universal gate set and explore the tradeoff between the worst-case gate fidelity and the field fluence. Our results demonstrate that, even for this simple model, there exist a rich variety of control design possibilities. In addition, we study the effect of noise represented by a stochastic uncertainty model.

**20.    An experimental proposal for revealing contextuality in almost all qutrit states**  
Jayne Thompson, Robert Pisarczyk, Pawel Kurzynski, Dagomir Kaszlikowski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3496  
<blockquote>
<p>
Contextuality is a foundational phenomenon underlying key differences between quantum theory and classical realistic descriptions of the world. Here we propose an experimental test which is capable of revealing contextuality in all qutrit systems, except the completely mixed state, provided we choose the measurement basis appropriately. The 3-level system is furnished by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of a single photon, which encompass three orthogonal modes. Projective measurements along rays in the 3-dimensional Hilbert space are made by linear optical elements and detectors which are sensitive to a single mode. We also discuss the impact of detector inefficiency and losses and review the theoretical foundations of this test.

<p>
We propose a modified metric based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and adopt it to define a rescaled version of the geometric measure of quantum discord. Such a measure is found not to suffer from the pathological dependence on state purity. Although the employed metric is still noncontractive under quantum operations, we show that the resulting indicator of quantum correlations is in agreement with other bona fide discord measures in a number of physical examples. We present a critical assessment of the requirements of reliability versus computability when approaching the task of quantifying, or measuring, general quantum correlations in a bipartite state.

<p>
We propose a simple structure for stationary non-Markovian quantum chains in the framework of collisional dynamics of open quantum systems. To this end, we modify the microscopic Markovian system--reservoir model, consider multiple collisions with each of the molecules with an overlap between the collisional time intervals. We show how the equivalent Markovian quantum chain can be constructed with the addition of satellite quantum memory to the system. We distinguish quantum from classical non-Markovianity. Moreover, we define the counts of non-Markovianity by the required number of satellite qubits and bits, respectively. As the particular measure of quantum non-Markovianity the discord of the satellite w.r.t. the system is suggested. Simplest qubit realizations are discussed, and the significance for real system--environment dynamics is also pointed out.

2013, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 46, 205301 (20pp)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4547  
<blockquote>
<p>
Coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, studied by many authors using many different techniques over the decades, are frequently used toy-models to study open quantum systems. In this manuscript, we explicitly study the simplest oscillator model -- a pair of initially decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with a spring-like coupling, where the bath oscillator is initially in a thermal-like state. In particular, we treat the completely positive and trace preserving map on the system as a quantum channel, and study the truncation of the channel by truncating its Kraus set and its output dimension. We thereby derive the truncated transition amplitudes of the corresponding truncated channel. Finally, we give a computable approximation for these truncated transition amplitudes with explicit error bounds, and perform a case study of the oscillators in the off-resonant and weakly-coupled regime numerically. We demonstrate explicitly that the substantial leakage error can be mitigated via quantum error correction.

We present a method for implementing stabilizer-based codes with encoding schemes of the operator quantum error correction paradigm, e.g., the "standard" five-qubit and CSS codes, on solid-state qubits with Ising or XY-type interactions.

Within this approach, the encoded states (ground states of the stabilizer Hamiltonian) can be prepared without measurements and preserved against both the time evolution governed by the original qubit Hamiltonian, and energy-nonconserving errors caused by the environment.

<p>
We demonstrate the relation between a global phase of the quantum gate and the layout of energy levels of its effective Hamiltonian required for implementing the gate for minimum time. By an example of the quantum Fourier transform gate for a qudit represented by a quadrupole nucleus with the spin I = 1, the effective Hamiltonians and minimum implementation times for different global phases are found. Using numerical optimal control methods, the problem of the global phase in searching for the optimal pulse shape is considered in detail for the quantum Fourier transform gate at I = 1, 3/2, 2, and 5/2. It is shown that at the constrained control time the gradient algorithms can converge to the solutions corresponding to different global phases or the same global phase with different minimum times of the gate implementation.

Phys. Rev. A 88, 043802 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5690  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the controllable generation of robust photon entanglement with a circuit cavity electromechanical system, consisting of two superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities (CPWC's) capacitively coupled by a nanoscale mechanical resonator (MR). We show that, with this electromechanical system, two-mode continuous-variable entanglement of cavity photons can be engineered deterministically either via coherent control on the dynamics of the system, or through a dissipative quantum dynamical process. The first scheme, operating in the strong coupling regime, explores the excitation of the cavity Bogoliubov modes, and is insensitive to the initial thermal noise. The second one is based on the reservoir-engineering approach, which exploits the mechanical dissipation as a useful resource to perform ground state cooling of two delocalized cavity Bogoliubov modes. The achieved amount of entanglement in both schemes is determined by the relative ratio of the effective electromechanical coupling strengths, which thus can be tuned and made much lager than that in previous studies.

<blockquote>
<p>
The weak-coupled two-level open quantum system described by non-Markovian Time-convolution-less master equation is investigated in this paper. The cut-off frequency, coupling constant and transition frequency, which impact on the system's decay rate, coherence factor and purity, are investigated. The appropriate parameters used in system simulation experiments are determined by comparing analysis results of different values of parameters for the effects of system performance. The control laws used to transfer the system states are designed on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulation experiments are implemented under the MATLAB environment. The features of the free evolution trajectory of the non-Markovian systems and the states transfer from a pure state to a desired pure state under the action of the proposed control laws are studied, respectively. By comparing the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed quantum Lyapunov control method applied to the state transfer in non-Markovian open quantum systems is verified. Meanwhile, the influences of different control parameters and cut-off frequencies on the system performance are analyzed.

This measure can be used as a supplement to BLP non-Markovianity for non-unital quantum processes. A measure on the degree of the non-unital behavior of quantum processes is also given in this paper.

We have examined the validity of the time-dependent variational approximation (TDVA) to the Gaussian wavepacket method (GWM) for quantum double-well (DW) systems, by using the quasi-exact spectral method (SM). Comparisons between results of wavefunctions, averages of position and momentum, the auto-correlation function, and an uncertainty product calculated by SM and TDVA have been made. It has been shown that a given initial Gaussian wavepacket in SM is quickly deformed at $t > 0$ where a wavepacket cannot be expressed by a {\it single} Gaussian, and that assumptions on averages of higher-order fluctuations in TDVA are not justified. These results cast some doubt on an application of TDVA to DW systems. Gaussian wavepacket dynamics in anharmonic potential systems is studied also.

<p>
A major challenge in using spins in the solid state for quantum technologies is protecting them from sources of decoherence. This can be addressed, to varying degrees, by improving material purity or isotopic composition for example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling, or even combinations of the two. However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in the context of frequency standards and atomic clocks, is the use of particular spin transitions which are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here we show that such `clock transitions' (CTs) can be observed for electron spins in the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds. We find that electron spin qubits based on CTs become less sensitive to the local magnetic environment, including the presence of 29Si nuclear spins as found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such CTs will be of additional importance for donor spins in future devices, mitigating the effects of magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces.

**32.    Statistical measurements of quantum emitters coupled to Anderson-localized modes in disordered photonic-crystal waveguides**

<blockquote>
<p>
Optical nanostructures have proven to be meritorious for tailoring the emission properties of quantum emitters. However, unavoidable fabrication imperfections may represent a nuisance. Quite remarkably, disorder offers new opportunities since light can be efficiently confined by random multiple scattering leading to Anderson localization. Here we investigate the effect of such disorder-induced cavities on the emission dynamics of single quantum dots embedded in disordered photonic-crystal waveguides. We present time-resolved measurements of both the total emission from Anderson-localized cavities and from single emitters that are coupled to the cavities. We observe both strongly inhibited and enhanced decay rates relative to the rate of spontaneous emission in a homogeneous medium. From a statistical analysis, we report an average Purcell factor of 2 in without any control on the quantum dot - cavity detuning. By spectrally tuning individual quantum dots into resonance with Anderson-localized modes, a maximum Purcell factor of 23.8 is recorded, which lies at the onset of the strong coupling regime. The presented data quantify the potential of naturally occurring Anderson-localized cavities for controlling and enhancing the light-matter interaction strength, which is of relevance not only for cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments but potentially also for efficient energy harvesting and controllable random lasing.

<blockquote>
<p>
Recently a high precision spectroscopic investigation of the EF^1\Sigma_g^+ - X^1\Sigma_g^+ system of molecular hydrogen was reported yielding information on QED and relativistic effects in a sequence of rotational quantum states in the X^1\Sigma^+_g$ ground state of the H_2 molecule [E.J. Salumbides et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 043005 (2011)]. The present paper presents a more detailed description of the methods and results. Furthermore, the paper serves as a stepping stone towards a continuation of the previous study by extending the known level structure of the EF^1\Sigma^+_g state to highly excited rovibrational levels through Doppler-free two photon spectroscopy. Based on combination differences between vibrational levels in the ground state, and between three rotational branches (O, Q and S branches) assignments of excited EF^1\Sigma^+_g levels, involving high vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, can be unambiguously made. For the higher EF^1\Sigma^+_g levels, where no combination differences are available, calculations were performed using the multi-channel quantum defect method, for a broad class of vibrational and rotational levels up to J=19. These predictions were used for assigning high-J EF-levels and are found to be accurate within 5 cm^-1.

<p>
We provide the first experimental demonstration of defect states in parity-time (PT) symmetric mesh-periodic potentials. Our results indicate that these localized modes can undergo an abrupt phase transition in spite of the fact that they remain localized in a PT-symmetric periodic environment. Even more intriguing is the possibility of observing a linearly growing radiation emission from such defects provided their eigenvalue is associated with an exceptional point that resides within the continuum part of the spectrum. Localized complex modes existing outside the band-gap regions are also reported along with their evolution dynamics.

**35.    Fluctuation theorems for non-Markovian quantum processes**  
Bruno Leggio, Anna Napoli, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Antonino Messina  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1553  
<blockquote>
<p>
Exploiting previous results on Markovian dynamics and fluctuation theorems, we study the consequences of memory effects on single realizations of nonequilibrium processes within an open system approach. The entropy production along single trajectories for forward and backward processes is obtained with the help of a recently proposed classical-like non-Markovian stochastic unravelling, which is demonstrated to lead to a correction of the standard entropic fluctuation theorem. This correction is interpreted as resulting from the interplay between the information extracted from the system through measurements and the flow of information from the environment to the open system: Due to memory effects single realizations of a dynamical process are no longer independent, and their correlations fundamentally affect the behavior of entropy fluctuations.

Phys. Rev. A 87, 053842 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1869  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically investigated the ground states of coupled arrays of cavity quantum electrodynamical (cavity QED) systems in presence of two photon modes. Within the Gutzwiller-type variational approach, we found the first-order quantum phase transition between Mott insulating and superfluid phases as well as the conventional second-order one. The first-order phase transition was found only for specific types of emitter models, and its physical origin is clarified based on the analytic arguments which are allowed in the perturbative and semiclassical limits. The first-order transition of the correlated photons is accompanied with discontinuous change in the emitter states, not only with the appearance of inter-cavity coherence in the superfluid phase. We also discuss the condition for the first-order transition to occur, which can lead to a strategy for future design of quantum optical switching devices with cavity QED arrays.

Effective spin-orbit coupling can be created in cold atom systems using atom-light interaction. We study the BECs in an optical lattice using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with spin-orbit coupling. Bloch states for the linear equation are numerically obtained, and compared with stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with nonlinear terms. Various vortex lattice states are found when the spin-orbit coupling is strong.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3634  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum pulsed second-subharmonic generation in a planar waveguide with a small periodic corrugation at the surface is studied. Back-scattering of the interacting fields on the corrugation enhances the nonlinear interaction giving larger values of squeezing. The problem of back-scattering is treated by perturbation theory, using the Fourier transform for non-dispersion propagation, and by numerical approach in the general case. Optimum spectral modes for squeezed-light generation are found using the Bloch-Messiah reduction. Improvement in squeezing and increase of numbers of generated photons are quantified for the corrugation resonating with the fundamental and second-subharmonic field. Splitting of the generated pulse by the corrugation is predicted.

<blockquote>
<p>
By means of time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations we study topological quantum pumping in a strongly interacting system. The system under consideration is described by the Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of a correlated hopping which breaks lattice inversion symmetry. This model has been predicted to support topological pumping [E. Berg, M. Levin, and E. Altman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110405 (2011)]. The pumped charge is quantized and of topological nature. We provide a detailed analysis of the finite-size-scaling behavior of the pumped charge and its deviations from the quantized value. Furthermore we also analyze the non-adiabatic corrections due to the finite frequency of the modulation. We consider two configurations: a closed ring where the time-dependence of the parameter induces a circulating current, and a finite open-ended chain where particles are dragged from one edge to the opposite edge, due to the pumping mechanism induced by the bulk.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4827  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a new framework that yields spectral bounds on norms of functions of transition maps for finite, homogeneous Markov chains. The techniques employed work for bounded semigroups, in particular for classical as well as for quantum Markov chains and they do not require additional assumptions like detailed balance, irreducibility or aperiodicity. We use the method in order to derive convergence bounds that improve significantly upon known spectral bounds. The core technical observation is that power-boundedness of transition maps of Markov chains enables a Wiener algebra functional calculus in order to upper bound any norm of any holomorphic function of the transition map. Finally, we discuss how general detailed balance conditions for quantum Markov processes lead to spectral convergence bounds.

<p>
Solitons are non-dispersive wave solutions that arise in a diverse range of nonlinear systems, stablised by a focussing or defocussing nonlinearity. First observed in shallow water, solitons have subsequently been studied in many other fields including nonlinear optics, biophysics, astrophysics, plasma and particle physics. They are characterised by well localised wavepackets that maintain their initial shape and amplitude for all time, even following collisions with other solitons. Here we report the controlled formation of bright solitary matter-waves, the 3D analog to solitons, from Bose-Einstein condensates of 85Rb and observe their propagation in an optical waveguide. These results pave the way for new experimental studies of bright solitary matterwave dynamics to elucidate the wealth of existing theoretical work and to explore an array of potential applications including novel interferometric devices, the study of short-range atom-surface potentials and the realisation of Schrodingercat states.

<p>
Atom interferometers covering macroscopic domains of space-time are a spectacular manifestation of the wave nature of matter. Due to their unique coherence properties, Bose-Einstein condensates are ideal sources for an atom interferometer in extended free fall. In this paper we report on the realization of an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer operated with a Bose-Einstein condensate in microgravity. The resulting interference pattern is similar to the one in the far-field of a double-slit and shows a linear scaling with the time the wave packets expand. We employ delta-kick cooling in order to enhance the signal and extend our atom interferometer. Our experiments demonstrate the high potential of interferometers operated with quantum gases for probing the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

**43.    Uniform Mixing and Association Schemes**  
Chris Godsil, Natalie Mullin, Aidan Roy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5889  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider continuous-time quantum walks on distance-regular graphs of small diameter. Using results about the existence of complex Hadamard matrices in association schemes, we determine which of these graphs have quantum walks that admit uniform mixing. First we apply a result due to Chan to show that the only strongly regular graphs that admit instantaneous uniform mixing are the Paley graph of order nine and certain graphs corresponding to regular symmetric Hadamard matrices with constant diagonal. Next we prove that if uniform mixing occurs on a bipartite graph X with n vertices, then n is divisible by four. We also prove that if X is bipartite and regular, then n is the sum of two integer squares. Our work on bipartite graphs implies that uniform mixing does not occur on C_{2m} for m >= 3. Using a result of Haagerup, we show that uniform mixing does not occur on C_p for any prime p such that p >= 5. In contrast to this result, we see that epsilon-uniform mixing occurs on C_p for all primes p.

<p>
By applying Grover's quantum search algorithm to the lattice algorithms of Micciancio and Voulgaris, Nguyen and Vidick, Wang et al., and Pujol and Stehl\'{e}, we obtain improved asymptotic quantum results for solving the shortest vector problem. With quantum computers we can provably find a shortest vector in time $2^{1.799n + o(n)}$, improving upon the classical time complexity of $2^{2.465n + o(n)}$ of Pujol and Stehl\'{e} and the $2^{2n + o(n)}$ of Micciancio and Voulgaris, while heuristically we expect to find a shortest vector in time $2^{0.312n + o(n)}$, improving upon the classical time complexity of $2^{0.384n + o(n)}$ of Wang et al. These quantum complexities will be an important guide for the selection of parameters for post-quantum cryptosystems based on the hardness of the shortest vector problem.

The gradient of the Casimir force between a Si-SiO${}_2$-graphene substrate and an Au-coated sphere is measured by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope operated in the frequency shift technique.

This is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of an additive theory using the Dirac model of graphene.
