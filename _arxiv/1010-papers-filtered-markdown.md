**1.    The Amplified Quantum Fourier Transform: solving the local period problem**  
David J. Cornwell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0033  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper creates and analyses a new quantum algorithm called the Amplified Quantum Fourier Transform (Amplified-QFT) for solving the following problem: The Local Period Problem: Let L = {0,1...N-1} be a set of N labels and let A be a subset of M labels of period P, i.e. a subset of the form A = {j : j = s + rP; r = 0,1...M-1} where P < sqrt(N) and M << N, and where M is assumed known. Given an oracle f : L->{0,1} which is 1 on A and 0 elsewhere, find the local period P. A separate algorithm finds the offset s. The first part of the paper defines the Amplified-QFT algorithm. The second part of the paper summarizes the main results and compares the Amplified-QFT algorithm against the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Hidden Subgroup (QHS) algorithms when solving the local period problem. It is shown that the Amplified-QFT is, on average, quadratically faster than both the QFT and QHS algorithms. The third part of the paper provides the detailed proofs of the main results, describes the method of recovering P from an observation y and describes the method for recovering the offset s.

G. S. Paraoanu  
Physical Review A 82, 023802 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0093  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe an interferometer based on fluorescent emission of radiation of two qubits in quasi-one-dimensional modes. Such a system can be readily realized with dipole emitters near conducting surface-plasmonic nanowires or with superconducting qubits coupled to coplanar waveguide transmission lines.

**3.    On limiting distributions of quantum Markov chains**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
International Journal of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 740816  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0741  
<blockquote>
<p>
In a quantum Markov chain, the temporal succession of states is modeled by the repeated action of a "bistochastic quantum operation" on the density matrix of a quantum system. Based on this conceptual framework, we derive some new results concerning the evolution of a quantum system, including its long-term behavior. Among our findings is the fact that the Ces$\grave{a}$ro limit of any quantum Markov chain always exists and equals the orthogonal projection of the initial state upon the eigenspace of the unit eigenvalue of the bistochastic quantum operation. Moreover, if the unit eigenvalue is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle, then the quantum Markov chain converges in the conventional sense to the said orthogonal projection. As a corollary, we offer a new derivation of the classic result describing limiting distributions of unitary quantum walks on finite graphs \cite{AAKV01}.

**4.    Quantum walk-based search and centrality**  
Scott D. Berry, Jingbo B. Wang  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042333 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0764  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the discrete-time quantum walk-based search for a marked vertex on a graph. By considering various structures in which not all vertices are equivalent, we investigate the relationship between the successful search probability and the position of the marked vertex, in particular its centrality. We find that the maximum value of the search probability does not necessarily increase as the marked vertex becomes more central and we investigate an interesting relationship between the frequency of the successful search probability and the centrality of the marked vertex.

**5.    Single Cs Atoms as Collisional Probes in a large Rb Magneto-Optical Trap**  
Claudia Weber, Shincy John, Nicolas Spethmann, Dieter Meschede, Artur Widera  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042722 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1087  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study cold inter-species collisions of Caesium and Rubidium in a strongly imbalanced system with single and few Cs atoms. Observation of the single atom fuorescence dynamics yields insight into light-induced loss mechanisms, while both subsystems can remain in steady-state. This significantly simplifies the analysis of the dynamics, as Cs-Cs collisions are effectively absent and the majority component remains unaffected, allowing us to extract a precise value of the Rb-Cs collision parameter. Extending our results to ground state collisions would allow to use single neutral atoms as coherent probes for larger quantum systems.

**6.    Probing the negative Wigner function of a pulsed single photon point by point**  
Kaisa Laiho, Katiuscia N. Cassemiro, David Gross, Christine Silberhorn  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 253603 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1208  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate quantum properties of pulsed light fields point by point in phase space. We probe the negative region of the Wigner function of a single photon generated by the means of waveguided parametric down-conversion. This capability is achieved by employing loss-tolerant photon-number resolving detection, allowing us to directly observe the oscillations of the photon statistics in dependence of applied displacements in phase space. Our scheme is highly mode sensitive and can reveal the single-mode character of the signal state.

**7.    Fully quantum mechanical dynamic analysis of single-photon transport in a single-mode waveguide coupled to a traveling-wave resonator**  
Edwin E. Hach III, Ali W. Elshaari, Stefan F. Preble  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1779  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the dynamics of single photon transport in a single-mode waveguide coupled to a micro-optical resonator using a fully quantum mechanical model. We examine the propagation of a single-photon Gaussian packet through the system under various coupling conditions. We review the theory of single photon transport phenomena as applied to the system and we develop a discussion on the numerical technique we used to solve for dynamical behavior of the quantized field. To demonstrate our method and to establish robust single photon results, we study the process of adiabatically lowering or raising the energy of a single photon trapped in an optical resonator under active tuning of the resonator. We show that our fully quantum mechanical approach reproduces the semi-classical result in the appropriate limit and that the adiabatic invariant has the same form in each case. Finally, we explore the trapping of a single photon in a system of dynamically tuned, coupled optical cavities.

**8.    Zeno-anti-Zeno crossover via external fields in a one-dimensional coupled-cavity waveguide**  
Lan Zhou, Le-Man Kuang  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042113 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1805  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied a hybrid system of a one-dimensional coupled-cavity waveguide with a two-level system inside, which subject to a external periodical field. Using the extended Hilbert space formalism, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is reduced into an equivalent time-independent one. Via computing the Floquet-Green's function, the Zeno-anti-Zeno crossover is controlled by the driven intensity and frequency, and the detuning between the cavity and the two-level system.

**9.    Mimicking the probability distribution of a two-dimensional Grover walk with a single-qubit coin**  
C. Di Franco, M. McGettrick, Th. Busch  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 080502 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2470  
<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-dimensional quantum walks usually require large coin spaces. Here we show that the non-localized case of the spatial density probability of the two-dimensional Grover walk can be obtained using only a two-dimensional coin space and a quantum walk in alternate directions. We present a formal proof of this correspondence and analyze the behavior of the coin-position entanglement as well as the x-y spatial entanglement in our scheme with respect to the Grover one. We show that our experimentally simpler scheme allows to entangle the two orthogonal directions of the walk more efficiently.

**10.    Quantum walks and quantum simulations with Bloch oscillating spinor atoms**  
D. Witthaut  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 033602 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2514  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for the realization of a quantum walker and a quantum simulator for the Dirac equation with ultracold spinor atoms in driven optical lattices. A precise control of the dynamics of the atomic matter wave can be realized using time-dependent external forces. If the force depends on the spin state of the atoms, the dynamics will entangle the inner and outer degrees of freedom which offers unique opportunities for quantum information and quantum simulation. Here, we introduce a method to realize a quantum walker based on the state-dependent transport of spinor atoms and a coherent driving of the internal state. In the limit of weak driving the dynamics is equivalent to that of a Dirac particle in 1+1 dimensions. Thus it becomes possible to simulate relativistic effects such as Zitterbewegung and Klein tunneling.

**11.    Gaussian flexibility with Fourier accuracy: the periodic von Neumann basis set**  
Asaf Shimshovitz, David J.Tannor  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2588  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new method for solving quantum mechanical problems, which combines the flexibility of Gaussian basis set methods with the numerical accuracy of the Fourier method. The method is based on the incorporation of periodic boundary conditions into the von Neumann basis of phase space Gaussians [F. Dimler et al., New J. Phys. 11, 105052 (2009)]. In this paper we focus on the Time-independent Schr\"odinger Equation and show results for the harmonic, Morse and Coulomb potentials that demonstrate that the periodic von Neumann method or pvN is significantly more accurate than the usual vN method. Formally, we are able to show an exact equivalence between the pvN and the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) methods. Moreover, due to the locality of the pvN functions we are able to remove Gaussian basis functions without loss of accuracy, and obtain significantly better efficiency than that of the FGH. We show that in the classical limit the method has the remarkable efficiency of 1 basis function per 1 eigenstate.

**12.    Quantum codes give counterexamples to the unique pre-image conjecture of the N-representability problem**  
Samuel A. Ocko, Xie Chen, Bei Zeng, Beni Yoshida, Zhengfeng Ji, Mary Beth Ruskai, Isaac L. Chuang  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110501 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2717  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that the ground state energy of many-particle Hamiltonians involving only 2-body interactions can be obtained using constrained optimizations over density matrices which arise from reducing an N-particle state. While determining which 2-particle density matrices are "N- representable" is a computationally hard problem, all known extreme N-representable 2-particle reduced density matrices arise from a unique N-particle pre-image, satisfying a conjecture established in 1972. We present explicit counterexamples to this conjecture through giving Hamiltonians with 2-body interactions which have degenerate ground states that cannot be distinguished by any 2-body operator. We relate the existence of such counterexamples to quantum error correction codes and topologically ordered spin systems.

**13.    Macroscopic quantum tunneling in multigap superconducting Josephson junctions: Escape rate enhancement via quantum fluctuations of Josephson-Leggett mode**  
Yukihiro Ota, Masahiko Machida, Tomio Koyama  
Phys. Rev. B 83, 060503(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2804  
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically study the macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in a hetero Josephson junction formed by a conventional single-gap superconductor and a multi-gap one such as ${MgB}_{2}$ and iron-based superconductors. In such a Josephson junction more than one phase differences are defined. We clarify the quantum dynamics of the phase differences and construct a theory for the MQT in the multi-gap Josephson junctions. The dynamics of the phase differences are strongly affected by the Josephson-Leggett mode, which is the out-of-phase oscillation mode of the phase differences. The escape rate is calculated in terms of the effective action renormalized by the Josephson-Leggett mode. It is shown that the escape rate is drastically enhanced when the frequency of the Josephson-Leggett mode is less than the Josephson-plasma frequency.

Stefano Olivares, Michal Sedlak, Peter Rapcan, Matteo G. A. Paris, Vladimir Buzek  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 012313 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2937  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for unambiguous state comparison (USC) of two unknown squeezed vacuum states of an electromagnetic field. Our setup is based on linear optical elements and photon-number detectors, and achieves optimal USC in an ideal case of unit quantum efficiency. In realistic conditions, i.e., for non-unit quantum efficiency of photodetectors, we evaluate the probability of getting an ambiguous result as well as the reliability of the scheme, thus showing its robustness in comparison to previous proposals.

**15.    5-qubit quantum error correction in a charge qubit quantum computer**  
Dave Touchette, Haleemur Ali, Michael Hilke  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3242  
<blockquote>
<p>
We implement the DiVincenzo-Shor 5 qubit quantum error correcting code into a solid-state quantum register. The quantum register is a multi charge-qubit system in a semiconductor environment, where the main sources of noise are phase decoherence and relaxation. We evaluate the decay of the density matrix for this multi-qubit system and perform regular quantum error corrections. The performance of the error correction in this realistic system is found to yield an improvement of the fidelity. The fidelity can be maintained arbitrarily close to one by sufficiently increasing the frequency of error correction. This opens the door for arbitrarily long quantum computations.

Hao-Tian Wang, Chuan-Feng Li, Yang Zou, Rong-Chun Ge, Guang-Can Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3402  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed study of the entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit system coupled to independent non-Markovian environments, employing hierarchy equations. This recently developed theoretical treatment can conveniently solve non-Markovian problems and take into consideration the correlation between the system and bath in an initial state. We concentrate on calculating the death and rebirth time points of the entanglement to obtain a general view of the concurrence curve and explore the behavior of entanglement dynamics with respect to the coupling strength, the characteristic frequency of the noise bath and the environment temperature.

<p>
We consider 2-state quantum walks (QWs) on the line, which are defined by two matrices. One of the matrices operates the walk in certain intervals. In the usual QWs starting from the origin, localization does not occur at all. However, our walk can be localized around the origin. In this paper, we present some limit distributions for the walk.

**18.    Comparison of different measures for quantum discord under non-Markovian noise**  
Zhenyu Xu, Wanli Yang, Xing Xiao, Mang Feng  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 44 (2011) 395304  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3521  
<blockquote>
<p>
Two geometric measures for quantum discord were recently proposed by Modi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 080501 (2010)] and Dakic et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 190502 (2010)]. We study the similarities and differences for total quantum correlations of Bell-diagonal states using these two geometry-based quantum discord and the original quantum discord. We show that, under non-Markovian dephasing channels, quantum discord and one of the geometric measures stay constant for a finite amount of time, but not the other geometric measure. However, all the three measures share a common sudden change point. Our study on critical point of sudden transition might be useful for keeping long time total quantum correlations under decoherence.

In this article we give a complete answer to this question through some rationality results of trigonometric functions.

**20.    Integrated photonic 3D waveguide arrays for quantum random walks on a circle**  
Trond Linjordet  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3784  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks (QRWs) can be used to perform both quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. In order to exploit this potential, quantum walks on different types of graphs must be physically implemented. To this end we design, model and experimentally fabricate, using the femtosecond laser direct-write technique, a 3D tubular waveguide array within glass to implement a photonic quantum walk on a circle. The boundary conditions of a QRW on a circle naturally suggests a 3D waveguide implementation - allowing much simpler device design than what could be achieved using a 2D waveguide architecture. We show that, in some cases, three-dimensional photonic circuits can be more suited to the simulation of complex quantum phenomena.

**21.    An iterative approach for amplitude amplification with nonorthogonal measurements**  
H. T. Ng, Franco Nori  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3995  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using three coupled harmonic oscillators, we present an amplitude-amplification method for factorization of an integer. We generalize the method in [arXiv:1007.4338] by employing non-orthogonal measurements on the harmonic oscillator. This method can increase the probability of obtaining the factors by repeatedly using the nonlinear interactions between the oscillators and non-orthogonal measurements. However, this approach requires an exponential amount of resources for implementation. Thus, this method cannot provide a speed-up over classical algorithms unless its limitations are resolved.

Neil B. Lovett, Matthew Everitt, Matthew Trevers, Daniel Mosby, Dan Stockton, Viv Kendon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4705

<p>
We study the quantum walk search algorithm of Shenvi, Kempe and Whaley [PRA 67 052307 (2003)] on data structures of one to two spatial dimensions, on which the algorithm is thought to be less efficient than in three or more spatial dimensions. Our aim is to understand why the quantum algorithm is dimension dependent whereas the best classical algorithm is not, and to show in more detail how the efficiency of the quantum algorithm varies with spatial dimension or accessibility of the data. Our numerical results agree with the expected scaling in 2D of $O(\sqrt{N \log N})$, and show how the prefactors display significant dependence on both the degree and symmetry of the graph. Specifically, we see, as expected, the prefactor of the time complexity dropping as the degree (connectivity) of the structure is increased.

**25.    Universal Markovian reduction of Brownian particle dynamics**  
Rocco Martinazzo, Bassano Vacchini, Keith H. Hughes, Irene Burghardt  
J. Chem. Phys. 134, 011101 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4718  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian processes can often be turned Markovian by enlarging the set of variables. Here we show, by an explicit construction, how this can be done for the dynamics of a Brownian particle obeying the generalized Langevin equation. Given an arbitrary bath spectral density $J_{0}$, we introduce an orthogonal transformation of the bath variables into effective modes, leading stepwise to a semi-infinite chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. The transformation is uniquely determined by $J_{0}$ and defines a sequence $\{J_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of residual spectral densities describing the interaction of the terminal chain mode, at each step, with the remaining bath. We derive a simple, one-term recurrence relation for this sequence, and show that its limit is the quasi-Ohmic expression provided by the Rubin model of dissipation. Numerical calculations show that, irrespective of the details of $J_{0}$, convergence is fast enough to be useful in practice for an effective Markovian reduction of quantum dissipative dynamics.

We develop a layered quantum computer architecture, which is a systematic framework for tackling the individual challenges of developing a quantum computer while constructing a cohesive device design. We discuss many of the prominent techniques for implementing circuit-model quantum computing and introduce several new methods, with an emphasis on employing surface code quantum error correction. In doing so, we propose a new quantum computer architecture based on optical control of quantum dots. The timescales of physical hardware operations and logical, error-corrected quantum gates differ by several orders of magnitude. By dividing functionality into layers, we can design and analyze subsystems independently, demonstrating the value of our layered architectural approach. Using this concrete hardware platform, we provide resource analysis for executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for integer factoring and quantum simulation, finding that the quantum dot architecture we study could solve such problems on the timescale of days.

Two situations - with and without intermediate time measurements of the walks are considered. At last, it is shown that the quantum walks of plane wave can be used to calculate the evolution of the general wave packets, e.g., Gaussian wave packet.

<p>
Artificial molecules containing just one or two electrons provide a powerful platform for studies of orbital and spin quantum dynamics in nanoscale devices. A well-known example of these dynamics is tunneling of electrons between two coupled quantum dots triggered by microwave irradiation. So far, these tunneling processes have been treated as electric dipole-allowed spin-conserving events. Here we report that microwaves can also excite tunneling transitions between states with different spin. In this work, the dominant mechanism responsible for violation of spin conservation is the spin-orbit interaction. These transitions make it possible to perform detailed microwave spectroscopy of the molecular spin states of an artificial hydrogen molecule and open up the possibility of realizing full quantum control of a two spin system via microwave excitation.

Quadratic discrete Fourier transform and mutually unbiased bases, G. Nikolic (Ed.) (2010) 103-138

<blockquote>
<p>
The present chapter [submitted for publication in "Fourier Transforms, Theory and Applications", G. Nikolic (Ed.), InTech (Open Access Publisher), Vienna, 2011] is concerned with the introduction and study of a quadratic discrete Fourier transform. This Fourier transform can be considered as a two-parameter extension, with a quadratic term, of the usual discrete Fourier transform. In the case where the two parameters are taken to be equal to zero, the quadratic discrete Fourier transform is nothing but the usual discrete Fourier transform. The quantum quadratic discrete Fourier transform plays an important role in the field of quantum information. In particular, such a transformation in prime dimension can be used for obtaining a complete set of mutually unbiased bases.

We present an approach to characterize genuine multiparticle entanglement using appropriate approximations in the space of quantum states. This leads to a criterion for entanglement which can easily be calculated using semidefinite programming and improves all existing approaches significantly. Experimentally, it can also be evaluated when only some observables are measured. Furthermore, it results in a computable entanglement monotone for genuine multiparticle entanglement. Based on this, we develop an analytical approach for the entanglement detection in cluster states, leading to an exponential improvement compared with existing schemes.

In both cases, we show that large values for the concurrence are attainable for qubit-qubit distances larger than the operating wavelength by using plasmonic waveguides that are currently available.
