**1.    Deterministic entanglement purification and complete nonlocal Bell-state analysis with hyperentanglement**  
Yu-Bo Sheng, Fu-Guo Deng  
Physical Review A 81, 032307 (2010).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0079  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement purification is a very important element for long-distance quantum communication. Different from all the existing entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) in which two parties can only obtain some quantum systems in a mixed entangled state with a higher fidelity probabilistically by consuming quantum resources exponentially, here we present a deterministic EPP with hyperentanglement. Using this protocl, the two parties can, in principle, obtain deterministically maximally entangled pure states in polarization without destroying any less-entangled photon pair, which will improve the efficiency of long-distance quantum communication exponentially. Meanwhile, it will be shown that this EPP can be used to complete nonlocal Bell-state analysis perfectly. We also discuss this EPP in a practical transmission.

**2.    Quantum Fisher Information Flow in Non-Markovian Processes of Open Systems**  
Xiao-Ming Lu, Xiaoguang Wang, C. P. Sun  
Physical Review A 82, 042103 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0587  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to use the quantum Fisher information in characterizing the information flow of open quantum systems. This information-theoretic approach provides a quantitative measure to statistically distinguish Markovian and non-Markovian processes. A basic relation between the QFI flow and non-Markovianity is unveiled for quantum dynamics of open systems. For a class of time-local master equations, the exactly-analytic solution shows that the non-Markovianity is characterized by additive information sub-flows in different non-Markovian channels.

**3.    Non-Markovian dynamics without using quantum trajectory**  
Chengjun Wu, Yang Li, Mingyi Zhu, Hong Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0771  
<blockquote>
<p>
Open quantum system interacting with structured environment is important and manifests non- Markovian behavior, which was conventionally studied using quantum trajectory stochastic method. In this paper, by dividing the effects of the environment into two parts, we propose a deterministic method without using quantum trajectory. This method is more efficient and accurate than stochastic method in most Markovian and non-Markovian cases. We also extend this method to the generalized Lindblad master equation.

**4.    Error Correction and Degeneracy in Surface Codes Suffering Loss**  
T. M. Stace, S. D. Barrett  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1159  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many proposals for quantum information processing are subject to detectable loss errors. In this paper, we give a detailed account of recent results in which we showed that topological quantum memories can simultaneously tolerate both loss errors and computational errors, with a graceful tradeoff between the threshold for each. We further discuss a number of subtleties that arise when implementing error correction on topological memories. We particularly focus on the role played by degeneracy in the matching algorithms, and present a systematic study its effects on thresholds. We also discuss some of the implications of degeneracy for estimating phase transition temperatures in the random bond Ising model.

**5.    Quantum Hitting Time on the Complete Graph**  
R.A.M. Santos, R. Portugal  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1217  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks play an important role in the area of quantum algorithms. Many interesting problems can be reduced to searching marked states in a quantum Markov chain. In this context, the notion of quantum hitting time is very important, because it quantifies the running time of the algorithms. Markov chain-based algorithms are probabilistic, therefore the calculation of the success probability is also required in the analysis of the computational complexity. Using Szegedy's definition of quantum hitting time, which is a natural extension of the definition of the classical hitting time, we present analytical expressions for the hitting time and success probability of the quantum walk on the complete graph.

**6.    Non-Markovian quantum dynamics: local versus non-local**  
Dariusz Chruscinski, Andrzej Kossakowski  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 070406 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1259  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze non-Markovian evolution of open quantum systems. It is shown that any dynamical map representing evolution of such a system may be described either by non-local master equation with memory kernel or equivalently by equation which is local in time. These two descriptions are complementary: if one is simple the other is quite involved, or even singular, and vice versa. The price one pays for the local approach is that the corresponding generator keeps the memory about the starting point `t_0'. This is the very essence of non-Markovianity. Interestingly, this generator might be highly singular, nevertheless, the corresponding dynamics is perfectly regular. Remarkably, singularities of generator may lead to interesting physical phenomena like revival of coherence or sudden death and revival of entanglement.

**7.    Decoherence in Search Algorithms**  
G. Abal, R. Donangelo, F.L. Marquezino, A.C. Oliveira, R. Portugal  
Proceedings of the XXIX Brazilian Computer Society Congress (SEMISH), 2009, pages 293-306  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1523  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently several quantum search algorithms based on quantum walks were proposed. Those algorithms differ from Grover's algorithm in many aspects. The goal is to find a marked vertex in a graph faster than classical algorithms. Since the implementation of those new algorithms in quantum computers or in other quantum devices is error-prone, it is important to analyze their robustness under decoherence. In this work we analyze the impact of decoherence on quantum search algorithms implemented on two-dimensional grids and on hypercubes.

**8.    Nonlocal quantum information in bipartite quantum error correction**  
Mark M. Wilde, David Fattal  
Quantum Information Processing, Volume 9, Number 5, pages 591-610, September 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2150  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to convert an arbitrary stabilizer code into a bipartite quantum code. A bipartite quantum code is one that involves two senders and one receiver. The two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources to encode quantum information with local encoding circuits. They transmit their encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted quantum information. The nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits and nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local information qubits. The technique of bipartite quantum error correction is useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in fault-tolerant quantum computation. It has application in fault-tolerant quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and exploit local encoding circuits. In particular, we derive an encoding circuit for a bipartite version of the Steane code that is local and additionally requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. We have simulated this encoding in the CNOT extended rectangle with a publicly available fault-tolerant simulation software. The result is that there is an improvement in the "pseudothreshold" with respect to the baseline Steane code, under the assumption that quantum memory errors occur less frequently than quantum gate errors.

**9.    Geometry induced potential on a 2D-section of a wormhole: catenoid**  
Rossen Dandoloff, Avadh Saxena, Bjorn Jensen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2225  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a two dimensional wormhole geometry is equivalent to a catenoid, a minimal surface. We then obtain the curvature induced geometric potential and show that the ground state with zero energy corresponds to a reflectionless potential. By introducing an appropriate coordinate system we also obtain bound states for different angular momentum channels. Our findings can be realized in suitably bent bilayer graphene sheets with a neck or in a honeycomb lattice with an array of dislocations or in nanoscale waveguides in the shape of a catenoid.

**10.    Imprinting Patterns of Neutral Atoms in an Optical Lattice using Magnetic Resonance Techniques**  
Micha? Karski, Leonid F?rster, Jai-Min Choi, Andreas Steffen, Noomen Belmechri, Wolfgang Alt, Dieter Meschede, Artur Widera  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2517  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prepare arbitrary patterns of neutral atoms in a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice with single-site precision using microwave radiation in a magnetic field gradient. We give a detailed account of the current limitations and propose methods to overcome them. Our results have direct relevance for addressing of planes, strings or single atoms in higher dimensional optical lattices for quantum information processing or quantum simulations with standard methods in current experiments. Furthermore, our findings pave the way for arbitrary single qubit control with single site resolution.

**11.    Proposed method for direct measurement of non-Markovian character of the qubits coupled to bosonic reservoirs**  
Z. Y. Xu, W. L. Yang, M. Feng  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 044105 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2879  
<blockquote>
<p>
The non-Markovianity is a recently proposed characterization of the non-Markovian behavior in an open quantum system, based on which we first present a practical idea for directly measuring the non-Markovian character of a single qubit coupled to a zero-temperature bosonic reservoir, and then extend to investigate the dynamics of two noninteracting qubits subject to two reservoirs respectively with a lower bound of non-Markovianity. Our scheme, with no need of optimization procedures and quantum state tomography, is helpful for experimental implementation.

**12.    Demonstration of a programmable source of two-photon multiqubit entangled states**  
Simone Cialdi, Davide Brivio, Matteo G. A. Paris  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 042322 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2975  
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest and demonstrate a novel source of two-photon multipartite entangled states which exploits the transverse spatial structure of spontaneous parametric downconversion together with a programmable spatial light modulator (SLM). The 1D SLM is used to perform polarization entanglement purification and to realize arbitrary phase-gates between polarization and momentum degrees of freedom of photons. We experimentally demonstrate our scheme by generating two-photon three qubit linear cluster states with high fidelity using a diode laser pump with a limited coherence time and power on the crystal as low as 2.5$mW.

**13.    Disentanglement and decoherence from classical non-Markovian noise: Random telegraph noise**  
Dong Zhou, Alex Lang, Robert Joynt  
Quant. Info. Processing 9, 727 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3313  
<blockquote>
<p>
We calculate the two-qubit disentanglement due to classical random telegraph noise using the quasi-Hamiltonian method. This allows us to obtain analytical results even for strong coupling and mixed noise, important when the qubits have tunable working point. We determine when entanglement sudden death and revival occur as functions of qubit working point, noise coupling strength and initial state entanglement. For extended Werner states, we show that the concurrence is related to the difference of two functions: one is related to dephasing and the other longitudinal relaxation. A physical intepretation based on the generalized Bloch vector is given: revival only occurs for strongly-coupled noise and comes from the angular motion of the vector.

**14.    Breaking and making quantum money: toward a new quantum cryptographic protocol**  
Andrew Lutomirski, Scott Aaronson, Edward Farhi, David Gosset, Avinatan Hassidim, Jonathan Kelner, Peter Shor  
Innovations in Computer Science - ICS 2010, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, January 5-7, 2010. Proceedings, 20-31, 978-7-302-21752-7 Tsinghua University Press  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3825  
<blockquote>
<p>
Public-key quantum money is a cryptographic protocol in which a bank can create quantum states which anyone can verify but no one except possibly the bank can clone or forge. There are no secure public-key quantum money schemes in the literature; as we show in this paper, the only previously published scheme [1] is insecure. We introduce a category of quantum money protocols which we call collision-free. For these protocols, even the bank cannot prepare multiple identical-looking pieces of quantum money. We present a blueprint for how such a protocol might work as well as a concrete example which we believe may be insecure.

**15.    Steady-State Two Atom Entanglement in a Pumped Cavity Enhanced by Nonlinear Mirrors**  
Hideomi Nihira, C. R. Stroud Jr  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3939  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the steady-state entanglement of two two-level atoms inside a pumped cavity with photon leakage through a nonlinear mirror and through spontaneous decay, and show that the entanglement is enhanced by the presence of a nonlinear mirror. Our model assumes the vacuum Rabi splitting of the dressed states of the system to be much larger than any of the decay parameters of the system. We also discuss how the dressed states of the system offer us intuition as to where the entanglement lies in the state space spanned by the system, and allow us the optimize the system.

**16.    Efficient generation of highly squeezed light and second harmonic wave with periodically poled MgO:LiNbO_3**  
Genta Masada, Tsuyoshi Suzudo, Yasuhiro Satoh, Hideki Ishizuki, Takunori Taira, Akira Furusawa  
Optics Express, Vol. 18 Issue 12, pp.13114-13121 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4076  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on effective generation of continuous-wave squeezed light and second harmonics with a periodically poled MgO:LiNbO$_{\mathrm{3}}$ (PPMgLN) crystal which enables us to utilize the large nonlinear optical coefficient $d_{\mathrm{33}}$. We achieved the squeezing level of $-7.60 \pm 0.15$dB at 860 nm by utilizing a subthreshol optical parametric oscillator with a PPMgLN crystal. We also generated 400 mW of second harmonics at 430 nm from 570 mW of fundamental waves with 70% of conversion efficiency by using a PPMgLN crystal inside an external cavity.

Norio Konno  
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Vol.20, pp.1091-1098 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4678  
<blockquote>
<p>
Polya showed in his 1921 paper that the generating function of the return probability for a two-dimensional random walk can be written in terms of an elliptic integral. In this paper we present a similar expression for a one-dimensional quantum walk.

**18.    High-visibilty two-photon interference at a telecom wavelength using picosecond regime separated sources**  
P. Aboussouan, O. Alibart, D. B. Ostrowsky, P. Baldi, S. Tanzilli  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 021801(R) (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5312  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a two-photon interference experiment in a quantum relay configuration using two picosecond regime PPLN waveguide based sources emitting paired photons at 1550 nm. The results show that the picosecond regime associated with a guided-wave scheme should have important repercussions for quantum relay implementations in real conditions, essential for improving both the working distance and the efficiency of quantum cryptography and networking systems. In contrast to already reported regimes, namely femtosecond and CW, it allows achieving a 99% net visibility two-photon interference while maintaining a high effective photon pair rate using only standard telecom components and detectors.

**19.    Pulsed Nuclear Pumping and Spin Diffusion in a Single Charged Quantum Dot**  
Thaddeus D. Ladd, David Press, Kristiaan De Greve, Peter L. McMahon, Benedikt Friess, Christian Schneider, Martin Kamp, Sven Hoefling, Alfred Forchel, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 107401 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5401  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the observation of a feedback process between the nuclear spins in a single charged quantum dot and its trion transition, driven by a periodic sequence of optical pulses. The pulse sequence intersperses off-resonant ultrafast pulses for coherent electron-spin rotation and resonant narrow-band optical pumping. The feedback manifests as a hysteretic triangle-like pattern in the free-induction-decay of the single spin. We present a simple, quasi-analytic numerical model to describe this observation, indicating that the feedback process results from the countering effects of optical nuclear pumping and nuclear spin-diffusion inside the quantum dot. This effect allows dynamic tuning of the electron Larmor frequency to a value determined by the pulse timing, potentially allowing more complex coherent control operations.

**20.    Continuous-time quantum walk on integer lattices and homogeneous trees**  
Vladislav Kargin  
Journal of Statistical Physics, 2010, v. 140, 393-408  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0232  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper is concerned with the continuous-time quantum walk on Z, Z^d, and infinite homogeneous trees. By using the generating function method, we compute the limit of the average probability distribution for the general isotropic walk on Z, and for nearest-neighbor walks on Z^d and infinite homogeneous trees. In addition, we compute the asymptotic approximation for the probability of the return to zero at time t in all these cases.

**21.    Polariton crystallization in driven arrays of lossy nonlinear resonators**  
Michael J. Hartmann  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 113601 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3612  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the steady states of a lossy array of nonlinear optical resonators that are driven by lasers and interact via mutual photon tunneling. For weak nonlinearities, we find two-mode squeezing of polaritons in modes whose quasi-momenta match the relative phases of the laser drives. For strong nonlinearities the spatial polariton density-density correlations indicate that the polaritons crystallize and are predominantly found at a specific distance from each other despite being injected by a coherent light source and damped by the environment.

**22.    Casimir densities for a boundary in Robertson-Walker spacetime**  
A. A. Saharian, M. R. Setare  
Phys.Lett.B687:253-257,2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5139  
<blockquote>
<p>
For scalar and electromagnetic fields we evaluate the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor induced by a curved boundary in the Robertson--Walker spacetime with negative spatial curvature. In order to generate the vacuum densities we use the conformal relation between the Robertson-Walker and Rindler spacetimes and the corresponding results for a plate moving by uniform proper acceleration through the Fulling--Rindler vacuum. For the general case of the scale factor the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is presented as the sum of the boundary free and boundary induced parts.
