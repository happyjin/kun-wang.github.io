**1.    Quantum Dynamical Effects as a Singular Perturbation for Observables in Open Quasi-Classical Nonlinear Mesoscopic Systems**  
Gennady P. Berman, Fausto Borgonovi, Diego A.R. Dalvit  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604024  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review our results on a mathematical dynamical theory for observables for open many-body quantum nonlinear bosonic systems for a very general class of Hamiltonians. We show that non-quadratic (nonlinear) terms in a Hamiltonian provide a singular "quantum" perturbation for observables in some "mesoscopic" region of parameters. In particular, quantum effects result in secular terms in the dynamical evolution, that grow in time. We argue that even for open quantum nonlinear systems in the deep quasi-classical region, these quantum effects can survive after decoherence and relaxation processes take place. We demonstrate that these quantum effects in open quantum systems can be observed, for example, in the frequency Fourier spectrum of the dynamical observables, or in the corresponding spectral density of noise. Estimates are presented for Bose-Einstein condensates, low temperature mechanical resonators, and nonlinear optical systems prepared in large amplitude coherent states. In particular, we show that for Bose-Einstein condensate systems the characteristic time of deviation of quantum dynamics for observables from the corresponding classical dynamics coincides with the characteristic time-scale of the well-known quantum nonlinear effect of phase diffusion.

**2.    Postponement of dark-count effects in practical quantum key-distribution by two-way post-processing**  
Aeysha Khalique, Georgios M. Nikolopoulos, Gernot Alber  
Eur. Phys. J. D vol. 40, 453-464 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604025  
<blockquote>
<p>
The influence of imperfections on achievable secret-key generation rates of quantum key distribution protocols is investigated. As examples of relevant imperfections, we consider tagging of Alice's qubits and dark counts at Bob's detectors, while we focus on a powerful eavesdropping strategy which takes full advantage of tagged signals. It is demonstrated that error correction and privacy amplification based on a combination of a two-way classical communication protocol and asymmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes may significantly postpone the disastrous influence of dark counts. As a result, the distances are increased considerably over which a secret key can be distributed in optical fibres reliably. Results are presented for the four-state, the six-state, and the decoy-state protocols.

**3.    Non-Markovian thermalization of entangled qubits**  
Ian Glendinning, Matthias Jakob, Michael Noelle  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604030  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the decoherence properties of an entangled bipartite qubit system, represented by two two-level atoms that are individually coupled to non-Markovian reservoirs. This coupling ensures that the dynamical equations of the atoms can be treated independently. The non-Markovian reservoirs are described by a model which leads to an exact non-Markovian master equation of the Nakajima-Zwanzig form [J. Salo, S. M. Barnett, and S. Stenholm, Optics Commun. 259, 772 (2006)]. We consider the evolution of the entanglement of a two-atom state that is initially completely entangled, quantified by its concurrence. Collapses and revivals in the concurrence, induced by the memory effects of the reservoir, govern the dynamics of the entangled quantum system. These collapses and revivals in the concurrence are a strong manifestation of the non-Markovian reservoir.

**4.    Quantum Versus Classical Proofs and Advice**  
Scott Aaronson, Greg Kuperberg  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604056  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper studies whether quantum proofs are more powerful than classical proofs, or in complexity terms, whether QMA=QCMA. We prove three results about this question. First, we give a "quantum oracle separation" between QMA and QCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs order sqrt(2^n/(m+1)) queries to find an n-qubit "marked state" |psi>, even if given an m-bit classical description of |psi> together with a quantum black box that recognizes |psi>. Second, we give an explicit QCMA protocol that nearly achieves this lower bound. Third, we show that, in the one previously-known case where quantum proofs seemed to provide an exponential advantage, classical proofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even with no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the group oracle. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical oracles, and about the possibility of a classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA.

**5.    Speed and entropy of an interacting continuous time quantum walk**  
Diego de Falco, Dario Tamascelli  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) 5873-5895  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604067  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present some dynamic and entropic considerations about the evolution of a continuous time quantum walk implementing the clock of an autonomous machine. On a simple model, we study in quite explicit terms the Lindblad evolution of the clocked subsystem, relating the evolution of its entropy to the spreading of the wave packet of the clock. We explore possible ways of reducing the generation of entropy in the clocked subsystem, as it amounts to a deficit in the probability of finding the target state of the computation. We are thus lead to examine the benefits of abandoning some classical prejudice about how a clocking mechanism should operate.

**6.    Survival probability of surface excitations in a 2d lattice: non-Markovian effects and Survival Collapse**  
E. Rufeil Fiori, H. M. Pastawski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604069  
<blockquote>
<p>
The evolution of a surface excitation in a two dimentional model is analyzed. I) It starts quadratically up to a spreading time t_{S}. II) It follows an exponential behavior governed by a self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule. III) At longer times, the exponential is overrun by an inverse power law describing return processes governed by quantum diffusion. At this last transition time t_{R} a survival collapse becomes possible, bringing the survival probability down by several orders of magnitude. We identify this strongly destructive interference as an antiresonance in the time domain.

**7.    Nonlinear optical Galton board**  
C. Navarrete-Benlloch, A. Perez, Eugenio Roldan  
Physical Review A 75, 062333 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604084  
<blockquote>
<p>
We generalize the concept of optical Galton board (OGB), first proposed by Bouwmeester et al. {[}Phys. Rev. A \textbf{61}, 013410 (2000)], by introducing the possibility of nonlinear self--phase modulation on the wavefunction during the walker evolution. If the original Galton board illustrates classical diffusion, the OGB, which can be understood as a grid of Landau--Zener crossings, illustrates the influence of interference on diffusion, and is closely connected with the quantum walk. Our nonlinear generalization of the OGB shows new phenomena, the most striking of which is the formation of non-dispersive pulses in the field distribution (soliton--like structures). These exhibit a variety of dynamical behaviors, including ballistic motion, dynamical localization, non--elastic collisions and chaotic behavior, in the sense that the dynamics is very sensitive to the nonlinearity strength.

**8.    A novel interferometer to beat the standard quantum limit using optical transverse modes in multimode waveguide**  
Jian Fu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604103  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel interferometer by using optical transverse modes in multimode waveguide that can beat the standard quantum limit. In the scheme, the classical simulation of $N$-partical quantum entangled states is generated by using $N$ independent classical fields and linear optical elements. Similar to the quantum-enhanced measurements, the classical simulation can also achieve $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement over the precision of the measurement $N$ times for independent fields. Due to only using classical fields and linear optical elements, the scheme can be realized much more easily.

**9.    Quantum random walk of two photons in separable and entangled state**  
P. K. Pathak, G. S. Agarwal  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 032351 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604138  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss quantum random walk of two photons using linear optical elements. We analyze the quantum random walk using photons in a variety of quantum states including entangled states. We find that for photons initially in separable Fock states, the final state is entangled. For polarization entangled photons produced by type II downconverter, we calculate the joint probability of detecting two photons at a given site. We show the remarkable dependence of the two photon detection probability on the quantum nature of the state. In order to understand the quantum random walk, we present exact analytical results for small number of steps like five. We present in details numerical results for a number of cases and supplement the numerical results with asymptotic analytical results.

**10.    Momentum Dynamics of One Dimensional Quantum Walks**  
Ian Fuss, Langord B. White, Peter J. Sherman, Sanjeev Naguleswaran  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604197  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive the momentum space dynamic equations and state functions for one dimensional quantum walks by using linear systems and Lie group theory. The momentum space provides an analytic capability similar to that contributed by the z transform in discrete systems theory. The state functions at each time step are expressed as a simple sum of three Chebyshev polynomials. The functions provide an analytic expression for the development of the walks with time.

<blockquote>
<p>
Properties of the Jacobi Theta3-function and its derivatives under discrete Fourier transforms are investigated, and several interesting results are obtained. The role of modulo N equivalence classes in the theory of Theta-functions is stressed. An important conjecture is studied.

**12.    Talbot effect in cylindrical waveguides**  
L. Praxmeyer, K. Wodkiewicz  
Optics Communications, 268, 215-225, (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0604057  
<blockquote>
<p>
We extend the theory of Talbot revivals for planar or rectangular geometry to the case of cylindrical waveguides. We derive a list of conditions that are necessary to obtain revivals in cylindrical waveguides. A phase space approach based on the Wigner and the Kirkwood-Rihaczek functions provides a pictorial representation of TM modes interference associated with the Talbot effect.
