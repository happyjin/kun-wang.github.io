**1.    Transient unidirectional energy flow and diode-like phenomenon induced by non-Markovian environments**  
Jun Jing, Dvira Segal, Baowen Li, Lian-Ao Wu  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00816  
<blockquote>
<p>
Relying on an exact time evolution scheme, we identify a novel transient energy transfer phe- nomenon in an exactly-solvable quantum microscopic model consisting of a three-level system coupled to two non-Markovian zero-temperature bosonic baths through two separable quantum channels. The dynamics of this model can be solved exactly using the quantum-state-diffusion equation formalism, demonstrating finite intervals of unidirectional energy flow across the system, typically, from the non-Markovian environment towards the more Markovian bath. Furthermore, when introducing a spatial asymmetry into the system, an analogue of the rectification effect is realized. In the long time limit, the dynamics arrives at a stationary state and the effects recede. Understanding temporal characteristics of directional energy flow will aid in designing microscopic energy transfer devices.

**2.    Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in an asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler**  
Kishore Thapliyal, Anirban Pathak  
Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9654 (2015) 96541F  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00834  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in an asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler are studied. The asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler is composed of a linear waveguide ($\chi^{\left(1\right)}$) and a nonlinear waveguide ($\chi^{\left(2\right)}$) interacting with each other through the evanescent waves. The nonlinear waveguide has quadratic nonlinearity and it operates under second harmonic generation. A completely quantum mechanical description is used to describe the system. The closed form analytic solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for the different field modes are obtained using Sen-Mandal perturbative approach. In the coupler, the linear waveguide acts as a probe on the system (nonlinear waveguide). The effect of the presence of the probe (linear waveguide) on the photon statistics of the second harmonic mode of the system is considered as quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. Further,it is also shown that in the stimulated case, it is easy to switch between quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects just by controlling the phase of the second harmonic mode of the asymmetric coupler

**3.    Quantum entanglement in coupled lossy waveguides using SU(2) and SU(1,1) Thermo-algebras**  
M. Naveen Kumar, K. V. S. Shiv Chaitanya, Bindu A. Bambah  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.01539  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, the master equation for the coupled lossy waveguides is solved using the thermofield dynamics(TFD) formalism. This formalism allows the use of the underlying symmetry algebras SU(2) and SU(1,1), associated with the Hamiltonian of the coupled lossy waveguides,to compute entanglement and decoherence as a function of time for various input states such as NOON states and thermal states.

**4.    The Physics and the Computational Complexity of Multiboson Correlation Interference**  
Simon Laibacher, Vincenzo Tamma  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.01541  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate how the physics of multiboson correlation interference leads to the computational complexity of linear optics interferometers based on correlation measurements in the inner degrees of freedom of the input bosons. In particular, we address the task of MultiBoson Correlation Sampling (MBCS) from the probability distribution associated with polarization- and time-resolved detections at the output of random linear optical networks. We show that the MBCS problem is hard to solve classically even for input photons of different colors. These results manifest the quantum computational supremacy inherent to the fundamental nature of quantum interference.

**5.    Dynamical moments reveal a topological quantum transition in a photonic quantum walk**  
Filippo Cardano, Maria Maffei, Francesco Massa, Bruno Piccirillo, Corrado de Lisio, Giulio De Filippis, Vittorio Cataudella, Enrico Santamato, Lorenzo Marrucci  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.01785  
<blockquote>
<p>
Many phenomena in solid-state physics can be understood in terms of their topological properties. Recently, controlled protocols of quantum walks are proving to be effective simulators of such phenomena. Here we report the realization of a photonic quantum walk showing both the trivial and the non-trivial topologies associated with chiral symmetry in one-dimensional periodic systems, as in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. We find that the probability distribution moments of the walker position after many steps behave differently in the two topological phases and can be used as direct indicators of the quantum transition: while varying a control parameter, these moments exhibit a slope discontinuity at the transition point, and remain constant in the non-trivial phase. Extending this approach to higher dimensions, different topological classes, and other typologies of quantum phases may offer new general instruments for investigating quantum transitions in such complex systems.

**6.    Witnessing non-Markovian dynamics with the divisibility criterion: a qubit interacting with an Ising model environment**  
Fernando Iemini, Andre T. Cesário, Reinaldo O. Vianna  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02267  
<blockquote>
<p>
By means of the divisibility criterion, i.e., the non-positivity of the dynamical matrix for some intermediate time, we characterize the dynamics of a qubit interacting with an arbitrary quadratic fermionic environment. We obtain an analytical expression for the Kraus decomposition of the quantum map, and check its non-positivity with a simple function. With an efficient sufficient criterion to map the non-Markovian regions of the dynamics, we analyze the particular case of an environment described by the Ising Hamiltonian with a transverse field.

**7.    Spectrally resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent sources**  
Rui-Bo Jin, Thomas Gerrits, Mikio Fujiwara, Ryota Wakabayashi, Taro Yamashita, Shigehito Miki, Hirotaka Terai, Ryosuke Shimizu, Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02424  
<blockquote>
<p>
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between independent photon sources (HOMI-IPS) is the fundamental block for quantum information processing, such as quantum gate, Shor's algorithm, Boson sampling, etc. All the previous HOMI-IPS experiments were carried out in time-domain, however, the spectral information during the interference was lost, due to technical difficulties. Here, we investigate the HOMI-IPS in spectral domain using the recently developed fast fiber spectrometer, and demonstrate the spectral distribution during the HOM interference between two heralded single-photon sources, and two thermal sources. This experiment can not only deepen our understanding of HOMI-IPS in the spectral domain, but also be utilized to improve the visibility by post-processing spectral filtering.

**8.    The transition from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics for generic environments**  
Nephtalí Garrido, Thomas Gorin, Carlos Pineda  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02529  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using random matrices, we study the reduced dynamics of a two level system interacting with a generic environment. In the weak coupling limit, the result can be obtained directly from known results for purity decay, and result in Markovian dynamics. We then focus on the case of strong coupling, when the dynamics is known to be non-Markovian. In this regime, the coupling dominates over the local parts of the Hamiltonian, and thus we treat the latter as a perturbation of the former. With the help of the linear response approximation, this allows us to obtain an analytical description of the reduced dynamics. Finally, we find a transition from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics at a point where the coupling and the local Hamiltonian are comparable in size.

**9.    Quantum Annealing Correction with Minor Embedding**  
Walter Vinci, Tameem Albash, Gerardo Paz-Silva, Itay Hen, Daniel A. Lidar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02658  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum annealing provides a promising route for the development of quantum optimization devices, but the usefulness of such devices will be limited in part by the range of implementable problems as dictated by hardware constraints. To overcome constraints imposed by restricted connectivity between qubits, a larger set of interactions can be approximated using minor embedding techniques whereby several physical qubits are used to represent a single logical qubit. However, minor embedding introduces new types of errors due to its approximate nature. We introduce and study quantum annealing correction schemes designed to improve the performance of quantum annealers in conjunction with minor embedding, thus leading to a hybrid scheme defined over an encoded graph. We argue that this scheme can be efficiently decoded using an energy minimization technique provided the density of errors does not exceed the per-site percolation threshold of the encoded graph. We test the hybrid scheme using a D-Wave Two processor on problems for which the encoded graph is a 2-level grid and the Ising model is known to be NP-hard. The problems we consider are frustrated Ising model problem instances with "planted" (a priori known) solutions. Applied in conjunction with optimized energy penalties and decoding techniques, we find that this approach enables the quantum annealer to solve minor embedded instances with significantly higher success probability than it would without error correction. Our work demonstrates that quantum annealing correction can and should be used to improve the robustness of quantum annealing not only for natively embeddable problems, but also when minor embedding is used to extend the connectivity of physical devices.

**10.    Doubly infinite separation of quantum information and communication**  
Zi-Wen Liu, Christopher Perry, Yechao Zhu, Dax Enshan Koh, Scott Aaronson  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03546  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove the existence of (one-way) communication tasks with a vanishing vs. diverging type of asymptotic gap, which we call "doubly infinite", between quantum information and communication complexities. We do so by showing the following: As the size of the task $n$ increases, the quantum communication complexity of a certain regime of the exclusion game, recently introduced by Perry, Jain, and Oppenheim, scales at least logarithmically in $n$, while the information cost of a winning quantum strategy may tend to zero. The logarithmic lower bound on the quantum communication complexity is shown to hold even if we allow a small probability of error, although the $n$-qubit quantum message of the zero-error strategy can then be compressed polynomially. We leave open the problems of whether the quantum communication complexity of the specified regime scales polynomially in $n$, and whether the gap between quantum and classical communication complexities can be superexponential beyond this regime.

**11.    High cooperativity coupling between a phosphorus donor spin ensemble and a superconducting microwave resonator**  
Christoph W. Zollitsch, Kai Mueller, David P. Franke, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein, Martin S. Brandt, Rudolf Gross, Hans Huebl  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 142105 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03739  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the coupling of an ensemble of phosphorus donors in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si host lattice interacting with a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The microwave transmission spectrum of the resonator shows a normal mode splitting characteristic for high cooperativity. The evaluated collective coupling strength $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is of the same order as the loss rate of the spin system $\gamma$, indicating the onset of strong coupling. We develop a statistical model to describe the influence of temperature on the coupling strength from $50\,\mathrm{mK}$ to $3.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and find a scaling of the coupling strength with the square root of the number of thermally polarized spins.

**12.    Quantum walks on two-dimensional grids with multiple marked locations**  
Nikolajs Nahimovs, Alexander Rivosh  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03788  
<blockquote>
<p>
The running time of a quantum walk search algorithm depends on both the structure of the search space (graph) and the configuration of marked locations. While the first dependence have been studied in a number of papers, the second dependence remains mostly unstudied. We study search by quantum walks on two-dimensional grid using the algorithm of Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh [AKR05]. The original paper analyses one and two marked location cases only. We move beyond two marked locations and study the behaviour of the algorithm for an arbitrary configuration of marked locations. In this paper we prove two results showing the importance of how the marked locations are arranged. First, we present two placements of $k$ marked locations for which the number of steps of the algorithm differs by $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ factor. Second, we present two configurations of $k$ and $\sqrt{k}$ marked locations having the same number of steps and probability to find a marked location.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.04148  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fluctuations of the atomic positions are at the core of a large class of unusual material properties ranging from quantum para-electricity and charge density wave to, possibly, high temperature superconductivity. Their measurement in solids is subject of an intense scientific debate focused on the research of a methodology capable of establishing a direct link between the variance of the ionic displacements and experimentally measurable observables. Here we address this issue by means of non-equilibrium optical experiments performed in shot-noise limited regime. The variance of the time dependent atomic positions and momenta is directly mapped into the quantum fluctuations of the photon number of the scattered probing light. A fully quantum description of the non-linear interactions between photonic and phononic fields unveils evidences of squeezing of thermal phonons in $\alpha-$quartz.

**14.    Modally Resolved Fabry-Perot Experiment with Semiconductor Waveguides**  
B. Pressl, T. Günthner, K. Laiho, J. Ge?ler, M. Kamp, S. H?fling, C. Schneider, G. Weihs  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.04233  
<blockquote>
<p>
Based on the interaction between different spatial modes, semiconductor Bragg-reflection waveguides provide a highly functional platform for non-linear optics. Therefore, the control and engineering of the properties of each spatial mode is essential. Despite the multimodeness of our waveguide, the well-established Fabry-Perot technique for recording fringes in the optical transmission spectrum can successfully be employed for a detailed linear optical characterization when combined with Fourier analysis. A prerequisite for the modal sensitivity is a finely resolved transmission spectrum that is recorded over a broad frequency band. Our results highlight how the features of different spatial modes, such as their loss characteristics and dispersion properties, can be separated from each other allowing their comparison. The mode-resolved measurements are important for optimizing the performance of such multimode waveguides by tailoring the properties of their spatial modes.

<blockquote>
<p>
The generation of nonclassical states of light in miniature chips is a crucial step towards practical implementations of future quantum technologies. Semiconductor materials are ideal to achieve extremely compact and massively parallel systems and several platforms are currently under development. In this context, spontaneous parametric down conversion in AlGaAs devices combines the advantages of room temperature operation, possibility of electrical injection and emission in the telecom band. Here we report on a chip-based AlGaAs source, producing indistinguishable and energy-time entangled photons with a brightness of $7.2\times10^6$ pairs/s and a signal-to-noise ratio of $141\pm12$. Indistinguishability between the photons is demonstrated via a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with a visibility of $89\pm3\%$, while energy-time entanglement is tested via a Franson interferometer leading to a value for the Bell parameter $ S=2.70\pm0.10$.

**16.    A chiral route to spontaneous entanglement generation**  
Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero, Alejandro Gonzalez-Tudela, Francisco J. Garcia-vidal, Esteban Moreno  
Phys. Rev. B 92, 155304 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.05750  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the generation of spontaneous entanglement between two qubits chirally coupled to a waveguide. The maximum achievable concurrence is demonstrated to increase by a factor of $4/e \sim 1.5$ as compared to the non-chiral coupling situation. The proposed entanglement scheme is shown to be robust against variation of the qubit properties such as detuning and separation, which are critical in the non-chiral case. This result relaxes the restrictive requirements of the non-chiral situation, paving the way towards a realistic implementation. Our results demonstrate the potential of chiral waveguides for quantum entanglement protocols.

**17.    Gaussian interferometric power as a measure of continuous variable non-Markovianity**  
Leonardo A. M. Souza, Himadri Shekhar Dhar, Manabendra Nath Bera, Pietro Liuzzo-Scorpo, Gerardo Adesso  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.05798  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the non-Markovianity of continuous variable Gaussian quantum channels through the evolution of an operational metrological quantifier, namely the Gaussian interferometric power, which captures the minimal precision that can be achieved using bipartite Gaussian probes in a black-box phase estimation setup, where the phase shift generator is \emph{a priori} unknown. We observe that the monotonicity of the Gaussian interferometric power under the action of local Gaussian quantum channels on the ancillary arm of the bipartite probes is a natural indicator of Markovian dynamics; consequently, its breakdown for specific maps can be used to construct a witness and an effective quantifier of non-Markovianity. In our work, we consider two paradigmatic Gaussian models, the damping master equation and the quantum Brownian motion, and identify analytically and numerically the parameter regimes that give rise to non-Markovian dynamics. We then quantify the degree of non-Markovianity of the channels in terms of Gaussian interferometric power, showing in particular that even nonentangled probes can be useful to witness non-Markovianity. This establishes an interesting link between the dynamics of bipartite continuous variable open systems and their potential for optical interferometry. The results are an important supplement to the recent research on characterization of non-Markovianity in continuous variable systems.

**18.    Quantum Error Correction for Noisy Quantum Wires**  
Alastair Kay  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06139  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum wires can transport quantum states between distant locations in a solid state scenario without the need for intricate controls in the intervening distance. Fixed usage, time independent schemes permit the pre-manufacture and characterisation of the wires, minimising the resultant error. Nevertheless, noise inevitably enters the system and, even if it acts locally on a single spin at a single instant of time, the intrinsic dynamics of the system rapidly propagate it into a massively correlated error. By modifying the error correction procedure, we prove that in spite of this, standard error correcting codes (the Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes) can be used to protect states against sufficiently low rates of noise during transport through a perfect quantum wire.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06172  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is important to make full use of both wave-like and particle-like natures of light for development of quantum information processing. Harnessing the duality has been, however, hindered by a time-consuming process to match a temporal mode of quadrature measurement with that correlated with photon detection. Here, we demonstrate real-time quadrature measurement of a single-photon wavepacket induced by a photon detection, by utilizing continuous temporal-mode-matching between homodyne detection and an exponentially rising temporal mode. Our method will open a way to universal measurement-based quantum computation.

**20.    Optimal state discrimination and unstructured search in nonlinear quantum mechanics**  
Andrew M. Childs, Joshua Young  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06334  
<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics can solve tasks that are impossible in standard quantum theory, such as perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal states. Here we derive the optimal protocol for distinguishing two states of a qubit using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a model of nonlinear quantum mechanics that arises as an effective description of Bose-Einstein condensates. Using this protocol, we present an algorithm for unstructured search in the Gross-Pitaevskii model, obtaining an exponential improvement over a previous algorithm of Meyer and Wong. This result establishes a limitation on the effectiveness of the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. More generally, we demonstrate similar behavior under a family of related nonlinearities, giving evidence that the ability to quickly discriminate nonorthogonal states and thereby solve unstructured search is a generic feature of nonlinear quantum mechanics.

**21.    Non-Markovian master equation for interacting qubits coupled to a bosonic bath: analytic form and asymptotic approximation**  
Tai-Yin Chiu  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06430  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian dynamics of two interacting two-level qubits coupled to a bosonic bath was previously studied using the quantum-state-diffusion (QSD) equation, where a stochastic state is used to describe the system. In this study, we provide another perspective on this system by deriving the analytic form of the master equation, which describes the system with a reduced density matrix. Then, we validate the master equation by examining entanglement generation and state purity. In addition, with the master equation, we observe the effects from first-order noise and notice that a good asymptotic approximation to the master equation can be made by neglecting the first-order noise.

The existence of a quantum error-correcting code from a solution is also presented.

**23.    Characterizing finite-dimensional quantum behavior**  
Miguel Navascues, Adrien Feix, Mateus Araujo, Tamas Vertesi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.07521  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study and extend the semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020501] for the characterization of the statistical correlations arising from finite dimensional quantum systems. First, we introduce the dimension-constrained noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) paradigm, where a number of polynomial inequalities are defined and optimization is conducted over all feasible operator representations of bounded dimensionality. Important problems in device independent and semi-device independent quantum information science can be formulated (or almost formulated) in this framework. We present effective SDP hierarchies to attack the general dimension-constrained NPO problem (and related ones) and prove their asymptotic convergence. To illustrate the power of these relaxations, we use them to derive new dimension witnesses for temporal and Bell-type correlation scenarios, and also to bound the probability of success of quantum random access codes.

<blockquote>
<p>
A randomly walking quantum particle evolving by Schr\"odinger's equation searches for a unique marked vertex on the "simplex of complete graphs" in time $\Theta(N^{3/4})$. In this paper, we give a weighted version of this graph that preserves vertex-transitivity, and we show that the time to search on it can be reduced to nearly $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$. To prove this, we introduce two novel extensions to degenerate perturbation theory: an adjustment that distinguishes the weights of the edges, and a method to determine how precisely the jumping rate of the quantum walk must be chosen.

**25.    Multi-photon Scattering Theory and Generalized Master Equations**  
Tao Shi, Darrick E. Chang, J. Ignacio Cirac  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.08699  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a scattering theory to investigate the multi-photon transmission in a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of quantum emitters. It is based on a path integral formalism, uses displacement transformations, and does not require the Markov approximation. We obtain the full time-evolution of the global system, including the emitters and the photonic field. Our theory allows us to compute the transition amplitude between arbitrary initial and final states, as well as the S-matrix of the asymptotic in- and out- states. For the case of few incident photons in the waveguide, we also re-derive a generalized master equation in the Markov limit. We compare the predictions of the developed scattering theory and that with the Markov approximation. We illustrate our methods with five examples of few-photon scattering: (i) by a two-level emitter, (ii) in the Jaynes-Cummings model; (iii) by an array of two-level emitters; (iv) by a two-level emitter in the half-end waveguide; (v) by an array of atoms coupled to Rydberg levels. In the first two, we show the application of the scattering theory in the photon scattering by a single emitter, and examine the correctness of our theory with the well-known results. In the third example, we analyze the condition of the Markov approximation for the photon scattering in the array of emitters. In the forth one, we show how a quantum emitter can generate entanglement of out-going photons. Finally, we highlight the interplay between the phenomenon of electromagnetic-induced transparency and the Rydberg interaction, and show how this results in a rich variety of possibilities in the quantum statistics of the scattering photons.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.08782  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a concept of non-Gaussian measurement composed of a non-Gaussian ancillary state, linear optics and adaptive heterodyne measurement, and on the basis of this we also propose a simple scheme of implementing a quantum cubic gate on a traveling light beam. In analysis of the cubic gate in the Heisenberg representation, we find that nonlinearity of the gate is independent from nonclassicality; the nonlinearity is generated solely by a classical nonlinear adaptive control in a measurement-and-feedforward process while the nonclassicality is attached by the non-Gaussian ancilla that suppresses excess noise in the output. By exploiting the noise term as a figure of merit, we consider the optimum non-Gaussian ancilla that can be prepared within reach of current technologies and discuss performance of the gate. It is a crucial step towards experimental implementation of the quantum cubic gate.

<p>
The problems of optimizing the value of an arbitrary observable of the two-level system at both a fixed time and the shortest possible time is theoretically explored. Complete identification and classification along with comprehensive analysis of globally optimal control policies and traps (i.e. policies which are locally but not globally optimal) is presented. The central question addressed is whether the control landscape remains trap-free if control constraints of the inequality type are imposed. The answer is astonishingly controversial, namely, although formally it is always negative, in practice it is positive provided that the control time is fixed and chosen long enough.

**29.    A versatile design for resonant guided-wave parametric down-conversion sources for quantum repeaters**  
Benjamin Brecht, Kai-Hong Luo, Harald Herrmann, Christine Silberhorn  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.08840  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum repeaters - fundamental building blocks for long-distance quantum communication - are based on the interaction between photons and quantum memories. The photons must fulfil stringent requirements on central frequency, spectral bandwidth and purity in order for this interaction to be efficient. We present a design scheme for monolithically integrated resonant photon-pair sources based on parametric down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides, which facilitate the generation of such photons. We investigate the impact of different design parameters on the performance of our source. The generated photon spectral bandwidths can be varied between several tens of MHz up to around $1\,$GHz, facilitating an efficient coupling to different memories. The central frequency of the generated photons can be coarsely tuned by adjusting the pump frequency, poling period and sample temperature and we identify stability requirements on the pump laser and sample temperature that can be readily fulfilled with off-the-shelve components. We find that our source is capable of generating high-purity photons over a wide range of photon bandwidths. Finally, the PDC emission can be frequency fine-tuned over several GHz by simultaneously adjusting the sample temperature and pump frequency. We conclude our study with demonstrating the adaptability of our source to different quantum memories.

**30.    Generalized trace distance measure connecting quantum and classical non-Markovianity**  
Steffen Wi?mann, Bassano Vacchini, Heinz-Peter Breuer  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.08867  
<blockquote>
<p>
We establish a direct connection of quantum Markovianity of an open quantum system to its classical counterpart by generalizing the criterion based on the information flow. Here, the flow is characterized by the time evolution of Helstrom matrices, given by the weighted difference of statistical operators, under the action of the quantum dynamical evolution. It turns out that the introduced criterion is equivalent to P-divisibility of a quantum process, namely divisibility in terms of positive maps, which provides a direct connection to classical Markovian stochastic processes. Moreover, it is shown that similar mathematical representations as those found for the original trace distance based measure hold true for the associated, generalized measure for quantum non-Markovianity. That is, we prove orthogonality of optimal states showing a maximal information backflow and establish a local and universal representation of the measure. We illustrate some properties of the generalized criterion by means of examples.

<p>
The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin-orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.

**32.    Time-optimal bath-induced unitaries by Zermelo navigation: speed limit and non-Markovian quantum computation**  
Jens Clausen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.08990  
<blockquote>
<p>
The solution of the quantum Zermelo navigation problem is applied to the non-Markovian open system dynamics of a set of quantum systems interacting with a common environment. We consider a case allowing an exact time-optimal realization of environment-mediated non-local system unitaries. For a linear coupling to a harmonic bosonic bath, we derive a speed limit for the implementation time in terms of the fundamental frequency of the bath modes. As a product of two exponentials of the local free wind and the pairwise system-coupling, the Zermelo unitary forms a natural building block for reaching a general unitary by concatenation.

<p>
Fundamental to integrated photonic quantum computing is an on-chip method for routing and modulating quantum light emission. We demonstrate a hybrid integration platform consisting of arbitrarily designed waveguide circuits and single photon sources. InAs quantum dots (QD) embedded in GaAs are bonded to an SiON waveguide chip such that the QD emission is coupled to the waveguide mode. The waveguides are SiON core embedded in a SiO2 cladding. A tuneable Mach Zehnder modulates the emission between two output ports and can act as a path-encoded qubit preparation device. The single photon nature of the emission was veri?ed by an on-chip Hanbury Brown and Twiss measurement.

**34.    Monte Carlo studies of the properties of the Majorana quantum error correction code: is self-correction possible during braiding?**

<blockquote>
<p>
The Majorana code is an example of a stabilizer code where the quantum information is stored in a system supporting well-separated Majorana Bound States (MBSs). We focus on one-dimensional realizations of the Majorana code, as well as networks of such structures, and investigate their lifetime when coupled to a parity-preserving thermal environment. We apply the Davies prescription, a standard method that describes the basic aspects of a thermal environment, and derive a master equation in the Born-Markov limit. We first focus on a single wire with immobile MBSs and perform error correction to annihilate thermal excitations. In the high-temperature limit, we show both analytically and numerically that the lifetime of the Majorana qubit grows logarithmically with the size of the wire. We then study a trijunction with four MBSs when braiding is executed. We study the occurrence of dangerous error processes that prevent the lifetime of the Majorana code from growing with the size of the trijunction. The origin of the dangerous processes is the braiding itself, which separates pairs of excitations and renders the noise nonlocal; these processes arise from the basic constraints of moving MBSs in 1D structures. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations in the low-temperature regime, i.e. the regime of practical relevance. Our results put a restriction on the degree of self-correction of this particular 1D topological quantum computing architecture.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.01194  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a new type of quantum walks on simplicial complexes as a natural extension of the well-known Szegedy walk on graphs. One can numerically observe that our proposing quantum walks possess linear spreading and localization as in the case of the Grover walk on lattices. Moreover, our numerical simulation suggests that localization of our quantum walks reflect not only topological but also geometric structures. On the other hand, our proposing quantum walk contains an intrinsic problem concerning exhibition of nontrivial behavior, which is not seen in typical quantum walks such as Grover walks on graphs.

<p>
Quantum computing is a new model of computation, based on quantum physics. Quantum computers can be exponentially faster than conventional computers for problems such as factoring. Besides full-scale quantum computers, more restricted models such as quantum versions of finite automata have been studied. In this paper, we survey various models of quantum finite automata and their properties. We also provide some open questions and new directions for researchers.

**38.    A Thouless Quantum Pump with Ultracold Bosonic Atoms in an Optical Superlattice**

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02225  
<blockquote>
<p>
More than 30 years ago, Thouless introduced the concept of a topological charge pump that would enable the robust transport of charge through an adiabatic cyclic evolution of the underlying Hamiltonian. In contrast to classical transport, the transported charge was shown to be quantized and purely determined by the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust to perturbations. On a fundamental level, the quantized charge transport can be connected to a topological invariant, the Chern number, first introduced in the context of the integer quantum Hall effect. A Thouless quantum pump may therefore be regarded as a 'dynamical' version of the integer quantum Hall effect. Here, we report on the realization of such a topological charge pump using ultracold bosonic atoms that form a Mott insulator in a dynamically controlled optical superlattice potential. By taking in-situ images of the atom cloud, we observe a quantized deflection per pump cycle. We reveal the genuine quantum nature of the pump by showing that, in contrast to ground state particles, a counterintuitive reversed deflection occurs when particles are prepared in the first excited band. Furthermore, we were able to directly demonstrate that the system undergoes a controlled topological phase transition in higher bands when tuning the superlattice parameters.

**39.    Fast Scramblers, Democratic Walks and Information Fields**  
Javier M. Magan  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.02477  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a family of weighted random walks on complete graphs. These `democratic walks' turn out to be explicitly solvable, and we find the hierarchy window for which the characteristic time scale saturates the so-called fast scrambling conjecture. We show that these democratic walks describe well the properties of information spreading in systems in which every degree of freedom interacts with every other degree of freedom, such as Matrix or infinite range models. The argument is based on the analysis of suitably defined `Information fields' ($\mathcal{I}$), which are shown to evolve stochastically towards stationarity due to unitarity of the microscopic model. The model implies that in democratic systems, stabilization of one subsystem is equivalent to global scrambling. We use these results to study scrambling of infalling perturbations in black hole backgrounds, and argue that the near horizon running coupling constants are connected to entanglement evolution of single particle perturbations in democratic systems.

**40.    Efficient Quantum Algorithms for (Gapped) Group Testing and Junta Testing**  
Andris Ambainis, Aleksandrs Belovs, Oded Regev, Ronald de Wolf  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03126  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the $k$-junta testing problem, a tester has to efficiently decide whether a given function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a $k$-junta (i.e., depends on at most $k$ of its input bits) or is $\epsilon$-far from any $k$-junta. Our main result is a quantum algorithm for this problem with query complexity $\tilde O(\sqrt{k/\epsilon})$ and time complexity $\tilde O(n\sqrt{k/\epsilon})$. This quadratically improves over the query complexity of the previous best quantum junta tester, due to At\i c\i\ and Servedio. Our tester is based on a new quantum algorithm for a gapped version of the combinatorial group testing problem, with an up to quartic improvement over the query complexity of the best classical algorithm. For our upper bound on the time complexity we give a near-linear time implementation of a shallow variant of the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group, similar to the Schur-Weyl transform. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(k^{1/3})$ queries for junta-testing (for constant $\epsilon$).

Martin Kiffner, Davide Ceresoli, Wenhui Li, Dieter Jaksch  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03357  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present quantum mechanical calculations of the Auger decay rate $\Gamma_A$ of two Rubidium Rydberg atoms with weakly overlapping electron clouds. The two-electron wavefunction is modelled by a single Slater determinant of $nd$ Rydberg orbitals with principal quantum number $n\le35$. The dependence of $\Gamma_A$ on the atom-atom separation $R$ is well described by a power law $\Gamma_A \propto R^{\alpha}$ and we calculate the exponents $\alpha$ for various initial states. For atomic separations equal to the size of the Rydberg electron wave function $R_n$ we find that $\Gamma_A \propto n^{-5}$. We discuss the importance of Auger decay compared to other contributions to the electron dynamics in the two Rydberg atom system.

**42.    Quantum computation with three-electron double quantum dots at an optimal operation point**  
Sebastian Mehl  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03425  
<blockquote>
<p>
The author analyzes quantum computation with the hybrid qubit (HQ) that is encoded using the three-electron configuration of a double quantum dot. All gate operations are controlled with electric signals, while the qubit remains at an optimal operation point that is insensitive to noise. An effective single-qubit description is derived, and two-qubit interactions are suggested using Coulomb and exchange interactions. Universal quantum control is described and numerically simulated using realistic parameters for HQs in Si and GaAs. High-fidelity quantum computing at the threshold of quantum error correction is possible if the Coulomb interactions between the HQs stay weak.

Mark D. Jenkins  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03579  
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis explores the coupling of magnetic systems to quantum circuits in the context of quantum computing applications. In particular we study the coupling of superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators to Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs) . The combination of approaches from the fields of Cavity Quantum electrodynamics (QED) and Circuit QED with those from the field of molecular magnetism con provide unique opportunities for quantum computing. We investigate the necessary conditions for coupling single spins and spin ensembles to resonators and what characteristics SMMs should have in order to provide interesting alternatives as quantum bits. We present test measurements of several magnetic samples using both broadband spectroscopy with open waveguides and EPR spectroscopy using coplanar waveguide resonators. We also design, fabricate, and test nanometric constrictions in superconducting resonators with the objective of improving their coupling to single spins. We evaluate the performance of these constricted resonators in comparison to unmodified resonators.

**44.    High fidelity ac gate operations of the quantum dot hybrid qubit**  
Clement H. Wong  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.04286  
<blockquote>
<p>
Semiconductor quantum dots in silicon are promising qubits because of long spin coherence times and their potential for scalability. However, such qubits with complete electrical control and fidelities above the threshold for quantum error correction have not yet been achieved. We show theoretically that the threshold fidelity can be achieved with ac gate operation of the quantum dot hybrid qubit. Formed by three electrons in a double dot, this qubit is electrically controlled, does not require magnetic fields, and runs at GHz gate speeds. We analyze the decoherence caused by 1/f charge noise in this qubit, find parameters that minimize the charge noise dependence in the qubit frequency, and determine the optimal working points for ac gate operations that drive the detuning and tunnel coupling.

**45.    The Power of Quantum Fourier Sampling**  
Bill Fefferman, Chris Umans  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.05592  
<blockquote>
<p>
A line of work initiated by Terhal and DiVincenzo and Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd, shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that cannot be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical computer, unless the PH collapses. Aaronson and Arkhipov take this further by considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance, unless the PH collapses. In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures. In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions each of which is based on an "Efficiently Specifiable" polynomial, for which a classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar #P-hard polynomials. Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov, likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling hardness results.

**46.    Non-Hermitian transparency and one-way transport in low-dimensional lattices by an imaginary gauge field**

Phys. Rev. B 92, 094204 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.07651  
<blockquote>
<p>
Unidirectional and robust transport is generally observed at the edge of two- or three-dimensional quantum Hall and topological insulator systems. A hallmark of these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative edge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the system. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in non-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\it imaginary} gauge field. As compared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological insulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\it lower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport properties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge field are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying robust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden because reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the spectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into the one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field, {\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the gauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the presence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred to as {\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be also realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems, in which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous Hermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric (non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian transparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring resonators, is suggested.
