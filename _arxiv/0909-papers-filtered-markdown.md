**1.    Non-Markovian Entanglement Dynamics of Two Qubits Interacting with a Common Electromagnetic Field**  
C. Anastopoulos, S. Shresta, B. L. Hu  
. Inf. Proc. 8, 549 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0223  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pair of qubits made of two-level atoms separated in space with distance $r$ and interacting with one common electromagnetic field but not directly with each other. Our calculation makes a weak coupling assumption but no Born or Markov approximation. We write the evolution equations of the reduced density matrix of the two-qubit system after integrating out the electromagnetic field modes. We study two classes of states in detail: Class A is a one parameter family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and lowest energy states, and Class B states which are the linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell states. Our results for an initial Bell state are similar to those obtained before for the same model derived under the Born-Markov approximation. However, in the Class A states the behavior is qualitatively different: under the non-Markovian evolution we do not see sudden death of quantum entanglement and subsequent revivals, except when the qubits are sufficiently far apart. We provide explanations for such differences of behavior both between these two classes of states and between the predictions from the Markov and non-Markovian dynamics. We also study the decoherence of this two-qubit system.

**2.    Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effect in atom-atom entanglement induced by non-Markovian environment**  
Yang Li, Hong Guo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0375  
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamic behavior of the entanglement for two two-level atoms coupled to a common lossy cavity is studied. We find that the speed of disentanglement is a decreasing (increasing) function of the damping rate of the cavity for on/near (far-off) resonant couplings. The quantitative explanations for these phenomena are given, and further, it is shown that they are related to the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effect induced by the non-Markovian environment.

**3.    Splitting of quantum information in traveling wave fields using only linear optical elements**  
W. B. Cardoso, N. G. de Almeida, A. T. Avelar, B. Baseia  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0429  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this brief report we present a feasible scheme to split quantum information in the realm of traveling waves. An oversimplified scheme is also proposed for the generation of a class of W states useful for perfect teleportation and superdense coding. The scheme employs only linear optical elements as beam splitters and phase shifters, in addition to photon counters and one-photon sources. It is shown that splitting of quantum information with high fidelity is possible even including inefficiency of the detectors and photoabsorption of the beam splitters.

**4.    Microwave Control of Atomic Motion in Optical Lattices**  
Leonid F?rster, Micha? Karski, Jai-Min Choi, Andreas Steffen, Wolfgang Alt, Dieter Meschede, Artur Widera, Enrique Montano, Jae Hoon Lee, Worawarong Rakreungdet, Poul S. Jessen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0678  
<blockquote>
<p>
We control the quantum mechanical motion of neutral atoms in an optical lattice by driving microwave transitions between spin states whose trapping potentials are spatially offset. Control of this offset with nanometer precision allows for adjustment of the coupling strength between different motional states, analogous to an adjustable effective Lamb-Dicke factor. This is used both for efficient one-dimensional sideband cooling of individual atoms to a vibrational ground state population of 97%, and to drive coherent Rabi oscillation between arbitrary pairs of vibrational states. We further show that microwaves can drive well resolved transitions between motional states in maximally offset, shallow lattices, and thus in principle allow for coherent control of long range quantum transport.

**5.    A simple approach to approximate quantum error correction based on the transpose channel**  
Hui Khoon Ng, Prabha Mandayam  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 062342 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0931  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that there exists a universal, near-optimal recovery map---the transpose channel---for approximate quantum error-correcting codes, where optimality is defined using the worst-case fidelity. Using the transpose channel, we provide an alternative interpretation of the standard quantum error correction (QEC) conditions, and generalize them to a set of conditions for approximate QEC (AQEC) codes. This forms the basis of a simple algorithm for finding AQEC codes. Our analytical approach is a departure from earlier work relying on exhaustive numerical search for the optimal recovery map, with optimality defined based on entanglement fidelity. For the practically useful case of codes encoding a single qubit of information, our algorithm is particularly easy to implement.

**6.    Fractional Generalization of Quantum Markovian Master Equation**  
Vasily E. Tarasov  
Theoretical and Mathematical Physics. Vol.158. No.2. (2008) 179-195  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0965  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove a generalization of the quantum Markovian equation for observables. In this generalized equation, we use superoperators that are fractional powers of completely dissipative superoperators. We prove that the suggested superoperators are infinitesimal generators of completely positive semigroups and describe the properties of this semigroup. We solve the proposed fractional quantum Markovian equation for the harmonic oscillator with linear friction. A fractional power of the Markovian superoperator can be considered a parameter describing a measure of "screening" of the environment of the quantum system: the environmental influence on the system is absent for $\alpha=0$, the environment completely influences the system for $\alpha=1$, and we have a powerlike environmental influence for $0<\alpha<1$.

**7.    Waveguide-based OPO source of entangled photon pairs**  
Enrico Pomarico, Bruno Sanguinetti, Nicolas Gisin, Robert Thew, Hugo Zbinden, Gerhard Schreiber, Abu Thomas, Wolfgang Sohler  
New Journal of Physics 11, 113042 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1208  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we present a compact source of narrow-band energy-time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime based on a Ti-indiffused Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) waveguide resonator, i.e. a waveguide with end-face dielectric multi-layer mirrors. This is a monolithic doubly resonant Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) far below threshold, which generates photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) at around 1560nm with a 117MHz (0.91 pm)- bandwidth. A coherence time of 2.7 ns is estimated by a time correlation measurement and a high quality of the entangled states is confirmed by a Bell-type experiment. Since highly coherent energy-time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime are suitable for long distance transmission and manipulation, this source is well suited to the requirements of quantum communication.

**8.    Decoherence in Two-Dimensional Quantum Random Walks with Traps**  
Meltem Gonulol, Ekrem Aydiner, Ozgur E. Mustecaplioglu  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 022336 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1353  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walk in a two-dimensional lattice with randomly distributed traps is investigated. Distributions of quantum walkers are evaluated dynamically for the cases of Hadamard, Fourier, and Grover coins, and quantum to classical transition is examined as a function of the density of the traps. It is shown that traps act as a serious and additional source of quantum decoherence. Furthermore, non-trivial temporal dependence of the standard deviation of the probability distribution of the walker is found when the trapping imperfections are introduced.

**9.    Exponentially more concise quantum recognition of non-RMM regular languages**  
Daowen Qiu, Lvzhou Li, Paulo Mateus, Amilcar Sernadas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1428  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that there are quantum devices that accept all regular languages and that are exponentially more concise than deterministic finite automata (DFA). For this purpose, we introduce a new computing model of {\it one-way quantum finite automata} (1QFA), namely, {\it one-way quantum finite automata together with classical states} (1QFAC), which extends naturally both measure-only 1QFA and DFA and whose state complexity is upper-bounded by both. The original contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show that the set of languages accepted by 1QFAC with bounded error consists precisely of all regular languages. Second, we prove that 1QFAC are at most exponentially more concise than DFA. Third, we show that the previous bound is tight for families of regular languages that are not recognized by measure-once (RMO), measure-many (RMM) and multi-letter 1QFA. % More concretely we exhibit regular languages $L^0(m)$ for $m$ prime such that: (i) $L^0(m)$ cannot be recognized by measure-once, measure-many and multi-letter 1QFA; (ii) the minimal DFA that accepts $L^0(m)$ has $O(m)$ states; (iii) there is a 1QFAC with constant classical states and $O(\log(m))$ quantum basis that accepts $L^0(m)$. Fourth, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether any two 1QFAC are equivalent. Finally, we show that state minimization of 1QFAC is decidable within EXPSPACE. We conclude the paper by posing some open problems.

**10.    Approximate quantum error correction for correlated noise**  
Avraham Ben-Aroya, Amnon Ta-Shma  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1466  
<blockquote>
<p>
Most of the research done on quantum error correction studies an error model in which each qubit is affected by noise, independently of the other qubits. In this paper we study a different noise model -- one in which the noise may be correlated with the qubits it acts upon. We show both positive and negative results. On the one hand, we show controlled-X errors cannot be perfectly corrected, yet can be approximately corrected with sub-constant approximation error. On the other hand, we show that no non-trivial quantum error correcting code can approximately correct controlled phase error with sub-constant approximation error.

**11.    Optical implementation of a unitarily correctable code**  
Kurt M. Schreiter, Aron Pasieka, Rainer Kaltenbaek, Kevin J. Resch, David W. Kribs  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 022311 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1584  
<blockquote>
<p>
Noise poses a challenge for any real-world implementation in quantum information science. The theory of quantum error correction deals with this problem via methods to encode and recover quantum information in a way that is resilient against that noise. Unitarily correctable codes are an error correction technique wherein a single unitary recovery operation is applied without the need for an ancilla Hilbert space. Here, we present the first optical implementation of a non-trivial unitarily correctable code for a noisy quantum channel with no decoherence-free subspaces or noiseless subsystems. We show that recovery of our initial states is achieved with high fidelity (>=0.97), quantitatively proving the efficacy of this unitarily correctable code.

**12.    Stabilizing Open Quantum Systems by Markovian Reservoir Engineering**  
S.G. Schirmer, Xiaoting Wang  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 062306 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1596  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study open quantum systems whose evolution is governed by a master equation of Kossakowski-Gorini-Sudarshan-Lindblad type and give a characterization of the convex set of steady states of such systems based on the generalized Bloch representation. It is shown that an isolated steady state of the Bloch equation cannot be a center, i.e., that the existence of a unique steady state implies attractivity and global asymptotic stability. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique steady state are derived and applied to different physical models including two- and four-level atoms, (truncated) harmonic oscillators, composite and decomposable systems. It is shown how these criteria could be exploited in principle for quantum reservoir engineeing via coherent control and direct feedback to stabilize the system to a desired steady state. We also discuss the question of limit points of the dynamics. Despite the non-existence of isolated centers, open quantum systems can have nontrivial invariant sets. These invariant sets are center manifolds that arise when the Bloch superoperator has purely imaginary eigenvalues and are closely related to decoherence-free subspaces.

**13.    On photonic controlled phase gates**  
K. Kieling, J.L. O'Brien, J. Eisert  
New J. Phys. 12, 013003 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2057  
<blockquote>
<p>
As primitives for entanglement generation, controlled phase gates take a central role in quantum computing. Especially in ideas realizing instances of quantum computation in linear optical gate arrays a closer look can be rewarding. In such architectures, all effective non-linearities are induced by measurements: Hence the probability of success is a crucial parameter of such quantum gates. In this note, we discuss this question for controlled phase gates that implement an arbitrary phase with one and two control qubits. Within the class of post-selected gates in dual-rail encoding with vacuum ancillas we identify the optimal success probabilities. We construct networks that allow for an implementation by means of todays experimental capabilities in detail. The methods employed here appear specifically useful with the advent of integrated linear optical circuits, providing stable interferometers on monolithic structures.

**14.    Demonstration of the asymmetric lateral Casimir force between corrugated surfaces in the nonadditive regime**  
H.-C. Chiu, G.L. Klimchitskaya, V.N. Marachevsky, V.M. Mostepanenko, U. Mohideen  
Phys. Rev. B, v.80, N12, 121402(R)-1-4 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2161  
<blockquote>
<p>
The measurement of the lateral Casimir force between two aligned sinusoidally corrugated Au-coated surfaces has been performed in the nonadditive regime. The use of deeper corrugations also allowed to demonstrate an asymmetry in the phase dependences of the lateral Casimir force, as predicted earlier. The measurement data are found to be in excellent agreement with the exact theoretical results computed at T=300 K including effect of real material properties. The deviations between the exact theory and the proximity force approximation are quantified. The obtained results are topical for applications in nanomachines.

**15.    A Fault Tolerant, Area Efficient Architecture for Shor's Factoring Algorithm**  
Mark G. Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel, John Kubiatowicz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2188  
<blockquote>
<p>
We optimize the area and latency of Shor's factoring while simultaneously improving fault tolerance through: (1) balancing the use of ancilla generators, (2) aggressive optimization of error correction, and (3) tuning the core adder circuits. Our custom CAD flow produces detailed layouts of the physical components and utilizes simulation to analyze circuits in terms of area, latency, and success probability. We introduce a metric, called ADCR, which is the probabilistic equivalent of the classic Area-Delay product. Our error correction optimization can reduce ADCR by an order of magnitude or more. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the area of an optimized quantum circuit is not dominated exclusively by error correction. Further, our adder evaluation shows that quantum carry-lookahead adders (QCLA) beat ripple-carry adders in ADCR, despite being larger and more complex. We conclude with what we believe is one of most accurate estimates of the area and latency required for 1024-bit Shor's factorization: 7659 mm$^{2}$ for the smallest circuit and $6 * 10^8$ seconds for the fastest circuit.

**16.    Reconstruction of Markovian Master Equation parameters through symplectic tomography**  
Bruno Bellomo, Antonella De Pasquale, Giulia Gualdi, Ugo Marzolino  
Physical Review A 80, 052108 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2250  
<blockquote>
<p>
In open quantum systems, phenomenological master equations with unknown parameters are often introduced. Here we propose a time-independent procedure based on quantum tomography to reconstruct the potentially unknown parameters of a wide class of Markovian master equations. According to our scheme, the system under investigation is initially prepared in a Gaussian state. At an arbitrary time t, in order to retrieve the unknown coefficients one needs to measure only a finite number (ten at maximum) of points along three time-independent tomograms. Due to the limited amount of measurements required, we expect our proposal to be especially suitable for experimental implementations.

Tamas Vertesi, Stefano Pironio, Nicolas Brunner  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 060401 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the detection efficiencies required for closing the detection loophole in Bell tests can be significantly lowered using quantum systems of dimension larger than two. We introduce a series of asymmetric Bell tests for which an efficiency arbitrarily close to 1/N can be tolerated using N-dimensional systems, and a symmetric Bell test for which the efficiency can be lowered down to 61.8% using four-dimensional systems. Experimental perspectives for our schemes look promising considering recent progress in atom-photon entanglement and in photon hyperentanglement.

Tarun Kumar, Aranya B Bhattacherjee, ManMohan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3617  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dynamics of a movable mirror (cantilever) of a nonlinear optical cavity. We show that a $\chi^{(3)}$ medium with a strong Kerr nonlinearity placed inside a cavity inhibits the normal mode splitting (NMS) due to the photon blockade mechanism. This study demonstrates that NMS could be used as a tool to observe the photon blockade effect. We also found that the backaction cooling of the movable mirror is reduced in the presence of the Kerr medium.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider entropic uncertainty relations for outcomes of the measurements of a quantum state in 3 or more mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), chosen from the standard construction of MUBs in prime dimension. We show that, for any choice of 3 MUBs and at least one choice of a larger number of MUBs, the best possible entropic uncertainty relation can be only marginally better than the one that trivially follows from the relation by Maassen and Uffink (PRL, 1987) for 2 bases.

Agata M Bra\'nczyk et al 2010 New J. Phys. 12 063001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4147  
<blockquote>
<p>
The generation of heralded pure Fock states via spontaneous parametric down conversion (PDC) relies on perfect photon-number correlations in the output modes. Correlations in any other degree of freedom, however, degrade the purity of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent of generating heralded 1- and 2-photon Fock states, we expand the output state of the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate, g(2) and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the resulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased photon-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788 nm and 1930 nm. The latter two allow the fulfillment of extended phase matching conditions in an attempt to eliminate spectral correlations in the PDC output state without the use of filtering, however, we find that even in these cases, some filtering is needed to achieve states of very high purity.

**22.    Information Flow in Secret Sharing Protocols**  
Elham Kashefi, Damian Markham, Mehdi Mhalla, Simon Perdrix  
EPTCS 9, 2009, pp. 87-97  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4479  
<blockquote>
<p>
The entangled graph states have emerged as an elegant and powerful quantum resource, indeed almost all multiparty protocols can be written in terms of graph states including measurement based quantum computation (MBQC), error correction and secret sharing amongst others. In addition they are at the forefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent opportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these elements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret sharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow. We do so with two main contributions. First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access which information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct graphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph theory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to present new secret sharing protocols. Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow, i.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to include vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence considered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits in terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns to secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is believed also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based schemes, for example in constructing fault tolerant MBQC schemes.

Phys. Rev. A 80, 052313 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4599  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use the language of semidefinite programming and duality to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal Lewenstein-Sanpera Decomposition (LSD) of 2-qubit states. We first provide a simple and natural derivation of the Wellens-Kus equations for full-rank states. Then, we obtain a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal decomposition of rank-3 states. This closes the gap between the full-rank case, where optimality conditions are given by the Wellens-Kus equations, and the rank-2 case, where the optimal decomposition is analytically known. We also give an analytic expression for the optimal LSD of a special class of rank-3 states. Finally, our formulation ensures efficient numerical procedures to return the optimal LSD for any arbitrary 2-qubit state.

**24.    Nested Quantum Error Correction Codes**  
Zhuo Wang, Kai Sun, Hen Fan, Vlatko Vedral  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5103  
<blockquote>
<p>
The theory of quantum error correction was established more than a decade ago as the primary tool for fighting decoherence in quantum information processing. Although great progress has already been made in this field, limited methods are available in constructing new quantum error correction codes from old codes. Here we exhibit a simple and general method to construct new quantum error correction codes by nesting certain quantum codes together. The problem of finding long quantum error correction codes is reduced to that of searching several short length quantum codes with certain properties. Our method works for all length and all distance codes, and is quite efficient to construct optimal or near optimal codes. Two main known methods in constructing new codes from old codes in quantum error-correction theory, the concatenating and pasting, can be understood in the framework of nested quantum error correction codes.

<p>
We derive a time-convolutionless master equation for the spin-boson model in the weak coupling limit. The temporarily negative decay rates in the master equation indicate short time memory effects in the dynamics which is explicitly revealed when the dynamics is studied using the non-Markovian jump description. The approach gives new insight into the memory effects influencing the spin dynamics and demonstrates, how for the spin-boson model the the co-operative action of different channels complicates the detection of memory effects in the dynamics.

<blockquote>
<p>
Accurate measurement of relative distance and orientation of two nearby quantum particles is discussed. We are in particular interested in a realistic description requiring as little prior knowledge about the system as possible. Thus, unlike in previous studies, we consider the case of an arbitrary relative orientation of the two atoms. For this, we model the atom with complete Zeeman manifolds, and include parallel as well as orthogonal dipole-dipole couplings between all states of the two atoms. We find that it is possible to determine the distance of the two atoms independent of the orientation, as long as the particles are sufficiently close to each other. Next, we discuss how in addition the alignment of the atoms can be measured. For this, we focus on the two cases of atoms in a two-dimensional waveguide and of atoms on a surface.

**29.    Implications of Simultaneous Requirements for Low Noise Exchange Gates in Double Quantum Dots**  
Erik Nielsen, Ralph W. Young, Richard P. Muller, M. S. Carroll  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0047  
<blockquote>
<p>
Achieving low-error, exchange-interaction operations in quantum dots for quantum computing imposes simultaneous requirements on the exchange energy's dependence on applied voltages. A double quantum dot (DQD) qubit, approximated with a quadratic potential, is solved using a full configuration interaction method. This method is more accurate than Heitler-London and Hund-Mulliken approaches and captures new and significant qualitative behavior. We show that multiple regimes can be found in which the exchange energy's dependence on the bias voltage between the dots is compatible with current quantum error correction codes and state-of-the-art electronics. Identifying such regimes may prove valuable for the construction and operation of quantum gates that are robust to charge fluctuations, particularly in the case of dynamically corrected gates.
