**1.    Fidelity and information in the quantum teleportation of continuous variables**  
Holger F. Hofmann, Toshiki Ide, Takayoshi Kobayashi, Akira Furusawa

<blockquote>
<p>
Ideally, quantum teleportation should transfer a quantum state without distortion and without providing any information about that state. However, quantum teleportation of continuous electromagnetic field variables introduces additional noise, limiting the fidelity of the quantum state transfer. In this article, the operator describing the quantum state transfer is derived. The transfer operator modifies the probability amplitudes of the quantum state in a shifted photon number base by enhancing low photon numbers and suppressing high photon numbers. This modification of the statistical weight corresponds to a measurement of finite resolution performed on the original quantum state. The limited fidelity of quantum teleportation is thus shown to be a direct consequence of the information obtained in the measurement.

**2.    Casimir and van der Waals force between two plates or a sphere (lens) above a plate made of real metals**  
G.L. Klimchitskaya, U. Mohideen, V.M. Mostepanenko

<blockquote>
<p>
The Casimir and van der Waals forces acting between two metallic plates or a sphere (lens) above a plate are calculated accounting for the finite conductivity of the metals. The simple formalism of surface modes is briefly presented which allows the possibility to obtain the generalization of Lifshitz results for the case of two semi-spaces covered by the thin layers. Additional clarifications of the regularization procedure provides the means to obtain reliable results not only for the force but also for the energy density. This, in turn, leads to the value of the force for the configuration of a sphere (lens) above a plate both of which are covered by additional layers. The Casimir interaction between Al and Au test bodies is recalculated using the optical tabulated data for the complex refractive index of these metals. The computations turn out to be in agreement with the perturbation theory up to the fourth order in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point oscillations into the metal. The disagreements between the results recently presented in the literature are resolved. The Casimir force between Al bodies covered by the thin Au layers is computed and the possibility to neglect spatial dispersion effects is discussed as a function the layer thickness. The van der Waals force is calculated including the transition region to the Casimir force. The pure non-retarded van der Waals force law between Al and Au bodies is shown to be restricted to a very narrow distance interval from 0.5 nm to (2--4) nm. New, more exact, values of the Hamaker constant for Al and Au are determined.

**3.    Private Quantum Channels and the Cost of Randomizing Quantum Information**  
Michele Mosca, Alain Tapp, Ronald de Wolf  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003101  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate how a classical private key can be used by two players, connected by an insecure one-way quantum channel, to perform private communication of quantum information. In particular we show that in order to transmit n qubits privately, 2n bits of shared private key are necessary and sufficient. This result may be viewed as the quantum analogue of the classical one-time pad encryption scheme. From the point of view of the eavesdropper, this encryption process can be seen as a randomization of the original state. We thus also obtain strict bounds on the amount of entropy necessary for randomizing n qubits.

**4.    Computing with highly mixed states**  
Andris Ambainis, Leonard J. Schulman, Umesh Vazirani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003136  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum computing in the k-qubit model where the starting state of a quantum computer consists of k qubits in a pure state and n-k qubits in a maximally mixed state. We ask the following question: is there a general method for simulating an arbitrary m-qubit pure state quantum computation by a quantum computation in the k-qubit model? We show that, under certain constraints, this is impossible, unless m=O(k+ log n).

**5.    Error Avoiding Quantum Codes and Dynamical Stabilization of Grover's Algorithm**  
Michael Mussinger, Aldo Delgado, Gernot Alber  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003141  
<blockquote>
<p>
An error avoiding quantum code is presented which is capable of stabilizing Grover's quantum search algorithm against a particular class of coherent errors. This error avoiding code consists of states only which are factorizable in the computational basis. Furthermore, its redundancy is smaller than the one which is achievable with a general error correcting quantum code saturating the quantum Hamming bound. The fact that this code consists of factorizable states only may offer advantages for the implementation of quantum gates in the error free subspace.

**6.    Frequency dependence of the photonic noise spectrum in an absorbing or amplifying diffusive medium**  
E. G. Mishchenko, M. Patra, C. W. J. Beenakker  
Eur.Phys.J.D 13, 289 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0003262  
<blockquote>
<p>
A theory is presented for the frequency dependence of the power spectrum of photon current fluctuations originating from a disordered medium. Both the cases of an absorbing medium (``grey body'') and of an amplifying medium (``random laser'') are considered in a waveguide geometry. The semiclassical approach (based on a Boltzmann-Langevin equation) is shown to be in complete agreement with a fully quantum mechanical theory, provided that the effects of wave localization can be neglected. The width of the peak in the power spectrum around zero frequency is much smaller than the inverse coherence time, characteristic for black-body radiation. Simple expressions for the shape of this peak are obtained, in the absorbing case, for waveguide lengths large compared to the absorption length, and, in the amplifying case, close to the laser threshold.

**7.    Naked Singularity Explosion**  
Tomohiro Harada, Hideo Iguchi, Ken-ichi Nakao  
Phys.Rev.D61:101502,2000  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0003036  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that the gravitational collapse of a dust ball results in naked singularity formation from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. In this paper, we show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the naked singularity.
