**1.    Quantum Walks with Non-Orthogonal Position States**  
R. Matjeschk, A. Ahlbrecht, M. Enderlein, Ch. Cedzich, A. H. Werner, M. Keyl, T. Schaetz, R. F. Werner  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 240503 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0220  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have by now been realized in a large variety of different physical settings. In some of these, particularly with trapped ions, the walk is implemented in phase space, where the corresponding position states are not orthogonal. We develop a general description of such a quantum walk and show how to map it into a standard one with orthogonal states, thereby making available all the tools developed for the latter. This enables a variety of experiments, which can be implemented with smaller step sizes and more steps. Tuning the non-orthogonality allows for an easy preparation of extended states such as momentum eigenstates, which travel at a well-defined speed with low dispersion. We introduce a method to adjust their velocity by momentum shifts, which allows to investigate intriguing effects such as the analog of Bloch oscillations.

**2.    Block synchronization for quantum information**  
Yuichiro Fujiwara  
Physical Review A 87, 022344 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0260  
<blockquote>
<p>
Locating the boundaries of consecutive blocks of quantum information is a fundamental building block for advanced quantum computation and quantum communication systems. We develop a coding theoretic method for properly locating boundaries of quantum information without relying on external synchronization when block synchronization is lost. The method also protects qubits from decoherence in a manner similar to conventional quantum error-correcting codes, seamlessly achieving synchronization recovery and error correction. A family of quantum codes that are simultaneously synchronizable and error-correcting is given through this approach.

Nature Communications 4, 1747 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0592  
<blockquote>
<p>
Controlled non-local energy and coherence transfer enables light harvesting in photosynthesis and non-local logical operations in quantum computing. The most relevant mechanism of coherent coupling of distant qubits is coupling via the electromagnetic field. Here, we demonstrate the controlled coherent coupling of spatially separated excitonic qubits via the photon mode of a solid state microresonator. This is revealed by two-dimensional spectroscopy of the sample's coherent response, a sensitive and selective probe of the coherent coupling. The experimental results are quantitatively described by a rigorous theory of the cavity mediated coupling within a cluster of quantum dots excitons. Having demonstrated this mechanism, it can be used in extended coupling channels - sculptured, for instance, in photonic crystal cavities - to enable a long-range, non-local wiring up of individual emitters in solids.

**4.    How Low Can Approximate Degree and Quantum Query Complexity be for Total Boolean Functions?**  
Andris Ambainis, Ronald de Wolf  
Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC'13), 2013  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0717  
<blockquote>
<p>
It has long been known that any Boolean function that depends on n input variables has both degree and exact quantum query complexity of Omega(log n), and that this bound is achieved for some functions. In this paper we study the case of approximate degree and bounded-error quantum query complexity. We show that for these measures the correct lower bound is Omega(log n / loglog n), and we exhibit quantum algorithms for two functions where this bound is achieved.

**5.    Quantum Markov Networks and Commuting Hamiltonians**  
Winton Brown, David Poulin  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0755  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Markov networks are a generalization of quantum Markov chains to arbitrary graphs. They provide a powerful classification of correlations in quantum many-body systems---complementing the area law at finite temperature---and are therefore useful to understand the powers and limitations of certain classes of simulation algorithms. Here, we extend the characterization of quantum Markov networks and in particular prove the equivalence of positive quantum Markov networks and Gibbs states of Hamiltonians that are the sum of local commuting terms on graphs containing no triangles. For more general graphs we demonstrate the equivalence between quantum Markov networks and Gibbs states of a class of Hamiltonians of intermediate complexity between commuting and general local Hamiltonians.

**6.    A meet-in-the-middle algorithm for fast synthesis of depth-optimal quantum circuits**  
Matthew Amy, Dmitri Maslov, Michele Mosca, Martin Roetteler  
IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 32(6): 818-830, 2013  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0758  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical operations, leveraging a meet-in-the-middle technique to provide a significant speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an illustration of our method we implemented this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used quantum logical operations into elementary gates in the Clifford+T set. In particular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of Clifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby providing a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the Toffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the algorithm is only practical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the number of gates in an optimal implementation.

**7.    The Quantum Frontier**  
Joseph F. Fitzsimons, Eleanor G. Rieffel, Valerio Scarani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0785  
<blockquote>
<p>
The success of the abstract model of computation, in terms of bits, logical operations, programming language constructs, and the like, makes it easy to forget that computation is a physical process. Our cherished notions of computation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the physics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to ask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of a classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of computation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel cryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small quantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are underway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices, the quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight into the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of the physics of our universe and its connections with computation. We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of a quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of a number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and highlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena described were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was quantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more dramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these oddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe next. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for future work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum information ultimately comes from.

**8.    Proof of finite surface code threshold for matching**  
Austin G. Fowler  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 180502 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0800  
<blockquote>
<p>
The field of quantum computation currently lacks a formal proof of experimental feasibility. Qubits are fragile and sophisticated quantum error correction is required to achieve reliable quantum computation. The surface code is a promising quantum error correction code, requiring only a physically reasonable 2-D lattice of qubits with nearest neighbor interactions. However, existing proofs that reliable quantum computation is possible using this code assume the ability to measure four-body operators and, despite making this difficult to realize assumption, require that the error rate of these operator measurements is less than 10^-9, an unphysically low target. High error rates have been proved tolerable only when assuming tunable interactions of strength and error rate independent of distance, which is also unphysical. In this work, given a 2-D lattice of qubits with only nearest neighbor two-qubit gates, and single-qubit measurement, initialization, and unitary gates, all of which have error rate p, we prove that arbitrarily reliable quantum computation is possible provided p<7.4x10^-4, a target that many experiments have already achieved. This closes a long-standing open problem, formally proving the experimental feasibility of quantum computation under physically reasonable assumptions.

**9.    Advantages of Coherent Feedback for Cooling Quantum Oscillators**  
Ryan Hamerly, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0829  
<blockquote>
<p>
We model the cooling of open optical and optomechanical resonators via optical feedback in the Linear Quadratic Gaussian setting of stochastic control theory. We show that coherent feedback control schemes, in which the resonator is embedded in an interferometer to achieve all-optical feedback, can outperform the best possible measurement-based schemes in the quantum regime of low steady-state excitation number. Such performance gains are attributed to the coherent controller's ability to process non-commuting output field quadratures simultaneously without loss of fidelity, and may provide important clues for the design of coherent feedback schemes for more general problems of nonlinear and robust control.

**10.    Continuous deformations of the Grover walk preserving localization**  
Martin Stefanak, Iva Bezdekova, Igor Jex  
Eur. Phys. J. D 66 5 (2012) 142  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0881  
<blockquote>
<p>
The three-state Grover walk on a line exhibits the localization effect characterized by a non-vanishing probability of the particle to stay at the origin. We present two continuous deformations of the Grover walk which preserve its localization nature. The resulting quantum walks differ in the rate at which they spread through the lattice. The velocities of the left and right-traveling probability peaks are given by the maximum of the group velocity. We find the explicit form of peak velocities in dependence on the coin parameter. Our results show that localization of the quantum walk is not a singular property of an isolated coin operator but can be found for entire families of coins.

**11.    Transformation of quantum photonic circuit models by term rewriting**  
Gopal Sarma, Ryan Hamerly, Nikolas Tezak, Dmitri S. Pavlichin, Hideo Mabuchi  
IEEE Photonics 5, 1 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1104  
<blockquote>
<p>
The development of practical methods for synthesis and verification of complex photonic circuits presents a grand challenge for the nascent field of quantum engineering. Of course, classical electrical engineering provides essential foundations and serves to illustrate the degree of sophistication that can be achieved in automated circuit design. In this paper we explore the utility of term rewriting approaches to the transformation of quantum circuit models, specifically applying rewrite rules for both reduction/verification and robustness analysis of photonic circuits for autonomous quantum error correction. We outline a workflow for quantum photonic circuit analysis that leverages the Modelica framework for multi-domain physical modeling, which parallels a previously described approach based on VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL).

**12.    Discrete Fourier-based Correlations for Entanglement Detection**  
Ryo Namiki, Yuuki Tokunaga  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 230503 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1119  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce two forms of correlations on two $d$-level (qudit) systems for entanglement detection. The correlations can be measured via experimentally tractable two local measurement settings and their separable bounds are determined by discrete Fourier-based uncertainty relations. They are useful to estimate lower bounds of the Schmidt number in order to clarify generation of a genuine qudit entanglement. We also present inseparable conditions for multi-qudit systems associated with the qudit stabilizer formalism as another role of the correlations on the inseparability problem.

**13.    Quasi non-Markovian approach to the study of decoherence of a controlled-not quantum gate in a chain of few nuclear spins quantum computer**  
Pablo López, Gustavo López  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1537  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop in the weak coupling approximation a quasi-non-Markovian master equation and study the phenomenon of decoherence during the operation of a controlled-not (CNOT) quantum gate in a quantum computer model formed by a linear chain of three nuclear spins system with second neighbor Ising interaction between them. We compare with the behavior of the Markovian counterpart for temperature different from zero (thermalization) and at zero temperature for low and high dissipation rates. At low dissipation there is a very small difference between Markovian and quasi no-Markovian at any temperature which is unlikely to be measured, and at high dissipation there is a difference which is likely to be measured at any temperature.

Douglas F. G. Santiago, Renato Portugal, Nolmar Melo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1566  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that nonadditive quantum codes are more optimal for error correction when compared to stabilizer codes. The class of codeword stabilized codes (CWS) provides tools to obtain new nonadditive quantum codes by reducing the problem to finding nonlinear classical codes. In this work, we establish some results on the kind of non-Pauli operators that can be used as decoding observables for CWS codes and describe a procedure to obtain these observables.

**15.    Decoherent histories of quantum searching**  
Wim van Dam, Hieu D. Nguyen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1946  
<blockquote>
<p>
The theory of decoherent histories is an attempt to derive classical physics from positing only quantum laws at the fundamental level without notions of a classical apparatus or collapse of the wave-function. Searching for a marked target in a list of N items requires \Omega(N) oracle queries when using a classical computer, while a quantum computer can accomplish the same task in O{\sqrt{N}} queries using Grover's quantum algorithm. We study a closed quantum system executing Grover algorithm in the framework of decoherent histories and find it to be an exactly solvable model, thus yielding an alternate derivation of Grover's famous result. We also subject the Grover-executing computer to a generic external influence without needing to know the specifics of the Hamiltonian insofar as the histories decohere. Depending on the amount of decoherence, which is captured in our model by a single parameter related to the amount of information obtained by the environment, the search time can range from quantum to classical. Thus, we identify a key effect induced by the environment that can adversely affect a quantum computer's performance and demonstrate exactly how classical computing can emerge from quantum laws.

**16.    Coherent controllers for optical-feedback cooling of quantum oscillators**  
Ryan Hamerly, Hideo Mabuchi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2688  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the cooling performance of optical-feedback controllers for open optical and mechanical resonators in the Linear Quadratic Gaussian setting of stochastic control theory. We utilize analysis and numerical optimization of closed-loop models based on quantum stochastic differential equations to show that coherent control schemes, where we embed the resonator in an interferometer to achieve all-optical feedback, can outperform optimal measurement-based feedback control schemes in the quantum regime of low steady-state excitation number. These performance gains are attributed to the coherent controller's ability to simultaneously process both quadratures of an optical probe field without measurement or loss of fidelity, and may guide the design of coherent feedback schemes for more general problems of robust nonlinear and robust control.

**17.    Non-interacting multi-particle quantum random walks applied to the graph isomorphism problem for strongly regular graphs**  
Kenneth Rudinger, John King Gamble, Mark Wellons, Eric Bach, Mark Friesen, Robert Joynt, S. N. Coppersmith  
Phys. Rev. A 86, 022334 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2999  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the quantum dynamics of particles on graphs ("quantum random walks"), with the aim of developing quantum algorithms for determining if two graphs are isomorphic (related to each other by a relabeling of vertices). We focus on quantum random walks of multiple non-interacting particles on strongly regular graphs (SRGs), a class of graphs with high symmetry that is known to have pairs of graphs that are hard to distinguish. Previous work has already demonstrated analytically that two-particle non-interacting quantum walks cannot distinguish non-isomorphic SRGs of the same family. Here, we demonstrate numerically that three-particle non-interacting quantum walks have significant, but not universal, distinguishing power for pairs of SRGs, proving a fundamental difference between the distinguishing power of two-particle and three-particle non-interacting walks. We analytically show why this distinguishing power is possible, whereas it is forbidden for two-particle non-interacting walks. Based on sampling of SRGs with up to 64 vertices, we find no difference in the distinguishing power of bosonic and fermionic walks. In addition, we find that the four-fermion non-interacting walk has greater distinguishing power than the three-particle walks on SRGs, showing that increasing particle number increases distinguishing power. However, we also analytically show that no non-interacting walk with a fixed number of particles can distinguish all SRGs, thus demonstrating a potential fundamental difference between the distinguishing power of interacting and noninteracting walks.

**18.    Quantum Walks on Trees with Disorder: Decay, Diffusion, and Localization**  
Steven R. Jackson, Teng Jian Khoo, Frederick W. Strauch  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3178  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks have been shown to have impressive transport properties compared to classical random walks. However, imperfections in the quantum walk algorithm can destroy any quantum mechanical speed-up due to Anderson localization. We numerically study the effect of static disorder on a quantum walk on the glued trees graph. For small disorder, we find that the dominant effect is a type of quantum decay, and not quantum localization. For intermediate disorder, there is a crossover to diffusive transport, while a localization transition is observed at large disorder, in agreement with Anderson localization on the Cayley tree.

Stefan Brakhane, Wolfgang Alt, Tobias Kampschulte, Miguel Martinez-Dorantes, René Reimann, Seokchan Yoon, Artur Widera, Dieter Meschede  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3184  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate real-time feedback control of the joint spin-state of two neutral Caesium atoms inside a high finesse optical cavity. The quantum states are discriminated by their different cavity transmission levels. A Bayesian update formalism is used to estimate state occupation probabilities as well as transition rates. We stabilize the balanced two-atom mixed state, which is deterministically inaccessible, via feedback control and find very good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations. On average, the feedback loops achieves near optimal conditions by steering the system to the target state marginally exceeding the time to retrieve information about its state.

**20.    Optimally combining dynamical decoupling and quantum error correction**  
G.A. Paz-Silva, D. A. Lidar  
Scientific Reports 3, 1530 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3606  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how dynamical decoupling (DD) and quantum error correction (QEC) can be optimally combined in the setting of fault tolerant quantum computing. To this end we identify the optimal generator set of DD sequences designed to protect quantum information encoded into stabilizer subspace or subsystem codes. This generator set, comprising the stabilizers and logical operators of the code, minimizes a natural cost function associated with the length of DD sequences. We prove that with the optimal generator set the restrictive local-bath assumption used in earlier work on hybrid DD-QEC schemes, can be significantly relaxed, thus bringing hybrid DD-QEC schemes, and their potentially considerable advantages, closer to realization.

**21.    Quantum Adiabatic Markovian Master Equations**  
Tameem Albash, Sergio Boixo, Daniel A. Lidar, Paolo Zanardi  
New J. Phys. 14 (2012) 123016  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4197  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop from first principles Markovian master equations suited for studying the time evolution of a system evolving adiabatically while coupled weakly to a thermal bath. We derive two sets of equations in the adiabatic limit, one using the rotating wave (secular) approximation that results in a master equation in Lindblad form, the other without the rotating wave approximation but not in Lindblad form. The two equations make markedly different predictions depending on whether or not the Lamb shift is included. Our analysis keeps track of the various time- and energy-scales associated with the various approximations we make, and thus allows for a systematic inclusion of higher order corrections, in particular beyond the adiabatic limit. We use our formalism to study the evolution of an Ising spin chain in a transverse field and coupled to a thermal bosonic bath, for which we identify four distinct evolution phases. While we do not expect this to be a generic feature, in one of these phases dissipation acts to increase the fidelity of the system state relative to the adiabatic ground state.

Phys. Rev. A 86, 023836 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4204  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that a classical optical Fourier processor can be used for the shaping of quantum correlations between two or more photons, and the class of Fourier masks applicable in the multiphoton Fourier space is identified. This concept is experimentally demonstrated using two types of periodic phase masks illuminated with path-entangled photon pairs, a highly non-classical state of light. Applied first were sinusoidal phase masks, emulating two-particle quantum walk on a periodic lattice, yielding intricate correlation patterns with various spatial bunching and anti-bunching effects depending on the initial state. Then, a periodic Zernike-like filter was applied on top of the sinusoidal phase masks. Using this filter, phase information lost in the original correlation measurements was retrieved.

A spidernet is a graph obtained by adding large cycles to an almost regular tree and considered as an example having intermediate properties of lattices and trees in the study of discrete-time quantum walks on graphs. We introduce the Grover walk on a spidernet and its one-dimensional reduction. We derive an integral representation of the $n$-step transition amplitude in terms of the free Meixner law which appears as the spectral distribution. As an application we determine the class of spidernets which exhibit localization. Our method is based on quantum probabilistic spectral analysis of graphs.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 113601 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4442  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study photon-photon correlations and entanglement generation in a one-dimensional waveguide coupled to two qubits with an arbitrary spatial separation. We develop a novel Green function method to study vacuum-mediated qubit-qubit interactions, including both spontaneous and coherent couplings. As a result of these interactions, quantum beats appear in the second-order correlation function. We go beyond the Markovian regime and observe that such quantum beats persist much longer than the qubit life time. Using these non-Markovian processes, a high degree of long-distance entanglement can be generated, making waveguide-QED systems promising candidates for scalable quantum networking.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 170402 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4490  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general theory of non-Markovian dynamics for open quantum systems. We explore the non-Markovian dynamics by connecting the exact master equations with the non-equilibirum Green functions. Environmental back-actions are fully taken into account. The non-Markovian dynamics consists of non-exponential decays and dissipationless oscillations. Non-exponential decays are induced by the discontinuity in the imaginary part of the self-energy corrections. Dissipationless oscillations arise from band gaps or the finite band structure of spectral densities. The exact analytic solutions for various non-Markovian environments show that the non-Markovian dynamics can be largely understood from the environmental-modified spectra of the open systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
Physical theories are developed to describe phenomena in particular regimes, and generally are valid only within a limited range of scales. For example, general relativity provides an effective description of the Universe at large length scales, and has been tested from the cosmic scale down to distances as small as 10 meters. In contrast, quantum theory provides an effective description of physics at small length scales. Direct tests of quantum theory have been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the Large Hadron Collider, ${\sim} 10^{-20}$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers. Yet, such tests fall short of the scales required to investigate potentially significant physics that arises at the intersection of quantum and relativistic regimes. We propose to push direct tests of quantum theory to larger and larger length scales, approaching that of the radius of curvature of spacetime, where we begin to probe the interaction between gravity and quantum phenomena. In particular, we review a wide variety of potential tests of fundamental physics that are conceivable with artificial satellites in Earth orbit and elsewhere in the solar system, and attempt to sketch the magnitudes of potentially observable effects. The tests have the potential to determine the applicability of quantum theory at larger length scales, eliminate various alternative physical theories, and place bounds on phenomenological models motivated by ideas about spacetime microstructure from quantum gravity. From a more pragmatic perspective, as quantum communication technologies such as quantum key distribution advance into Space towards large distances, some of the fundamental physical effects discussed here may need to be taken into account to make such schemes viable.

<blockquote>
<p>
The basic features of the dynamics of open quantum systems, such as the dissipation of energy, the decay of coherences, the relaxation to an equilibrium or non-equilibrium stationary state, and the transport of excitations in complex structures are of central importance in many applications of quantum mechanics. The theoretical description, analysis and control of non-Markovian quantum processes play an important role in this context. While in a Markovian process an open system irretrievably loses information to its surroundings, non-Markovian processes feature a flow of information from the environment back to the open system, which implies the presence of memory effects and represents the key property of non-Markovian quantum behavior. Here, we review recent ideas developing a general mathematical definition for non-Markoviantiy in the quantum regime and a measure for the degree of memory effects in the dynamics of open systems which are based on the exchange of information between system and environment. We further study the dynamical effects induced by the presence of system-environment correlations in the total initial state and design suitable methods to detect such correlations through local measurements on the open system.

<p>
We consider the class of protocols that can be implemented by local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC) between two parties. In particular, we focus on the task of discriminating a known set of quantum states by LOCC. Building on the work in the paper "Quantum nonlocality without entanglement" [BDF+99], we provide a framework for bounding the amount of nonlocality in a given set of bipartite quantum states in terms of a lower bound on the probability of error in any LOCC discrimination protocol. We apply our framework to an orthonormal product basis known as the domino states and obtain an alternative and simplified proof that quantifies its nonlocality. We generalize this result for similar bases in larger dimensions, as well as the "rotated" domino states, resolving a long-standing open question [BDF+99].

**30.    Non-equilibrium transition from dissipative quantum walk to classical random walk**  
Marco Nizama, Manuel O. Cáceres  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6061  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have investigated the time-evolution of a free particle in interaction with a phonon thermal bath, using the tight-binding approach. A dissipative quantum walk can be defined and many important non-equilibrium decoherence properties can be investigated analytically. The non-equilibrium statistics of a pure initial state have been studied. Our theoretical results indicate that the evolving wave-packet shows the suppression of Anderson's boundaries (ballistic peaks) by the presence of dissipation. Many important relaxation properties can be studied quantitatively, such as von Neumann's entropy and quantum purity. In addition, we have studied Wigner's function. The time-dependent behavior of the quantum entanglement between a free particle -in the lattice- and the phonon bath has been characterized analytically. This result strongly suggests the non-trivial time-dependence of the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the system. We have established a connection between the quantum decoherence and the dissipative parameter arising from interaction with the phonon bath. The time-dependent behavior of quantum correlations has also been pointed out, showing continuous transition from quantum random walk to classical random walk, when dissipation increases.

**31.    Quantum algorithms for problems in number theory, algebraic geometry, and group theory**  
Wim van Dam, Yoshitaka Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6126  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers can execute algorithms that sometimes dramatically outperform classical computation. Undoubtedly the best-known example of this is Shor's discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers, whereas the same problem appears to be intractable on classical computers. Understanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly faster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of quantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of building a large-scale quantum computer. This article will review the current state of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms for problems with an algebraic flavor that achieve an apparent superpolynomial speedup over classical computation.

**32.    Quantum Key Distribution in the Classical Authenticated Key Exchange Framework**  
Michele Mosca, Douglas Stebila, Berkant Ustaoglu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6150  
<blockquote>
<p>
Key establishment is a crucial primitive for building secure channels: in a multi-party setting, it allows two parties using only public authenticated communication to establish a secret session key which can be used to encrypt messages. But if the session key is compromised, the confidentiality of encrypted messages is typically compromised as well. Without quantum mechanics, key establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational problem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and recorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating future algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy of past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel. Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD protocols still require authentication of classical communication, however, which is most easily achieved using computationally secure digital signature schemes. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with computationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded adversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the run of the protocol. We describe a security model for quantum key distribution based on traditional classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using our model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with computationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded adversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily compare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE protocols. This comparison illustrates in which types of adversarial environments different quantum and classical key agreement protocols can be secure.

**33.    Robust-fidelity atom-photon entangling gates in the weak-coupling regime**  
Ying Li, Leandro Aolita, Darrick E. Chang, Leong Chuan Kwek  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 160504 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6265  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a simple entangling principle based on the scattering of photons off single emitters in one-dimensional waveguides (or extremely-lossy cavities). The scheme can be applied to photonic qubits encoded in polarization or time-bin, and features a filtering mechanism that works effectively as a built-in error-correction directive. This automatically maps imperfections from weak couplings, atomic decay into undesired modes, frequency mismatches, or finite bandwidths of the incident photonic pulses, into heralded losses instead of infidelities. The scheme is thus adequate for high-fidelity maximally entangling gates even in the weak-coupling regime. These, in turn, can be directly applied to store and retrieve photonic-qubit states, thereby completing an atom-photon interface toolbox, or to sequential measurement-based quantum computations with atomic memories.

**34.    Quantum walks as a probe of structural anomalies in graphs**  
Mark Hillery, Hongjun Zheng, Edgar Feldman, Daniel Reitzner, Vladimir Buzek  
Physical Review A 85, 062325 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6298  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study how quantum walks can be used to find structural anomalies in graphs via several examples. Two of our examples are based on star graphs, graphs with a single central vertex to which the other vertices, which we call external vertices, are connected by edges. In the basic star graph, these are the only edges. If we now connect a subset of the external vertices to form a complete subgraph, a quantum walk can be used to find these vertices with a quantum speedup. Thus, under some circumstances, a quantum walk can be used to locate where the connectivity of a network changes. We also look at the case of two stars connected at one of their external vertices. A quantum walk can find the vertex shared by both graphs, again with a quantum speedup. This provides an example of using a quantum walk in order to find where two networks are connected. Finally, we use a quantum walk on a complete bipartite graph to find an extra edge that destroys the bipartite nature of the graph.

**35.    Weak Markov Processes as Linear Systems**  
Rolf Gohm  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0378  
<blockquote>
<p>
A noncommutative Fornasini-Marchesini system (a multi-variable version of a linear system) can be realized within a weak Markov process (a model for quantum evolution). For a discrete time parameter this is worked out systematically as a theory of representations of structure maps of a system by a weak process. We introduce subprocesses and quotient processes which can be described naturally by a suitable category of weak processes. A corresponding notion of cascade for processes induces a represented cascade of systems. We study the control theoretic notion of observability which turns out to be particularly interesting in connection with a cascade structure. As an application we gain new insights into stationary Markov chains where observability for the system is closely related to asymptotic completeness in the scattering theory of the chain. This motivates a general definition of asymptotic completeness in the category of weak processes.

**36.    C programs for solving the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a fully anisotropic trap**  
Dusan Vudragovic, Ivana Vidanovic, Antun Balaz, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Sadhan K. Adhikari  
Comput. Phys. Commun. 183 (2012) 2021  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1361  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present C programming language versions of earlier published Fortran programs (Muruganandam and Adhikari, Comput. Phys. Commun. 180 (2009) 1888) for calculating both stationary and non-stationary solutions of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The GP equation describes the properties of dilute Bose-Einstein condensates at ultra-cold temperatures. C versions of programs use the same algorithms as the Fortran ones, involving real- and imaginary-time propagation based on a split-step Crank-Nicolson method. In a one-space-variable form of the GP equation, we consider the one-dimensional, two-dimensional, circularly-symmetric, and the three-dimensional spherically-symmetric harmonic-oscillator traps. In the two-space-variable form, we consider the GP equation in two-dimensional anisotropic and three-dimensional axially-symmetric traps. The fully-anisotropic three-dimensional GP equation is also considered. In addition to these twelve programs, for six algorithms that involve two and three space variables, we have also developed threaded (OpenMP parallelized) programs, which allow numerical simulations to use all available CPU cores on a computer. All 18 programs are optimized and accompanied by makefiles for several popular C compilers. We present typical results for scalability of threaded codes and demonstrate almost linear speedup obtained with the new programs, allowing a decrease in execution times by an order of magnitude on modern multi-core computers.

Phys. Rev. B 85, 195463 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1462  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the coherent properties of plasmon polaritons optically excited on periodic nanostructures. The gold grains are coupled to a single mode photonic waveguide which exhibits a dramatically reduced transmission originating from the derived quantum interference. With a nonequilibrium description of Floquet-dressed polaritons we demonstrate the switching of light transmission through the waveguide due to sheer existence of intraband transitions in gold from right above the Fermi level driven by the external laser light.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3051  
<blockquote>
<p>
A scalable optical quantum information processor is likely to be a waveguide circuit with integrated sources, detectors, and either deterministic quantum-logic or quantum memory elements. With microsecond coherence times, ultrafast coherent control, and lifetime-limited transitions, semiconductor quantum-dot spins are a natural choice for the static qubits. However their integration with flying photonic qubits requires an on-chip spin-photon interface, which presents a fundamental problem: the spin-state is measured and controlled via circularly-polarised photons, but waveguides support only linear polarisation. We demonstrate here a solution based on two orthogonal photonic nanowires, in which the spin-state is mapped to a path-encoded photon, thus providing a blue-print for a scalable spin-photon network. Furthermore, for some devices we observe that the circular polarisation state is directly mapped to orthogonal nanowires. This result, which is physically surprising for a non-chiral structure, is shown to be related to the nano-positioning of the quantum-dot with respect to the photonic circuit.

<blockquote>
<p>
Waveguide resonators are crucial elements in sensitive astrophysical detectors [1] and circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) [2]. Coupled to artificial atoms in the form of superconducting qubits [3, 4], they now provide a technologically promising and scalable platform for quantum information processing tasks [2, 5-8]. Coupling these circuits, in situ, to other quantum systems, such as molecules [9, 10], spin ensembles [11, 12], quantum dots [13] or mechanical oscillators [14, 15] has been explored to realize hybrid systems with extended functionality. Here, we couple a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator to a nano-coshmechanical oscillator, and demonstrate all-microwave field controlled slowing, advancing and switching of microwave signals. This is enabled by utilizing electromechanically induced transparency [16-18], an effect analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic physics [19]. The exquisite temporal control gained over this phenomenon provides a route towards realizing advanced protocols for storage of both classical and quantum microwave signals [20-22], extending the toolbox of control techniques of the microwave field.
