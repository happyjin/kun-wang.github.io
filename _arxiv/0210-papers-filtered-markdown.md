**1.    Limit theorems and absorption problems for quantum random walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol.2, Special, pp.578-595 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210011  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we consider limit theorems, symmetry of distribution, and absorption problems for two types of one-dimensional quantum random walks determined by 2 times 2 unitary matrices using our PQRS method. The one type was introduced by Gudder in 1988, and the other type was studied intensively by Ambainis et al. in 2001. The difference between both types of quantum random walks is also clarified.

**2.    Quantum Certificate Complexity**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210020  
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a Boolean function f, we study two natural generalizations of the certificate complexity C(f): the randomized certificate complexity RC(f) and the quantum certificate complexity QC(f). Using Ambainis' adversary method, we exactly characterize QC(f) as the square root of RC(f). We then use this result to prove the new relation R0(f) = O(Q2(f)^2 Q0(f) log n) for total f, where R0, Q2, and Q0 are zero-error randomized, bounded-error quantum, and zero-error quantum query complexities respectively. Finally we give asymptotic gaps between the measures, including a total f for which C(f) is superquadratic in QC(f), and a symmetric partial f for which QC(f) = O(1) yet Q2(f) = Omega(n/log n).

**3.    Engineering QND measurements for continuous variable quantum information processing**  
Matteo G A Paris  
Fortschr. Phys. 51, 202 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210022  
<blockquote>
<p>
A novel scheme to realize the whole class of quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of a field quadrature is suggested. The setup requires linear optical components and squeezers, and allows optimal QND measurements of quadratures, which minimize the information gain versus state disturbance trade-off.

**4.    Interferometer-Type Structures for Guided Atoms**  
R. Dumke, T. Muether, M. Volk, W. Ertmer, G. Birkl  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 220402 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210034  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate interferometer-type guiding structures for neutral atoms based on dipole potentials created by micro-fabricated optical systems. As a central element we use an array of atom waveguides being formed by focusing a red-detuned laser beam with an array of cylindrical microlenses. Combining two of these arrays, we realize X-shaped beam splitters and more complex systems like the geometries for Mach-Zehnder and Michelson-type interferometers for atoms.

**5.    Decoherence in a quantum walk on the line**  
Viv Kendon, Ben Tregenna  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210047  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied how decoherence affects a quantum walk on the line. As expected, it is highly sensitive, consisting as it does of an extremely delocalized particle. We obtain an expression for the rate at which the standard deviation falls from the quantum value as decoherence increases and show that it is proportional to the number of decoherence "events" occuring during the walk.

**6.    Dynamical localization simulated on a few qubits quantum computer**  
Giuliano Benenti, Giulio Casati, Simone Montangero, Dima L. Shepelyansky  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 052312 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210052  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a quantum computer operating with a small number of qubits can simulate the dynamical localization of classical chaos in a system described by the quantum sawtooth map model. The dynamics of the system is computed efficiently up to a time $t\geq \ell$, and then the localization length $\ell$ can be obtained with accuracy $\nu$ by means of order $1/\nu^2$ computer runs, followed by coarse grained projective measurements on the computational basis. We also show that in the presence of static imperfections a reliable computation of the localization length is possible without error correction up to an imperfection threshold which drops polynomially with the number of qubits.

**7.    The underlying digraph of a coined quantum random walk**  
Simone Severini  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210055  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a characterization of the line digraph of a regular digraph. We make use of the characterization, to show that the underlying digraph of a coined quantum random walk is a line digraph. We remark the connection between line digraphs and in-split graphs in symbolic dynamics.

**8.    A Quantum Random Walk Search Algorithm**  
Neil Shenvi, Julia Kempe, K. Birgitta Whaley  
Phys. Rev. A, Vol. 67 (5), 052307 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks on graphs have been shown to display many interesting properties, including exponentially fast hitting times when compared with their classical counterparts. However, it is still unclear how to use these novel properties to gain an algorithmic speed-up over classical algorithms. In this paper, we present a quantum search algorithm based on the quantum random walk architecture that provides such a speed-up. It will be shown that this algorithm performs an oracle search on a database of $N$ items with $O(\sqrt{N})$ calls to the oracle, yielding a speed-up similar to other quantum search algorithms. It appears that the quantum random walk formulation has considerable flexibility, presenting interesting opportunities for development of other, possibly novel quantum algorithms.

**9.    An information-theoretic analysis of Grover's algorithm**  
Erdal Arikan  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210068  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover discovered a quantum algorithm for identifying a target element in an unstructured search universe of N items in approximately square-root of N queries to a quantum oracle, thus achieving a square-root speed-up over classical algorithms. We present an information-theoretic analysis of Grover's algorithm and show that the square-root speed-up is the best attainable result using Grover's oracle.

**10.    Combined Error Correction Techniques for Quantum Computing Architectures**  
Mark S. Byrd, Daniel A. Lidar  
Journal of Modern Optics, vol. 50, pg. 1285, (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210072  
<blockquote>
<p>
Proposals for quantum computing devices are many and varied. They each have unique noise processes that make none of them fully reliable at this time. There are several error correction/avoidance techniques which are valuable for reducing or eliminating errors, but not one, alone, will serve as a panacea. One must therefore take advantage of the strength of each of these techniques so that we may extend the coherence times of the quantum systems and create more reliable computing devices. To this end we give a general strategy for using dynamical decoupling operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may be of any form; of particular importance are decoherence-free subspaces and quantum error correction codes. We then give means for empirically determining an appropriate set of dynamical decoupling operations for a given experiment. Using these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive encoding solution to many of the problems of quantum computing proposals which use exchange-type interactions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace and an efficient set of dynamical decoupling operations. It also addresses the problems of controllability in solid state quantum dot devices.

**11.    Linear optical implementation of a single mode quantum filter and generation of multi-photon polarization entangled state**  
XuBo Zou, K. Pahlke, W. Mathis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210096  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme to implement a single-mode quantum filter, which selectively eliminates the one-photon state in a quantum state $\alpha|0>+\beta|1>+\gamma|2>$. The vacuum state and the two photon state are transmitted without any change. This scheme requires single-photon sources, linear optical elements and photon detectors. Furthermore we demonstrate, how this filter can be used to realize a two-qubit projective measurement and to generate multi-photon polarization entangled states.

**12.    Operator-Schmidt decomposition of the quantum Fourier transform on C^N1 tensor C^N2**  
Jon Tyson  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 6485-6491  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210100  
<blockquote>
<p>
Operator-Schmidt decompositions of the quantum Fourier transform on C^N1 tensor C^N2 are computed for all N1, N2 > 1. The decomposition is shown to be completely degenerate when N1 is a factor of N2 and when N1>N2. The first known special case, N1=N2=2^n, was computed by Nielsen in his study of the communication cost of computing the quantum Fourier transform of a collection of qubits equally distributed between two parties. [M. A. Nielsen, PhD Thesis, University of New Mexico (1998), Chapter 6, arXiv:quant-ph/0011036.] More generally, the special case N1=2^n1<2^n2=N2 was computed by Nielsen et. al. in their study of strength measures of quantum operations. [M.A. Nielsen et. al, (accepted for publication in Phys Rev A); arXiv:quant-ph/0208077.] Given the Schmidt decompositions presented here, it follows that in all cases the communication cost of exact computation of the quantum Fourier transform is maximal.

**13.    Characterizing the entanglement of symmetric many-particle spin-1/2 systems**  
John K. Stockton, JM Geremia, Andrew C. Doherty, Hideo Mabuchi  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 022112 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210117  
<blockquote>
<p>
Analyzing the properties of entanglement in many-particle spin-1/2 systems is generally difficult because the system's Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of constituent particles, $N$. Fortunately, it is still possible to investigate many-particle entanglement when the state of the system possesses sufficient symmetry. In this paper, we present a practical method for efficiently computing various bipartite entanglement measures for states in the symmetric subspace and perform these calculations for $N\sim 10^3$. By considering all possible bipartite splits, we construct a picture of the multiscale entanglement in large symmetric systems. In particular, we characterize dynamically generated spin-squeezed states by comparing them to known reference states (e.g., GHZ and Dicke states) and new families of states with near-maximal bipartite entropy. We quantify the trade-off between the degree of entanglement and its robustness to particle loss, emphasizing that substantial entanglement need not be fragile.

**14.    Integrable Lattice Systems and Markov Processes**  
Sergio Albeverio, Shao-Ming Fei  
Int. J. Theor. Phys., Group Theory and Nonlinear Optics 9(2002)39-68  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210130  
<blockquote>
<p>
Lattice systems with certain Lie algebraic or quantum Lie algebraic symmetries are constructed. These symmetric models give rise to series of integrable systems. As examples the $A_n$-symmetric chain models and the SU(2)-invariant ladder models are investigated. It is shown that corresponding to these $A_n$-symmetric chain models and SU(2)-invariant ladder models there are exactly solvable stationary discrete-time (resp. continuous-time) Markov chains with transition matrices (resp. intensity matrices) having spectra which coincide with the ones of the corresponding integrable models.

**15.    Quantum Walks driven by many coins**  
Todd A. Brun, Hilary A. Carteret, Andris Ambainis  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 052317 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210161  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks have been much studied recently, largely due to their highly nonclassical behavior. In this paper, we study one possible route to classical behavior for the discrete quantum random walk on the line: the use of multiple quantum ``coins'' in order to diminish the effects of interference between paths. We find solutions to this system in terms of the single coin random walk, and compare the asymptotic limit of these solutions to numerical simulations. We find exact analytical expressions for the time-dependence of the first two moments, and show that in the long time limit the ``quantum mechanical'' behavior of the one-coin walk persists. We further show that this is generic for a very broad class of possible walks, and that this behavior disappears only in the limit of a new coin for every step of the walk.

**16.    Mean of continuous variables observable {\it via} measurement on single qubit**  
Pawel Horodecki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210163  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that mean value of any observable with bounded spectrum can be uniquely determined from binary statistics of the measurement performed on {\it single} qubit ancilla coupled to a given system. The observable structure is fully encoded in the corresponding POVM. The method is generalised to the case of distant labs paradigm and discussed in the context of entanglement detection with few local measurements. The results are also discussed in the context of quantum programming.

**17.    Quantum random walks with decoherent coins**  
Todd A. Brun, Hilary A. Carteret, Andris Ambainis  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 032304 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210180  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum random walk has been much studied recently, largely due to its highly nonclassical behavior. In this paper, we study one possible route to classical behavior for the discrete quantum walk on the line: the presence of decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk. We find exact analytical expressions for the time dependence of the first two moments of position, and show that in the long-time limit the variance grows linearly with time, unlike the unitary walk. We compare this to the results of direct numerical simulation, and see how the form of the position distribution changes from the unitary to the usual classical result as we increase the strength of the decoherence.

**18.    Universal quantum information compression and degrees of prior knowledge**  
Richard Jozsa, Stuart Presnell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210196  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a universal information compression scheme that compresses any pure quantum i.i.d. source asymptotically to its von Neumann entropy, with no prior knowledge of the structure of the source. We introduce a diagonalisation procedure that enables any classical compression algorithm to be utilised in a quantum context. Our scheme is then based on the corresponding quantum translation of the classical Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Our methods lead to a conceptually simple way of estimating the entropy of a source in terms of the measurement of an associated length parameter while maintaining high fidelity for long blocks. As a by-product we also estimate the eigenbasis of the source. Since our scheme is based on the Lempel-Ziv method, it can be applied also to target sequences that are not i.i.d.

**19.    Language is Physical**  
Paul Benioff  
Quant.Inf.Proc. 1 (2002) 495-509  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210211  
<blockquote>
<p>
Some aspects of the physical nature of language are discussed. In particular, physical models of language must exist that are efficiently implementable. The existence requirement is essential because without physical models no communication or thinking would be possible. Efficient implementability for creating and reading language expressions is discussed and illustrated with a quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into physical states are discussed as are conditions under which such a map is a Godel map. The possibility that language is also mathematical is very briefly discussed.

**20.    New Experimental Limits on Macroscopic Forces Below 100 Microns**  
Joshua C. Long, Hilton W. Chan, Allison B. Churnside, Eric A. Gulbis, Michael C. M. Varney, John C. Price  
Letter version published in Nature 421, 922-925 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0210004  
<blockquote>
<p>
Results of an experimental search for new macroscopic forces with Yukawa range between 5 and 500 microns are presented. The experiment uses 1 kHz mechanical oscillators as test masses with a stiff conducting shield between them to suppress backgrounds. No signal is observed above the instrumental thermal noise after 22 hours of integration time. These results provide the strongest limits to date between 10 and 100 microns, improve on previous limits by as much as three orders of magnitude, and rule out half of the remaining parameter space for predictions of string-inspired models with low-energy supersymmetry breaking. New forces of four times gravitational strength or greater are excluded at the 95% confidence level for interaction ranges between 200 and 500 microns.
