**1.    Stabilization of Quantum Information: A Unified Dynamical-Algebraic Approach**  
P. Zanardi  
Macroscopic Quantum Coherence and Quantum Computing, A. V. Averin, B. Ruggiero and P. Silvestrini (Eds), Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publisher, New York (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203008  
<blockquote>
<p>
The notion of symmetry is shown to be at the heart of all error correction/avoidance strategies for preserving quantum coherence of an open quantum system S e.g., a quantum computer. The existence of a non-trivial group of symmetries of the dynamical algebra of S provides state-space sectors immune to decoherence. Such noiseless sectors, that can be viewed as a noncommutative version of the pointer basis, are shown to support universal quantum computation and to be robust against perturbations. When the required symmetry is not present one can generate it artificially resorting to active symmetrization procedures.

**2.    Quantum computer architecture for fast entropy extraction**  
Andrew M. Steane  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203047  
<blockquote>
<p>
If a quantum computer is stabilized by fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC), then most of its resources (qubits and operations) are dedicated to the extraction of error information. Analysis of this process leads to a set of central requirements for candidate computing devices, in addition to the basic ones of stable qubits and controllable gates and measurements. The logical structure of the extraction process has a natural geometry and hierarchy of communication needs; a computer whose physical architecture is designed to reflect this will be able to tolerate the most noise. The relevant networks are dominated by quantum information transport, therefore to assess a computing device it is necessary to characterize its ability to transport quantum information, in addition to assessing the performance of conditional logic on nearest neighbours and the passive stability of the memory. The transport distances involved in QEC networks are estimated, and it is found that a device relying on swap operations for information transport must have those operations an order of magnitude more precise than the controlled gates of a device which can transport information at low cost.

**3.    Quantum-optical communication rates through an amplifying random medium**  
J. Tworzydlo, C. W. J. Beenakker  
Phys.Rev.Lett. 89, 043902 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203094  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the competing effects of stimulated and spontaneous emission on the information capacity of an amplifying disordered waveguide. At the laser threshold the capacity reaches a "universal" limit, independent of the degree of disorder. Whether or not this limit is larger or smaller than the capacity without amplification depends on the disorder, as well as on the input power. Explicit expressions are obtained for heterodyne detection of coherent states, and generalized for arbitrary detection scheme.

**4.    Optimal parameter estimation of depolarizing channel**  
Masahide Sasaki, Masashi Ban, Stephen M. Barnett  
Phys. Rev. A66, 022308 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203113  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate strategies for estimating a depolarizing channel for a finite dimensional system. Our analysis addresses the double optimization problem of selecting the best input probe state and the measurement strategy that minimizes the Bayes cost of a quadratic function. In the qubit case, we derive the Bayes optimal strategy for any finite number of input probe particles when bipartite entanglement can be formed in the probe particles.

**5.    Experimental Implementation of the Quantum Random-Walk Algorithm**  
Jiangfeng Du, Hui Li, Xiaodong Xu, Mingjun Shi, Jihui Wu, Xianyi Zhou, Rongdian Han  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 042316 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203120  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum random walk is a possible approach to construct new quantum algorithms. Several groups have investigated the quantum random walk and experimental schemes were proposed. In this paper we present the experimental implementation of the quantum random walk algorithm on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer. We observe that the quantum walk is in sharp contrast to its classical counterpart. In particular, the properties of the quantum walk strongly depends on the quantum entanglement.

**6.    Electromagnetic Transition in Waveguide with Application to Lasers**  
Wu-Sheng Dai, Mi Xie  
Euro. Phys. J. D19 (2002) 125  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0203132  
<blockquote>
<p>
The electromagnetic transition of two-level atomic systems in a waveguide is calculated. Compared with the result in free space, the spontaneous emission rate decrease because the phase space is smaller, and meanwhile, some resonance appears in some cases. Moreover, the influence of non-uniform electromagnetic field in a waveguide on absorption and stimulated emission is considered. Applying the results to lasers, a method to enhance the laser power is proposed.

**7.    Short-Time Decoherence and Deviation from Pure Quantum States**  
Vladimir Privman  
Mod. Phys. Lett. B 16, 459-465 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203039  
<blockquote>
<p>
In systems considered for quantum computing, i.e., for control of quantum dynamics with the goal of processing information coherently, decoherence and deviation from pure quantum states, are the main obstacles to fault-tolerant error correction. At low temperatures, usually assumed in quantum computing designs, some of the accepted approaches to evaluation of relaxation mechanisms break down. We develop a new general formalism for estimation of decoherence at short times, appropriate for evaluation of quantum computing architectures.

**8.    Exact c-number Representation of Non-Markovian Quantum Dissipation**  
J. Stockburger, H. Grabert  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 170407 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203193  
<blockquote>
<p>
The reduced dynamics of a quantum system interacting with a linear heat bath finds an exact representation in terms of a stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. All memory effects of the reservoir are transformed into noise correlations and mean-field friction. The classical limit of the resulting stochastic dynamics is shown to be a generalized Langevin equation, and conventional quantum state diffusion is recovered in the Born--Markov approximation. The non-Markovian exact dynamics, valid at arbitrary temperature and damping strength, is exemplified by an application to the dissipative two-state system.

**9.    Quantum Multibaker Maps: Extreme Quantum Regime**  
Daniel K. Wojcik, J. R. Dorfman  
Phys. Rev. E 66, 036110 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203494  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a family of models for quantum mechanical, one-dimensional random walks, called quantum multibaker maps (QMB). These are Weyl quantizations of the classical multibaker models previously considered by Gaspard, Tasaki and others. Depending on the properties of the phases parametrizing the quantization, we consider only two classes of the QMB maps: uniform and random. Uniform QMB maps are characterized by phases which are the same in every unit cell of the multibaker chain. Random QMB maps have phases that vary randomly from unit cell to unit cell. The eigenstates in the former case are extended while in the latter they are localized. In the uniform case and for large $\hbar$, analytic solutions can be obtained for the time dependent quantum states for periodic chains and for open chains with absorbing boundary conditions. Steady state solutions and the properties of the relaxation to a steady state for a uniform QMB chain in contact with ``particle'' reservoirs can also be described analytically. The analytical results are consistent with, and confirmed by, results obtained from numerical methods. We report here results for the deep quantum regime (large $\hbar$) of the uniform QMB, as well as some results for the random QMB. We leave the moderate and small $\hbar$ results as well as further consideration of the other versions of the QMB for further publications.

**10.    Decay of the Loschmidt Echo for quantum states with sub-Planck scale structures**  
Ph. Jacquod, I. Adagideli, C.W.J. Beenakker  
Phys.Rev.Lett. 89, 154103 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0203052  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum states extended over a large volume in phase space have oscillations from quantum interferences in their Wigner distribution on scales smaller than $\hbar$ [W.H. Zurek, Nature {\bf 412}, 712 (2001)]. We investigate the influence of those sub-Planck scale structures on the sensitivity to an external perturbation of the state's time evolution. While we do find an accelerated decay of the Loschmidt Echo for an extended state in comparison to a localized wavepacket, the acceleration is described entirely by the classical Lyapunov exponent and hence cannot originate from quantum interference.
