**1.    Continuous-time quantum walks on the threshold network model**  
Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno  
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Vol.20, pp.1079-1090 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0055  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that many real world networks have the power-law degree distribution (scale-free property). However there are no rigorous results for continuous-time quantum walks on such realistic graphs. In this paper, we analyze space-time behaviors of continuous-time quantum walks and random walks on the threshold network model which is a reasonable candidate model having scale-free property. We show that the quantum walker exhibits localization at the starting point, although the random walker tends to spread uniformly.

**2.    Search on a Hypercubic Lattice using a Quantum Random Walk: I. d>2**  
Apoorva Patel, Md. Aminoor Rahaman  
Phys. Rev. A82 (2010) 032330  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0065  
<blockquote>
<p>
Random walks describe diffusion processes, where movement at every time step is restricted to only the neighbouring locations. We construct a quantum random walk algorithm, based on discretisation of the Dirac evolution operator inspired by staggered lattice fermions. We use it to investigate the spatial search problem, i.e. finding a marked vertex on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. The restriction on movement hardly matters for $d>2$, and scaling behaviour close to Grover's optimal algorithm (which has no restriction on movement) can be achieved. Using numerical simulations, we optimise the proportionality constants of the scaling behaviour, and demonstrate the approach to that for Grover's algorithm (equivalent to the mean field theory or the $d\to\infty$ limit). In particular, the scaling behaviour for $d=3$ is only about 25% higher than the optimal $d\to\infty$ value.

**3.    Compactly packaged superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with an optical cavity for multichannel system**  
Shigehito Miki, Masanori Takeda, Mikio Fujiwara, Masahide Sasaki, Zhen Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0226  
<blockquote>
<p>
We developed superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with an optical cavity (OC-SNSPDs) for multichannel systems. For efficient coupling, the devices were installed in compact fiber-coupled packages after their substrate thickness was reduced from 400 to 45 $\mu$m. The measured detection efficiency (DE) measurement at different substrate thicknesses and the estimation of optical coupling efficiency indicated that ~98% of the input light beam could be radiated on a 15x15 $\mu m^2$ nanowire area from behind the substrate. The DEs of a NbN OC-SNSPD system were observed to be 9.5% and 25% at 1550 nm and 1310 nm, respectively (dark-count rate: 100 c/s).

**4.    Duality of privacy amplification against quantum adversaries and data compression with quantum side information**  
Joseph M. Renes  
Proc. Roy. Soc. A vol. 467 no. 2130, pp. 1604-1623, 8 June 2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0703  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the tasks of privacy amplification against quantum adversaries and data compression with quantum side information are dual in the sense that the ability to perform one implies the ability to perform the other. These are two of the most important primitives in classical information theory, and are shown to be connected by complementarity and the uncertainty principle in the quantum setting. Applications include a new uncertainty principle formulated in terms of smooth min- and max-entropies, as well as new conditions for approximate quantum error correction.

**5.    Reference frame independent quantum key distribution**  
Anthony Laing, Valerio Scarani, John G. Rarity, Jeremy L. O'Brien  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 012304 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1050  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a quantum key distribution protocol based on pairs of entangled qubits that generates a secure key between two partners in an environment of unknown and slowly varying reference frame. A direction of particle delivery is required, but the phases between the computational basis states need not be known or fixed. The protocol can simplify the operation of existing setups and has immediate applications to emerging scenarios such as earth-to-satellite links and the use of integrated photonic waveguides. We compute the asymptotic secret key rate for a two-qubit source, which coincides with the rate of the six-state protocol for white noise. We give the generalization of the protocol to higher-dimensional systems and detail a scheme for physical implementation in the three dimensional qutrit case.

**6.    Diverse classical walking of a single atom in an amplitude-modulated standing wave lattice**  
Lin Zhang, H.Y.Kong, S.X.Qu  
Chin. J. Phys., 49(3) 759-776, 2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1074  
<blockquote>
<p>
The classical walking behaviors of a single atom in an amplitude-modulated standing wave lattice beyond the internal dynamics are investigated. Based on a simple effective model, we identify a diversity of dynamic regimes of atomic motion by periodically adjusting the lattice depth. Harmonic oscillation or pendulum rotation with classical step-jumping, random scattering walking, chaotic transportation, quasi-periodic trapped motion and roughly ballistic free flying are found in this simple model within different parametric regions by approximate analyses. Our study demonstrates a complex motion of single atom in modulating optical lattice beyond the quantum description.

**7.    Approximate Quantum Error Correction via Complementary Observables**  
Joseph M. Renes  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1150  
<blockquote>
<p>
The breakthrough of quantum error correction brought with it the picture of quantum information as a sort of combination of two complementary types of classical information, "amplitude" and "phase". Here I show how this intuition can be used to construct two new conditions for approximate quantum error correction. The first states that entanglement is locally recoverable from a bipartite state when one system can be used to approximately predict the outcomes of two complementary observables on the other. The second, more in the spirit of the recent decoupling approach, states that entanglement is locally recoverable when the environment cannot reliably predict either.

**8.    Using boundary methods to compute the Casimir energy**  
F.C. Lombardo, F.D. Mazzitelli, P.I. Villar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2011  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss new approaches to compute numerically the Casimir interaction energy for waveguides of arbitrary section, based on the boundary methods traditionally used to compute eigenvalues of the 2D Helmholtz equation. These methods are combined with the Cauchy's theorem in order to perform the sum over modes. As an illustration, we describe a point-matching technique to compute the vacuum energy for waveguides containing media with different permittivities. We present explicit numerical evaluations for perfect conducting surfaces in the case of concentric corrugated cylinders and a circular cylinder inside an elliptic one.

**9.    Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Anderson-localized Modes**  
Luca Sapienza, Henri Thyrrestrup, S?ren Stobbe, Pedro David Garcia, Stephan Smolka, Peter Lodahl  
Science 327, 1352 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2525  
<blockquote>
<p>
A major challenge in quantum optics and quantum information technology is to enhance the interaction between single photons and single quantum emitters. Highly engineered optical cavities are generally implemented requiring nanoscale fabrication precision. We demonstrate a fundamentally different approach in which disorder is used as a resource rather than a nuisance. We generate strongly confined Anderson-localized cavity modes by deliberately adding disorder to photonic crystal waveguides. The emission rate of a semiconductor quantum dot embedded in the waveguide is enhanced by a factor of 15 on resonance with the Anderson-localized mode and 94 % of the emitted single-photons couple to the mode. Disordered photonic media thus provide an efficient platform for quantum electrodynamics offering an approach to inherently disorder-robust quantum information devices.

**10.    Non-Markovian Beables vs. Massive Parallelism**  
Eric Dennis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3192  
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple dynamical model over a discrete classical state space is presented. In a certain limit, it reduces to one in a class of models subsuming Bell's field-theoretic version of Bohmian mechanics. But it exhibits the massive parallelism native to quantum mechanics only as an emergent phenomenon, in contrast with Bell's and other hidden variable theories. While still non-local in its dynamics, the model thus restores our ability to regard a system as a combination of separate, localized parts, at the price of admitting non-Markovian dynamics.

**11.    Zero-error channel capacity and simulation assisted by non-local correlations**  
Toby S. Cubitt, Debbie Leung, William Matthews, Andreas Winter  
IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, Volume 57, Issue 8, pages 5509 - 5523 (Aug 2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3195  
<blockquote>
<p>
Shannon's theory of zero-error communication is re-examined in the broader setting of using one classical channel to simulate another exactly, and in the presence of various resources that are all classes of non-signalling correlations: Shared randomness, shared entanglement and arbitrary non-signalling correlations. Specifically, when the channel being simulated is noiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by the various classes of non-signalling correlations. When the resource channel is noiseless, it results in the "reverse" problem of simulating a noisy channel exactly by a noiseless one, assisted by correlations. In both cases, 'one-shot' separations between the power of the different assisting correlations are exhibited. The most striking result of this kind is that entanglement can assist in zero-error communication, in stark contrast to the standard setting of communicaton with asymptotically vanishing error in which entanglement does not help at all. In the asymptotic case, shared randomness is shown to be just as powerful as arbitrary non-signalling correlations for noisy channel simulation, which is not true for the asymptotic zero-error capacities. For assistance by arbitrary non-signalling correlations, linear programming formulas for capacity and simulation are derived, the former being equal (for channels with non-zero unassisted capacity) to the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity originally derived by Shannon to upper bound the unassisted zero-error capacity. Finally, a kind of reversibility between non-signalling-assisted capacity and simulation is observed, mirroring the famous "reverse Shannon theorem".

**12.    Extraction of the beta-factor for single quantum dots coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide**  
Henri Thyrrestrup, Luca Sapienza, Peter Lodahl  
Appl. Phys. Lett. 96, 231106 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3346  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present measurements of the beta-factor, describing the coupling efficiency of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dots into a photonic crystal waveguide mode. The beta-factor is evaluated by means of time-resolved frequency-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. The emission wavelength of single quantum dots is temperature tuned across the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide and the spontaneous emission rate is recorded. Decay rates up to 5.7 ns^(-1), corresponding to a Purcell factor of 5.2, are measured and beta-factors up to 85% are extracted. These results prove the potential of photonic crystal waveguides in the realization of on-chip single-photon sources.

**13.    Quantum Correlations in Two-Particle Anderson Localization**  
Yoav Lahini, Yaron Bromberg, D. N. Christodoulides, Yaron Silberberg  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 163905 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3657  
<blockquote>
<p>
We predict the quantum correlations between non-interacting particles evolving simultaneously in a disordered medium. While the particle density follows the single-particle dynamics and exhibits Anderson localization, the two-particle correlation develops unique features that depend on the quantum statistics of the particles and their initial separation. On short time scales, the localization of one particle becomes dependent on whether the other particle is localized or not. On long time scales, the localized particles show oscillatory correlations within the localization length. These effects can be observed in Anderson localization of non-classical light and ultra-cold atoms.

**14.    Lieb-Robinson Bound and Locality for General Markovian Quantum Dynamics**  
David Poulin  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 190401 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3675  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Lieb-Robinson bound shows the existence of a maximum speed of signal propagation in discrete quantum mechanical systems with local interactions. This generalizes the concept of relativistic causality beyond field theory, and provides a powerful tool in theoretical condensed matter physics and quantum information science. Here, we extend the scope of this seminal result by considering general Markovian quantum evolution, where we prove that an equivalent bound holds. In addition, we use the generalized bound to demonstrate that correlations in the stationary state of a Markov process decay on a length-scale set by the Lieb-Robinson velocity and the system's relaxation time.

**15.    Simulating sparse Hamiltonians with star decompositions**  
Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari  
Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication, and Cryptography (TQC 2010), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6519, pp. 94-103 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3683  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient algorithm for simulating the time evolution due to a sparse Hamiltonian. In terms of the maximum degree d and dimension N of the space on which the Hamiltonian H acts for time t, this algorithm uses (d^2(d+log* N)||Ht||)^{1+o(1)} queries. This improves the complexity of the sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm of Berry, Ahokas, Cleve, and Sanders, which scales like (d^4(log* N)||Ht||)^{1+o(1)}. To achieve this, we decompose a general sparse Hamiltonian into a small sum of Hamiltonians whose graphs of non-zero entries have the property that every connected component is a star, and efficiently simulate each of these pieces.

**16.    Phenomenological memory-kernel master equations and time-dependent Markovian processes**  
L. Mazzola, E.-M. Laine, H.-P. Breuer, S. Maniscalco, J. Piilo  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 062120 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3817  
<blockquote>
<p>
Do phenomenological master equations with memory kernel always describe a non-Markovian quantum dynamics characterized by reverse flow of information? Is the integration over the past states of the system an unmistakable signature of non-Markovianity? We show by a counterexample that this is not always the case. We consider two commonly used phenomenological integro-differential master equations describing the dynamics of a spin 1/2 in a thermal bath. By using a recently introduced measure to quantify non-Markovianity [H.-P. Breuer, E.-M. Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)] we demonstrate that as far as the equations retain their physical sense, the key feature of non-Markovian behavior does not appear in the considered memory kernel master equations. Namely, there is no reverse flow of information from the environment to the open system. Therefore, the assumption that the integration over a memory kernel always leads to a non-Markovian dynamics turns out to be vulnerable to phenomenological approximations. Instead, the considered phenomenological equations are able to describe time-dependent and uni-directional information flow from the system to the reservoir associated to time-dependent Markovian processes.

**17.    Invariance of the bit error rate in the ancilla-assisted homodyne detection**  
Yuhsuke Yoshida, Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4055  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigated the minimum achievable bit error rate of discriminating binary coherent states by homodyne measurements with the help of arbitrary ancilla states coupled via beam splitters. We took into account arbitrary pure ancillary states those were updated in real-time by those partial measurements and classical feedforward operations where the partial measurements were made by homodyne detections with a common fixed phase. It was shown that the minimum bit error rate of the system was invariant under these operations. We also discussed how generalize the homodyne detection beyond the scheme which made the bit error rate invariant.

Advanced quantum information science and technology (QIST) applications place exacting de- mands on optical components. Quantum waveguide circuits offer a route to scalable QIST on a chip.

In this study we bring these two technologies together. Using SSPDs we observe a two-photon interference visibility of 92.3\pm1.0% in a silica-on-silicon waveguide directional coupler at \lamda = 804 nm-higher than that measured with silicon detectors (89.9\pm0.3%). We further operated controlled-NOT gate and quantum metrology circuits with SSPDs. These demonstrations present a clear path to telecom-wavelength quantum waveguide circuits.

**19.    Relationship Between Quantum Walk and Relativistic Quantum Mechanics**  
C. M. Chandrashekar, Subhashish Banerjee, R. Srikanth  
Phys. Rev. A, 81, 062340 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4656  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk models have been used as an algorithmic tool for quantum computation and to describe various physical processes. This paper revisits the relationship between relativistic quantum mechanics and the quantum walks. We show the similarities of the mathematical structure of the decoupled and coupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to that of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, respectively. In the latter case, the coin emerges as an analog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled form of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the decoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schrodinger form. By showing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible, and that the Dirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that the relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of information. However, decoherence (modelled by projective measurements on position space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk irreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time. Lieb-Robinson bound is used to highlight the causal structure of the quantum walk to put in perspective the relativistic structure of quantum walk, maximum speed of the walk propagation and the earlier findings related to the finite spread of the walk probability distribution. We also present a two-dimensional quantum walk model on a two state system to which the study can be extended.

For this purpose we propose a versatile on-chip photonic waveguide setup.

**21.    Weak Decoupling Duality and Quantum Identification**  
Patrick Hayden, Andreas Winter  
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 58(7):4914-4929, 2012  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4994  
<blockquote>
<p>
If a quantum system is subject to noise, it is possible to perform quantum error correction reversing the action of the noise if and only if no information about the system's quantum state leaks to the environment. In this article, we develop an analogous duality in the case that the environment approximately forgets the identity of the quantum state, a weaker condition satisfied by epsilon-randomizing maps and approximate unitary designs. Specifically, we show that the environment approximately forgets quantum states if and only if the original channel approximately preserves pairwise fidelities of pure inputs, an observation we call weak decoupling duality. Using this tool, we then go on to study the task of using the output of a channel to simulate restricted classes of measurements on a space of input states. The case of simulating measurements that test whether the input state is an arbitrary pure state is known as equality testing or quantum identification. An immediate consequence of weak decoupling duality is that the ability to perform quantum identification cannot be cloned. We furthermore establish that the optimal amortized rate at which quantum states can be identified through a noisy quantum channel is equal to the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of the channel, despite the fact that the task is quantum, not classical, and entanglement-assistance is not allowed. In particular, this rate is strictly positive for every non-constant quantum channel, including classical channels.

Cavities embedded in photonic crystal waveguides offer a promising route towards large scale integration of coupled resonators for quantum electrodynamics applications. In this letter, we demonstrate a strongly coupled system formed by a single quantum dot and such a photonic crystal cavity. The resonance originating from the cavity is clearly identified from the photoluminescence mapping of the out-of-plane scattered signal along the photonic crystal waveguide. The quantum dot exciton is tuned towards the cavity mode by temperature control. A vacuum Rabi splitting of ~ 140 \mueV is observed at resonance.

Apoorva Patel, K.S. Raghunathan, Md. Aminoor Rahaman  
Phys. Rev.A82:032331, 2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5564  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the spatial search problem on the two-dimensional square lattice, using the Dirac evolution operator discretised according to the staggered lattice fermion formalism. $d=2$ is the critical dimension for the spatial search problem, where infrared divergence of the evolution operator leads to logarithmic factors in the scaling behaviour. As a result, the construction used in our accompanying article \cite{dgt2search} provides an $O(\sqrt{N}\log N)$ algorithm, which is not optimal. The scaling behaviour can be improved to $O(\sqrt{N\log N})$ by cleverly controlling the massless Dirac evolution operator by an ancilla qubit, as proposed by Tulsi \cite{tulsi}. We reinterpret the ancilla control as introduction of an effective mass at the marked vertex, and optimise the proportionality constants of the scaling behaviour of the algorithm by numerically tuning the parameters.

We perform Ramsey spectroscopy on the ground state of ultra-cold 87Rb atoms magnetically trapped on a chip in the Knudsen regime. Field inhomogeneities over the sample should limit the 1/e contrast decay time to about 3 s, while decay times of 58 s are actually observed. We explain this surprising result by a spin self-rephasing mechanism induced by the identical spin rotation effect originating from particle indistinguishability. We propose a theory of this synchronization mechanism and obtain good agreement with the experimental observations. The effect is general and susceptible to appear in other physical systems.

Kwong Wa Chang, C. K. Law  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5975  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive an exact non-Markovian master equation that generalizes the previous work [Hu, Paz and Zhang, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 45}, 2843 (1992)] to damped harmonic oscillators with time-varying parameters. This is achieved by exploiting the linearity of the system and operator solution in Heisenberg picture. Our equation governs the non-Markovian quantum dynamics when the system is modulated by external devices. As an application, we apply our equation to parity kick decoupling problems. The time-dependent dissipative coefficients in the master equation are shown to be modified drastically when the system is driven by $\pi$ pulses. For coherence protection to be effective, our numerical results indicate that kicking period should be shorter than memory time of the bath. The effects of using soft pulses in an ohmic bath are also discussed.

The main aim of this thesis is to look for a logical deductive calculus (we will adopt sequent calculus, originally introduced in Gentzen, 1935), which could describe quantum information and its properties.

To do so, we had to introduce the new connective "quantum superposition", in the logic of one qubit, Lq, as the classical conjunction cannot describe this quantum link.

The packaged SNSPD device was cooled to 2.96 K within a thermal fluctuation range of 10 mK. An SNSPD with an area of 20 x 20 $\mu m^2$ showed good system detection efficiency (DE) at 100 Hz dark count rate of 2.6% and 4.5% at wavelengths of 1550 and 1310 nm, respectively. An SNSPD with an area of 10 x 10 $\mu m^2$ and kinetic inductance lower than that of the large area device showed good system DE of 2.6% at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The SNSPD system could be operated for over 10 h with constant system DE and dark count rate.

<p>
The quantum walk was originally proposed as a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical random walk, and has since become a powerful tool in quantum information science. In this paper, we show that discrete time quantum walks provide a versatile platform for studying topological phases, which are currently the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation. In particular, we demonstrate that recent experimental realizations of quantum walks simulate a non-trivial one dimensional topological phase. With simple modifications, the quantum walk can be engineered to realize all of the topological phases which have been classified in one and two dimensions. We further discuss the existence of robust edge modes at phase boundaries, which provide experimental signatures for the non-trivial topological character of the system.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1822  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study discrete-time quantum walks on one-dimensional lattices. We find that the coherent dynamics depends on the initial states and coin parameters. For infinite size of lattice, we derive an explicit expression for the return probability, which shows scaling behavior $P(0,t)\sim t^{-1}$ and does not depends on the initial states of the walk. In the long-time limit, the probability distribution shows various patterns, depending on the initial states, coin parameters and the lattice size. The average mixing time $M_{\epsilon}$ closes to the limiting probability in linear $N$ (size of the lattice) for large values of thresholds $\epsilon$. Finally, we introduce another kind of quantum walk on infinite or even-numbered size of lattices, and show that the walk is equivalent to the traditional quantum walk with symmetrical initial state and coin parameter.

<p>
We propose a method to generate a two-dimensional cluster state of polarization encoded photonic qubits from two coupled quantum dot emitters. We combine the recent proposal [N. H. Lindner and T. Rudolph, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 113602 (2009)] for generating 1-dimensional cluster state strings from a single dot, with a new proposal for an optically induced conditional phase (CZ) gate between the two quantum dots. The entanglement between the two quantum dots translates to entanglement between the two photonic cluster state strings. Further inter-pair coupling of the quantum dots using cavities and waveguides can lead to a 2-dimensional cluster sheet. Detailed analysis of errors indicates that our proposal is feasible with current tech- nology. Crucially, the emitted photons need not have identical frequencies, and so there are no constraints on the resonance energies for the quantum dots, a standard problem for such sources.

Thorough control of quantum measurement is key to the development of quantum information technologies. Many measurements are destructive, removing more information from the system than they obtain. Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements allow repeated measurements that give the same eigenvalue. They could be used for several quantum information processing tasks such as error correction, preparation by measurement, and one-way quantum computing. Achieving QND measurements of photons is especially challenging because the detector must be completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring information about them. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in superconducting circuits has increased demand for a QND detector which operates in the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate a QND detection scheme which measures the number of photons inside a high quality-factor microwave cavity on a chip. This scheme maps a photon number onto a qubit state in a single-shot via qubit-photon logic gates. We verify the operation of the device by analyzing the average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that it is 90% QND. It differs from previously reported detectors because its sensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states. This scheme could be used to monitor the state of a photon-based memory in a quantum computer.

<p>
Loss is a crucial problem in plasmonic integrated optical circuits and metamaterials. The Er, Yb codoped gain material is introduced into a magnetic plasmon waveguide composed of a chain of nanosandwiches in order to solve the loss problem in such subwavelength waveguide. The magnetic plasmon mode and a higher order mode are chosen as the signal and pump light to enhance the radiation and pump efficiencies. The signal light propagating in the waveguide is investigated with different Er3+ doping concentration and signal decay time. It is shown that the gain effect can not only compensate the loss but also is able to amplify the signal, when exceeding certain threshold values of doping concentration and signal decay time.

<p>
Investigation at a $\phi$--factory can shed light on several debated issues in particle physics. We discuss: i) recent theoretical development and experimental progress in kaon physics relevant for the Standard Model tests in the flavor sector, ii) the sensitivity we can reach in probing CPT and Quantum Mechanics from time evolution of entangled kaon states, iii) the interest for improving on the present measurements of non-leptonic and radiative decays of kaons and eta/eta$^\prime$ mesons, iv) the contribution to understand the nature of light scalar mesons, and v) the opportunity to search for narrow di-lepton resonances suggested by recent models proposing a hidden dark-matter sector. We also report on the $e^+ e^-$ physics in the continuum with the measurements of (multi)hadronic cross sections and the study of gamma gamma processes.

We study the dynamics of neutral cold atoms in an $L$-shaped crossed-beam optical waveguide formed by two perpendicular red-detuned lasers of different intensities and a blue-detuned laser at the corner. Complemented with a vibrational cooling process this setting works as a one-way device or "atom diode".

**35.    Toward a Broadband Astro-comb: Effects of Nonlinear Spectral Broadening in Optical Fibers**  
Guoqing Chang, Chih-Hao Li, David F. Phillips, Ronald L. Walsworth, Franz X. K?rtner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4680  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze a new approach to generate a broadband astro-comb by spectral broadening of a narrowband astro-comb inside a highly nonlinear optical fiber. Numerical modeling shows that cascaded four-wave-mixing dramatically degrades the input comb's side-mode suppression and causes side-mode amplitude asymmetry. These two detrimental effects can systematically shift the center-of-gravity of astro-comb spectral lines as measured by an astrophysical spectrograph with resolution \approx100,000; and thus lead to wavelength calibration inaccuracy and instability. Our simulations indicate that this performance penalty, as a result of nonlinear spectral broadening, can be compensated by using a filtering cavity configured for double-pass. As an explicit example, we present a design based on an Yb-fiber source comb (with 1 GHz repetition rate) that is filtered by double-passing through a low finesse cavity (finesse = 208), and subsequent spectrally broadened in a 2-cm, SF6-glass photonic crystal fiber. Spanning more than 300 nm with 16 GHz line spacing, the resulting astro-comb is predicted to provide 1 cm/s (~10 kHz) radial velocity calibration accuracy for an astrophysical spectrograph. Such extreme performance will be necessary for the search for and characterization of Earth-like extra-solar planets, and in direct measurements of the change of the rate of cosmological expansion.

**36.    Non-Markovian theory of vibrational energy relaxation and its applications to biomolecular systems**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4796  
<blockquote>
<p>
Energy transfer (relaxation) phenomena are ubiquitous in nature. At a macroscopic level, the phenomenological theory of heat (Fourier law) successfully describes heat transfer and energy flow. However, its microscopic origin is still under debate. This is because the phenomena can contain many-body, multi-scale, nonequilibrium, and even quantum mechanical aspects, which present significant challenges to theories addressing energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology. In this paper, we describe our recent theoretical attempts to treat vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in biomolecular systems, including peptide, porphyrin, and protein. First we construct a reduced model using (instantaneous) normal mode analysis, and further add anharmonic coupling between vibrational modes. Using such a model combined with time-dependent perturbation theory for the anharmonic coupling, we derive non-Markovian VER formulas, which are applicable to small timescales such as sub picoseconds. We apply the VER formulas with full atomistic detail to various biomolecular systems, discuss the VER timescales and mechanisms, and compare with experiment if possible. We finally mention further theoretical prospects of the energy transfer phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a versatile and compact electron beam driven source for alkali metal atoms, which can be implemented in cryostats. With a heat load of less than 10mW, the heat dissipation normalized to the atoms loaded into the magneto-optical Trap (MOT), is about a factor 1000 smaller than for a typical alkali metal dispenser. The measured linear scaling of the MOT loading rate with electron current observed in the experiments, indicates that electron stimulated desorption is the corresponding mechanism to release the atoms.

R. Burioni, L. Caniparoli, A. Vezzani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2161  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study L\'evy walks in quenched disordered one-dimensional media, with scatterers spaced according to a long-tailed distribution. By analyzing the scaling relations for the random-walk probability and for the resistivity in the equivalent electric problem, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement as a function of the exponent characterizing the scatterers distribution. We demonstrate that in quenched media different average procedures can display different asymptotic behavior. In particular, we estimate the moments of the displacement averaged over processes starting from scattering sites, in analogy with recent experiments. Our results are compared with numerical simulations, with excellent agreement.

Phys. Rev. B 81, 155117 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5698  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel scheme of realizing an optical diode at the few-photon level. The system consists of a one-dimensional waveguide coupled asymmetrically to a two-level system. The two or multi-photon transport in this system is strongly correlated. We derive exactly the single and two-photon current and show that the two-photon current is asymmetric for the asymmetric coupling. Thus the system serves as an optical diode which allows transmission of photons in one direction much more efficiently than the opposite.
