**1.    Method for decoupling error correction from privacy amplification**  
Hoi-Kwong Lo  
New Journal of Physics 5, 36 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201030  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement purification provides a unifying framework for proving the security of quantum key distribution schemes. Nonetheless, up till now, a local commutability constraint in the CSS code construction means that the error correction and privacy amplification procedures of BB84 are not fully decoupled. Here, I provide a method to decouple the two processes completely. The method requires Alice and Bob to share some initial secret string and use it to encrypt the bit-flip error syndrome using one-time-pad encryption. As an application, I prove the unconditional security of the interactive Cascade protocol, proposed by Brassard and Salvail for error correction, modified by one-time-pad encryption of the error syndrome, and followed by the random matrix protocol for privacy amplification. This is an efficient protocol in terms of both computational power and key generation rate.

**2.    Heisenberg's Introduction of the `Collapse of the Wavepacket' into Quantum Mechanics**  
R. Y. Chiao, P. G. Kwiat  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201036  
<blockquote>
<p>
Heisenberg in 1929 introduced the "collapse of the wavepacket" into quantum theory. We review here an experiment at Berkeley which demonstrated several aspects of this idea. In this experiment, a pair of daughter photons was produced in an entangled state, in which the sum of their two energies was equal to the sharp energy of their parent photon, in the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The wavepacket of one daughter photon collapsed upon a measurement-at-a-distance of the other daughter's energy, in such a way that the total energy of the two-photon system was conserved. Heisenberg's energy-time uncertainty principle was also demonstrated to hold in this experiment.

**4.    Imperfect Detectors in Linear Optical Quantum Computers**  
Scott Glancy, J. M. LoSecco, H. M. Vasconcelos, C. E. Tanner  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 062317 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201047  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the effects of imperfect photon detectors suffering from loss and noise on the reliability of linear optical quantum computers. We show that for a given detector efficiency, there is a maximum achievable success probability, and that increasing the number of ancillary photons and detectors used for one controlled sign flip gate beyond a critical point will decrease the probability that the computer will function correctly. We have also performed simulations of some small logic gates and estimate the efficiency and noise levels required for the linear optical quantum computer to function properly.

**5.    A family of sure-success quantum algorithms for solving a generalized Grover search problem**  
Chia-Ren Hu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201049  
<blockquote>
<p>
This work considers a generalization of Grover's search problem, viz., to find any one element in a set of acceptable choices which constitute a fraction f of the total number of choices in an unsorted data base. An infinite family of sure-success quantum algorithms are introduced here to solve this problem, each member for a different range of f. The nth member of this family involves n queries of the data base, and so the lowest few members of this family should be very convenient algorithms within their ranges of validity. The even member {A}_{2n} of the family covers ever larger range of f for larger n, which is expected to become the full range 0 <= f <= 1 in the limit n -->infinity.

**6.    Quantum Information Theory and Applications to Quantum Cryptography**  
Nikolaos P. Papadakos  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201057  
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical and quantum information theory are simply explained. To be more specific it is clarified why Shannon entropy is used as measure of classical information and after a brief review of quantum mechanics it is possible to demonstrate why the density matrix is the main tool of quantum information theory. Then von Neumann entropy is introduced and with its help a great difference between classical and quantum information theory is presented: quantum entanglement. Moreover an information theoretic interpretation of quantum measurement is discussed. Data compression, error correction and noisy channel transmission are simply demonstrated for both classical and quantum cases. Finally using the above theory quantum cryptography is reviewed and the possibility of a commercial device realizing it is explored.

<blockquote>
<p>
We define an approximate version of the Fourier transform on $2^L$ elements, which is computationally attractive in a certain setting, and which may find application to the problem of factoring integers with a quantum computer as is currently under investigation by Peter Shor.

**10.    Demonstration of the Lateral Casimir Force**  
F. Chen, U. Mohideen, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. Lett., v.88, N10, p.101801-(1-4), 2002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201087  
<blockquote>
<p>
The lateral Casimir force between a sinusoidally corrugated gold coated plate and large sphere was measured for surface separations between 0.2 $\mu$m to 0.3 $\mu$m using an atomic force microscope. The measured force shows the required periodicity corresponding to the corrugations. It also exhibits the necessary inverse fourth power distance dependence. The obtained results are shown to be in good agreement with a complete theory taking into account the imperfectness of the boundary metal. This demonstration opens new opportunities for the use of the Casimir effect for lateral translation in microelectromechanical systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a numerical algorithm for finding optimal measurements for quantum-state discrimination. The theory of the semidefinite programming provides a simple check of the optimality of the numerically obtained results.

**12.    Implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform and Simulation of Wave Functions by Fixed Interaction**  
Yuri Ozhigov  
Pis'ma v ZhETF, 2002, vol. 76, iss. 10, pp. 746-751  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201132  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a quantum computer with fixed and permanent interaction of diagonal type between qubits. It is controlled only by one-qubit quick transformations. It is shown how to implement Quantum Fourier Transform and to solve Shroedinger equations with linear and quadratic potentials by a quantum computer of such type. The method is adaptable to the wide range of interactions of diagonal form between qubits and to the case when different pairs of qubits interact variously.

**13.    On the role of entanglement in quantum computational speed-up**  
Richard Jozsa, Noah Linden  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201143  
<blockquote>
<p>
For any quantum algorithm operating on pure states we prove that the presence of multi-partite entanglement, with a number of parties that increases unboundedly with input size, is necessary if the quantum algorithm is to offer an exponential speed-up over classical computation. Furthermore we prove that the algorithm can be classically efficiently simulated to within a prescribed tolerance \eta even if a suitably small amount of global entanglement (depending on \eta) is present. We explicitly identify the occurrence of increasing multi-partite entanglement in Shor's algorithm. Our results do not apply to quantum algorithms operating on mixed states in general and we discuss the suggestion that an exponential computational speed-up might be possible with mixed states in the total absence of entanglement. Finally, despite the essential role of entanglement for pure state algorithms, we argue that it is nevertheless misleading to view entanglement as a key resource for quantum computational power.

**14.    Bayesian feedback versus Markovian feedback in a two-level atom**  
H. M. Wiseman, Stefano Mancini, Jin Wang  
PRA 66, 013807 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201145  
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare two different approaches to the control of the dynamics of a continuously monitored open quantum system. The first is Markovian feedback as introduced in quantum optics by Wiseman and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70}, 548 (1993)]. The second is feedback based on an estimate of the system state, developed recently by Doherty {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 012105 (2000)]. Here we choose to call it, for brevity, {\em Bayesian feedback}. For systems with nonlinear dynamics, we expect these two methods of feedback control to give markedly different results. The simplest possible nonlinear system is a driven and damped two-level atom, so we choose this as our model system. The monitoring is taken to be homodyne detection of the atomic fluorescence, and the control is by modulating the driving. The aim of the feedback in both cases is to stabilize the internal state of the atom as close as possible to an arbitrarily chosen pure state, in the presence of inefficient detection and other forms of decoherence. Our results (obtain without recourse to stochastic simulations) prove that Bayesian feedback is never inferior, and is usually superior, to Markovian feedback. However it would be far more difficult to implement than Markovian feedback and it loses its superiority when obvious simplifying approximations are made. It is thus not clear which form of feedback would be better in the face of inevitable experimental imperfections.

**15.    Counter-propagating entangled photons from a waveguide with periodic nonlinearity**  
Mark C. Booth, Mete Atature, Giovanni Di Giuseppe, Alexander V. Sergienko, Bahaa E. A. Saleh, Malvin C. Teich  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 023815 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201150  
<blockquote>
<p>
The conditions required for spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a waveguide with periodic nonlinearity in the presence of an unguided pump field are established. Control of the periodic nonlinearity and the physical properties of the waveguide permits the quasi-phase matching equations that describe counter-propagating guided signal and idler beams to be satisfied. We compare the tuning curves and spectral properties of such counter-propagating beams to those for co-propagating beams under typical experimental conditions. We find that the counter-propagating beams exhibit narrow bandwidth permitting the generation of quantum states that possess discrete-frequency entanglement. Such states may be useful for experiments in quantum optics and technologies that benefit from frequency entanglement.

**16.    Single Ion Implantation for Solid State Quantum Computer Development**  
T. Schenkel, J. P. Holder, J. W. McDonald, J. Meijer, A. Persaud, D. H. Schneider  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0201549  
<blockquote>
<p>
Several solid state quantum computer schemes are based on the manipulation of electron and nuclear spins of single donor atoms in a solid matrix. The fabrication of qubit arrays requires the placement of individual atoms with nanometer precision and high efficieny. In this article we describe first results from low dose, low energy implantations and our development of a low energy (<10keV), single ion implantation scheme for 31P(q+) ions. When 31P(q+) ions impinge on a wafer surface, their potential energy (9.3 keV for P15+) is released, and about 20 secondary electrons are emitted. The emission of multiple secondary electrons allows detection of each ion impact with 100% efficiency. The beam spot on target is controlled by beam focusing and collimation. Exactly one ion is implanted into a selected area avoiding a Poissonian distribution of implanted ions.
