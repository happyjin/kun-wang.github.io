**1.    Symmetries in discrete time quantum walks on Cayley graphs**  
VÃ¡clav Poto?ek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0172  
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the question of symmetries of an important type of quantum walks. We introduce all the necessary definitions and provide a rigorous formulation of the problem. Using a thorough analysis, we reach the complete answer by presenting a constructive method of finding all solutions of the problem with minimal additional assumptions. We apply the results on an example of a quantum walk on a line to demonstrate the practical significance of the theory.

**2.    Perfect State Transfer on Signed Graphs**  
J. Brown, C. Godsil, D. Mallory, A. Raz, C. Tamon  
Quantum Information and Computation, vol. 13, no. 5&6, pages 511-530, 2013  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0505  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study perfect state transfer of quantum walks on signed graphs. Our aim is to show that negative edges are useful for perfect state transfer. Specific results we prove include: (1) The signed join of a negative 2-clique with any positive (n,3)-regular graph has perfect state transfer even if the unsigned join does not. Curiously, the perfect state transfer time improves as n increases. (2) A signed complete graph has perfect state transfer if its positive subgraph is a regular graph with perfect state transfer and its negative subgraph is periodic. This shows that signing is useful for creating perfect state transfer since no complete graph (except for the 2-clique) has perfect state transfer. (3) The double-cover of a signed graph has perfect state transfer if the positive subgraph has perfect state transfer and the negative subgraph is periodic. Here, signing is useful for constructing unsigned graphs with perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on a family of signed graphs called the exterior powers which is derived from a many-fermion quantum walk on graphs.

**3.    Superlinear advantage for exact quantum algorithms**  
Andris Ambainis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0721  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum algorithm is exact if, on any input data, it outputs the correct answer with certainty (probability 1). A key question is: how big is the advantage of exact quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts: deterministic algorithms. For total Boolean functions in the query model, the biggest known gap was just a factor of 2: PARITY of N inputs bits requires $N$ queries classically but can be computed with N/2 queries by an exact quantum algorithm. We present the first example of a Boolean function f(x_1, ..., x_N) for which exact quantum algorithms have superlinear advantage over the deterministic algorithms. Any deterministic algorithm that computes our function must use N queries but an exact quantum algorithm can compute it with O(N^{0.8675...}) queries.

**4.    Enhancing pseudo-telepathy in the Magic Square game**  
?ukasz Pawela, Piotr Gawron, Zbigniew Pucha?a, Jan S?adkowski  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1213  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the possibility of reversing an action of a quantum channel. Our principal objective is to find a specific channel that reverses as accurately as possible an action of a given quantum channel. To achieve this goal we use semidefinite programming. We show the benefits of our method using the quantum pseudo-telepathy Magic Square game with noise. Our strategy is to move the pseudo-telepathy region to higher noise values. We show that it is possible to reverse the action of a noise channel using semidefinite programming.

**5.    Fourier Transform Quantum State Tomography**  
Mohammadreza Mohammadi, Agata M. Branczyk, Daniel F. V. James  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 012117 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1399  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a technique for performing quantum state tomography of photonic polarization-encoded multi-qubit states. Our method uses a single rotating wave plate, a polarizing beam splitter and two photon-counting detectors per photon mode. As the wave plate rotates, the photon counters measure a pseudo-continuous signal which is then Fourier transformed. The density matrix of the state is reconstructed using the relationship between the Fourier coefficients of the signal and the Stokes' parameters that represent the state. The experimental complexity, i.e. different wave plate rotation frequencies, scales linearly with the number of qubits.

**6.    Entanglement engineering and topological protection by discrete-time quantum walks**  
Simon Moulieras, Maciej Lewenstein, Graciana Puentes  
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 46 (2013) 104005  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1591  
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) represent robust and versatile platforms for the controlled engineering of single particle quantum dynamics, and have attracted special attention due to their algorithmic applications in quantum information science. Even in their simplest 1D architectures, they display complex topological phenomena, which can be employed in the systematic study of topological quantum phase transitions [1]. Due to the exponential scaling in the number of resources required, most experimental realizations of QWs up to date have been limited to single particles, with only a few implementations involving correlated quantum pairs. In this article we study applications of quantum walks in the controlled dynamical engineering of entanglement in bipartite bosonic systems. We show that quantum walks can be employed in the transition from mode entanglement, where indistinguishability of the quantum particles plays a key role, to the standard type of entanglement associated with distinguishable particles. We also show that, by carefully tailoring the steps in the QWs, as well as the initial state for the quantum walker, it is possible to preserve the entanglement content by topological protection. The underlying mechanism that allows for the possibility of both entanglement engineering and entanglement protection is the strong "spin-orbit" coupling induced by the QW. We anticipate that the results reported here can be employed for the controlled emulation of quantum correlations in topological phases.

**7.    Implementing Quantum Walks Using Orbital Angular Momentum of Classical Light**  
Sandeep K Goyal, Filippus S Roux, Andrew Forbes, Thomas Konrad  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 263602 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1705  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an implementation scheme for a quantum walk in the orbital angular momentum space of a laser beam. The scheme makes use of a ring interferometer, containing a quarter-wave plate and a q plate. This setup enables one to perform an arbitrary number of quantum walk steps. In addition, the classical nature of the implementation scheme makes it possible to observe the quantum walk evolution in real time. We use nonquantum entanglement of the laser beam's polarization with its orbital angular momentum to implement the quantum walk.

**8.    Waveguide-QED-Based Photonic Quantum Computation**  
Huaixiu Zheng, Daniel J. Gauthier, Harold U. Baranger  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 090502 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1711  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new scheme for quantum computation using flying qubits--propagating photons in a one-dimensional waveguide--interacting with matter qubits. Photon-photon interactions are mediated by the coupling to a three- or four-level system, based on which photon-photon \pi-phase gates (Controlled-NOT) can be implemented for universal quantum computation. We show that high gate fidelity is possible given recent dramatic experimental progress in superconducting circuits and photonic-crystal waveguides. The proposed system can be an important building block for future on-chip quantum networks.

**9.    Work extraction via quantum nondemolition measurements of qubits in cavities: Non-Markovian effects**  
David Gelbwaser-Klimovsky, Noam Erez, Robert Alicki, Gershon Kurizki  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 022112 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1772  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that frequent nondemolition measurements of a quantum system immersed in a thermal bath allow the extraction of work in a closed cycle from the system-bath interaction (correlation) energy, a hitherto unexploited work resource. It allows for work even if no information is gathered or the bath is at zero temperature, provided the cycle is within the bath memory time. The predicted work resource may be the basis of quantum engines embedded in a bath with long memory time, such as the electromagnetic bath of a high-Q cavity coupled to two-level systems.

**10.    Quantum Communications Made Easy: Deterministic Models of Bosonic Channels**  
Graeme Smith, John A. Smolin  
Nature 504, 263-267 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1956  
<blockquote>
<p>
Information theory establishes the ultimate limits on performance for noisy communication systems [Shannon48]. An accurate model of a physical communication device must include quantum effects, but typically including these makes the theory intractable. As a result communication capacities are not known, even for transmission between two users connected by an electromagnetic waveguide subject to gaussian noise. Here we present an exactly solvable model of communications with a fully quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to find explicit expressions for all the point-to-point capacities of a noisy quantum channel, with implications for quantum key distribution, and fiber optical communications. We also develop a theory of quantum communication networks by solving some rudimentary quantum networks for broadcasting and multiple access. When possible, we compare the predictions of our new model with those of the orthodox quantum gaussian model and in all cases we find capacities in agreement to within a constant number of bits. Thus, in the limit of high signal to noise ratios our simple model captures the relevant physics of gaussian models while remaining amenable to detailed analysis,

**11.    A monolithically integrated polarization entangled photon pair source on a silicon chip**  
Nobuyuki Matsuda, Hanna Le Jeannic, Hiroshi Fukuda, Tai Tsuchizawa, William John Munro, Kaoru Shimizu, Koji Yamada, Yasuhiro Tokura, Hiroki Takesue  
Sci. Rep. 2, 817 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2885  
<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated photonic circuits are one of the most promising platforms for large-scale photonic quantum information systems due to their small physical size and stable interferometers with near-perfect lateral-mode overlaps. Since many quantum information protocols are based on qubits defined by the polarization of photons, we must develop integrated building blocks to generate, manipulate, and measure the polarization-encoded quantum state on a chip. The generation unit is particularly important. Here we show the first integrated polarization-entangled photon pair source on a chip. We have implemented the source as a simple and stable silicon-on-insulator photonic circuit that generates an entangled state with 91 \pm 2% fidelity. The source is equipped with versatile interfaces for silica-on-silicon or other types of waveguide platforms that accommodate the polarization manipulation and projection devices as well as pump light sources. Therefore, we are ready for the full-scale implementation of photonic quantum information systems on a chip.

**12.    The Measurement Based Quantum Computing Search Algorithm is Faster than Grover's Algorithm**  
A. Matthew Smith, P. M. Alsing

**13.    Is the Measurement Based Quantum Computing Search Algorithm Really Grover's Algorithm?**  
A. Matthew Smith, P. M. Alsing, J. R. McDonald, D.B. Uskov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3407  
<blockquote>
<p>
We question whether the measurement based quantum computing algorithm is in fact Grover's algorithm or simply a similar oracular search method. The two algorithms share several qualitative features especially in the case of the trivial 4 element search, which is the largest size photonic search algorithm that has been experimentally implemented to date. This has led some to refer to both substantiations as Grover's algorithm. We compare multiple features of the two algorithms including the behavior of the oracle tags and the entanglement dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We find significant and fundamental differences in the operation of the two algorithms, particularly in cases involving searches on more than four elements.

**14.    Construction of Energy Functions for Lattice Heteropolymer Models: A Case Study in Constraint Satisfaction Programming and Adiabatic Quantum Optimization**  
Ryan Babbush, Alejandro Perdomo-Ortiz, Bryan O'Gorman, William Macready, AlÃ¡n Aspuru-Guzik  
Advances in Chemical Physics: Volume 155 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3422  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optimization problems associated with the interaction of linked particles are at the heart of polymer science, protein folding and other important problems in the physical sciences. In this review we explain how to recast these problems as constraint satisfaction problems such as linear programming, maximum satisfiability, and pseudo-boolean optimization. By encoding problems this way, one can leverage substantial insight and powerful solvers from the computer science community which studies constraint programming for diverse applications such as logistics, scheduling, artificial intelligence, and circuit design. We demonstrate how to constrain and embed lattice heteropolymer problems using several strategies. Each strikes a unique balance between number of constraints, complexity of constraints, and number of variables. Finally, we show how to reduce the locality of couplings in these energy functions so they can be realized as Hamiltonians on existing quantum annealing machines. We intend that this review be used as a case study for encoding related combinatorial optimization problems in a form suitable for adiabatic quantum optimization.

**15.    Time evolution of continuous-time quantum walks on dynamical percolation graphs**  
ZoltÃ¡n DarÃ¡zs, TamÃ¡s Kiss  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 (2013) 375305  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3550  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the time evolution of continuous-time quantum walks on randomly changing graphs. At certain moments edges of the graph appear or disappear with a given probability. We focus on the case when the time interval between subsequent changes of the graph tends to zero. We derive explicit formulae for the general evolution in this limit. We find that the percolation in this limit causes an effective time rescaling. Independently of the graph and the initial state of the walk, the time is rescaled by the probability of keeping and edge. Both the individual trajectories for a single system and average properties with a superoperator formalism are discussed. We give an analytical proof for our theorem and we also present results from numerical simulations of the phenomena for different graphs.

**16.    Quantum register based on structured diamond waveguide with NV centers**  
Alexander V. Tsukanov, Igor Yu. Kateev, Alexander A. Orlikovsky  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3819  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme of quantum information processing with NV-centers embedded inside diamond nanostructure. Single NV-center placed in the cavity plays role of an electron spin qubit which evolution is controlled by microwave pulses. Besides, it couples to the cavity field via optical photon exchange. In their turn, neighbor cavities are coupled to each other through the photon hopping to form a bus waveguide mode. This waveguide mode overlaps with all NV-centers. Entanglement between distant centers is organized by appropriate tuning of their optical frequency relative to the waveguide frequency via electrostatic control without lasers. We describe the controlled-Z operation that is by one order of magnitude faster than in off-resonant laser-assisted schemes proposed earlier. Spectral characteristics of the one-dimensional chain of microdisks are calculated by means of numerical modeling, using the approach analogous to the tight-binding approximation in the solid-state physics. The data obtained allow to optimize the geometry of the microdisk array for the effective implementation of quantum operations.

**17.    Efficient single-spatial-mode periodically-poled KTiOPO_4 waveguide source for high-dimensional entanglement-based quantum key distribution**  
Tian Zhong, Franco N. C. Wong, Alessandro Restelli, Joshua C. Bienfang  
Opt. Express 20, 26868-26877 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4496  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate generation of high-purity photon pairs at 1560 nm in a single spatial mode from a periodically-poled KTiOPO_4 (PPKTP) waveguide. With nearly lossless spectral filtering, the PPKTP waveguide source shows approximately 80 % single-mode fiber coupling efficiency and is well suited for high-dimensional time-energy entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Using high-count-rate self-differencing InGaAs single-photon avalanche photodiodes configured with either square or sinusoidal gating, we achieve > 1 Mbit/s raw key generation with 3 bits-per-photon encoding, and, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported Franson quantum-interference visibility of 98.2 % without subtraction of accidental coincidences.

**18.    Mode-resolved Photon Counting via Cascaded Quantum Frequency Conversion**  
Yu-Ping Huang, Prem Kumar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4643  
<blockquote>
<p>
Resources for the manipulation and measurements of high-dimensional photonic signals are crucial for implementing qu$d$it-based applications. Here we propose potentially high-performance, chip-compatible devices for such purposes by exploiting quantum-frequency conversion in nonlinear optical media. Specifically, by using sum-frequency generation in a $\chi^{(2)}$ waveguide we show how mode-resolved photon counting can be accomplished for telecom-band photonic signals subtending multiple temporal modes. Our method is generally applicable to any nonlinear medium with arbitrary dispersion property.

**19.    On the time-optimal implementation of quantum Fourier transform for qudits represented by quadrupole nucleus**  
V. P. Shauro, V. E. Zobov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4928  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of time-optimal realization of the quantum Fourier transform gate for a single qudit with number of levels d from 3 to 8. As a qudit the quadrupole nucleus with spin I > 1/2 controlled by NMR is considered. We calculate the dependencies of the gate error on the duration of radio-frequency pulse obtained by numerical optimization using Krotov-based algorithm. It is shown that the dependences of minimum time of QFT gate implementation on qudit dimension are different for integer and half-integer spins.

**20.    Product Formulas for Exponentials of Commutators**  
Andrew M. Childs, Nathan Wiebe  
J. Math. Phys. 54, 062202 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4945  
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a recursive method for constructing product formula approximations to exponentials of commutators, giving the first approximations that are accurate to arbitrarily high order. Using these formulas, we show how to approximate unitary exponentials of (possibly nested) commutators using exponentials of the elementary operators, and we upper bound the number of elementary exponentials needed to implement the desired operation within a given error tolerance. By presenting an algorithm for quantum search using evolution according to a commutator, we show that the scaling of the number of exponentials in our product formulas with the evolution time is nearly optimal. Finally, we discuss applications of our product formulas to quantum control and to implementing anticommutators, providing new methods for simulating many-body interaction Hamiltonians.

**21.    Effects of Quantum Error Correction on Entanglement Sudden Death**  
Muhammed Y?na?, J. H. Eberly  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 14, No. 1&2 (2014) 0039-0055  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5654  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the effects of error correction on non-local quantum coherence as a function of time, extending the study by Sainz and Bj\"ork. We consider error correction of amplitude damping, pure phase damping and combinations of amplitude and phase damping as they affect both fidelity and quantum entanglement. Initial two-qubit entanglement is encoded in arbitrary real superpositions of both \Phi-type and \Psi-type Bell states. Our main focus is on the possibility of delay or prevention of ESD (early stage decoherence, or entanglement sudden death). We obtain the onset times for ESD as a function of the state-superposition mixing angle. Error correction affects entanglement and fidelity differently, and we exhibit initial entangled states for which error correction increases fidelity but decreases entanglement, and vice versa.

D.E. Chang, J.I. Cirac, H.J. Kimble  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5660  
<blockquote>
<p>
Atoms coupled to nanophotonic interfaces represent an exciting frontier for the investigation of quantum light-matter interactions. While most work has considered the interaction between statically positioned atoms and light, here we demonstrate that a wealth of phenomena can arise from the self-consistent interaction between atomic internal states, optical scattering, and atomic forces. We consider in detail the case of atoms coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide, and show that this interplay gives rise to self-organization of atomic positions along the waveguide, which can be probed experimentally through distinct characteristics of the reflection and transmission spectra.

**23.    Markovian Master Equation and Thermodynamics of Two-level System in Strong Laser Field**  
K. Szczygielski, D. Gelbwaser-Klimovsky, R. Alicki  
Phys. Rev. E87, 012120 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5665  
<blockquote>
<p>
The recently developed technique combining the weak coupling limit with the Floquet formalism is applied to a model of two-level atom driven by a strong laser field and weakly coupled to heat baths. Firstly, the case of a single electromagnetic bath at zero temperature is discussed and the formula for resonance fluorescence is derived. The expression describes the well-known Mollow triplet, but its details differ from the standard ones based on additional simplifying assumptions. The second example describes the case of two thermal reservoirs: an electromagnetic one at finite temperature and the second dephasing one, which can be realized as a phononic or buffer gas reservoir. It is shown using the developed thermodynamical approach that the latter system can work in two regimes depending on the detuning sign: a heat pump transporting heat from the dephasing reservoir to an electromagnetic bath or can heat both, always at the expense of work supplied by the laser field.

**24.    Bulk Nuclear Polarization Enhanced at Room-Temperature by Optical Pumping**  
Ran Fischer, Christian O. Bretschneider, Paz London, Dmitry Budker, David Gershoni, Lucio Frydman  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 057601 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5801  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bulk 13C polarization can be strongly enhanced in diamond at room-temperature based on the optical pumping of nitrogen-vacancy color centers. This effect was confirmed by irradiating suitably aligned single-crystals at a ~50 mT field promoting anti-crossings between electronic excited-state levels, followed by shuttling of the sample into a custom-built NMR setup and by subsequent 13C detection. A nuclear polarization of ~0.5% - equivalent to the 13C polarization achievable by thermal polarization at room temperature at fields of ~2000 T - was measured, and its bulk nature determined based on line shape and relaxation measurements. Positive and negative enhanced polarizations were obtained, with a generally complex but predictable dependence on the magnetic field during optical pumping. Owing to its simplicity, this 13C room-temperature polarizing strategy provides a promising new addition to existing nuclear hyperpolarization techniques.

<blockquote>
<p>
Optical coherent states are classical light fields with high purity, and are essential carriers of information in optical networks. If these states could be controlled in the quantum regime, allowing for their quantum superposition (referred to as a Schr\"odinger cat state), then novel quantum-enhanced functions such as coherent-state quantum computing (CSQC), quantum metrology, and a quantum repeater could be realized in the networks. Optical cat states are now routinely generated in the laboratories. An important next challenge is to use them for implementing the aforementioned functions. Here we demonstrate a basic CSQC protocol, where a cat state is used as an entanglement resource for teleporting a coherent state with an amplitude gain. We also show how this can be extended to a loss-tolerant quantum relay of multi-ary phase-shift keyed coherent states. These protocols could be useful both in optical and quantum communications.

Physical Review A 89, 043833 (2014)

<blockquote>
<p>
We compare two different models of transport of light in a disordered system with a spherical Gaussian distribution of scatterers. A coupled dipole model, keeping into account all interference effects, is compared to an incoherent model, using a random walk of particles. Besides the well known coherent backscattering effect and a well pronounced forward lobe, the incoherent model reproduces extremely well all scattering features. In an experiment with cold atoms, we use the momentum recoil imparted on the center of mass of the sample as a partial probe of the light scattering properties. We find that the force acting on the center of mass of the atoms is not well suited to exhibit the coherence effects in light propagation under multiple scattering conditions.

In this report we show that vacuum is a nonlinear optical medium and we discuss what are the optical phenomena that should exist in the framework of the standard model of particle physics. We pay special attention to the low energy limit. The predicted effects for photons of energy smaller than the electron rest mass are of such a level that none has been observed experimentally yet. Progresses in field sources and related techniques seem to indicate that in few years vacuum nonlinear optics will be accessible to human investigation.

We present a superconducting qubit design that is fabricated in a 2D geometry over a superconducting ground plane to enhance the lifetime. The qubit is coupled to a microstrip resonator for readout. The circuit is fabricated on a silicon substrate using low loss, stoichiometric titanium nitride for capacitor pads and small, shadow-evaporated aluminum/aluminum-oxide junctions. We observe qubit relaxation and coherence times ($T_1$ and $T_2$) of 11.7 $\pm$ 0.2 $\mu$s and 8.7 $\pm$ 0.3 $\mu$s, respectively. Calculations show that the proximity of the superconducting plane suppresses the otherwise high radiation loss of the qubit. A significant increase in $T_1$ is projected for a reduced qubit-to-superconducting plane separation.

Optical fibers have been enabling numerous distinguished applications involving the operation and generation of light, such as soliton transmission, light amplification, all-optical switching and supercontinuum generation. The active function of optical fibers in the quantum regime is expected to be applicable to ultralow-power all-optical signal processing and quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate the first experimental observation of optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level in an optical fiber. Taking advantage of large nonlinearity and managed dispersion of a photonic crystal fiber, we have successfully measured very small (10^(-7) ~ 10^(-8)) conditional phase shifts induced by weak coherent pulses that contain one or less than one photon per pulse on average. In spite of its tininess, the phase shift was measurable using much (~10^6 times) stronger coherent probe pulses than the pump pulses. We discuss the feasibility of quantum information processing using optical fibers, taking into account the observed Kerr nonlinearity accompanied by ultrafast response time and low induced loss.

We theoretically investigate up-conversion process of entangled two photons on a dimer molecule, which is coupled by a cavity or nanoscale metallic structure. Within one-dimensional input-output theory, the propagators of the photons are derived analytically and the up-conversion probability is calculated numerically. It is shown that the coupling with the nanostructure clearly enhances the process. We also find that the enhancement becomes further pronounced for some balanced system parameters such as the quantum correlation between photons, radiation decay rates and coupling between the nanostructure and molecule. The non-monotonic dependencies are reasonably explained in view of quantum interference between the coupled modes of the whole system. This result can provide a guideline for nonlinear optical reactions by weak light of a few photons.

<p>
Interfacing light and matter at the quantum level is at the heart of modern atomic and optical physics and enables new quantum technologies involving the manipulation of single photons and atoms. A prototypical atom-light interface is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference gives rise to hybrid states of photons and atoms called dark-state polaritons. We have observed individual dark-state polaritons as they propagate through an ultracold atomic gas involving Rydberg states. Strong long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms give rise to an effective interaction blockade for dark-state polaritons, which results in large optical nonlinearities and modified polariton number statistics. The observed statistical fluctuations drop well below the quantum noise limit indicating that photon correlations modified by the strong interactions have a significant back-action on the Rydberg atom statistics.
