**1.    Reachability Probabilities of Quantum Markov Chains**  
Shenggang Ying, Yuan Feng, Nengkun Yu, Mingsheng Ying  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0060  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper studies three kinds of long-term behaviours, namely reachability, repeated reachability and persistence, of quantum Markov chains (qMCs). As a stepping-stone, we introduce the notion of bottom strongly connected component (BSCC) of a qMC and develop an algorithm for finding BSCC decompositions of the state space of a qMC. As the major contribution, several (classical) algorithms for computing the reachability, repeated reachability and persistence probabilities of a qMC are presented, and their complexities are analysed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0304  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrated the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between two photons after visible-to-telecommunication wavelength conversion. In the experiment, we prepared a heralded single photon by using spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the other photon from a weak laser source at 780 nm. We converted the wavelength of both photons to the telecommunication wavelength of 1522 nm by using difference-frequency generation in a periodically-poled lithium niobate, and then observed the HOM interference between the photons. The observed visibility is $0.76\pm 0.12$ which clearly shows the non-classical interference of the two photons. The high-visibility interference is an important step for fiber-based quantum communications of photons generated from visible photon emitters.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0427  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on the demonstration of correlated photon pair generation in quasi-phase-matched superlattice AlGaAs waveguides with a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR); with a continuous (CW) pump, the observed CAR (>100) is more than two order of magnitudes improvement over previously reported spontaneous down conversion (SPDC) schemes in AlGaAs waveguides with a pulsed pump.

**4.    Photon Aided and Inhibited Tunneling of Photons**  
Xuele Liu, G.S. Agarwal  
Phys. Rev. A 87, 063841 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0509  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the light of the interest in the transport of single photons in arrays of waveguides, fiber couplers, photonic crystals, etc., we consider the quantum mechanical process of the tunneling of photons through evanescently or otherwise coupled structures. We specifically examine the issue of tunneling between two structures when one structure already contains few photons. We demonstrate the possibility of both photon aided and inhibited tunneling of photons. The Bosonic nature of photons enhances the tunneling probability. We also show how the multiphoton tunneling probability can be either enhanced or inhibited due to the presence of photons. We find similar results for the higher order tunneling. Finally, we show that the presence of a squeezed field changes the nature of tunneling considerably.

**5.    Silicon-on-insulator integrated source of polarization-entangled photons**  
Laurent Olislager, Jassem Safioui, Stéphane Clemmen, Kien Phan Huy, Wim Bogaerts, Roel Baets, Philippe Emplit, Serge Massar  
Published in Optics Letters, Vol. 38, No. 11, 1960 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0642  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the experimental generation of polarization-entangled photons at telecommunication wavelengths using spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon-on-insulator wire waveguides. The key component is a 2D coupler that transforms path entanglement into polarization entanglement at the output of the device. Using quantum state tomography we find that the produced state has fidelity 88% with a pure non-maximally entangled state. The produced state violates the CHSH Bell inequality by S=2.37\pm0.19.

Opt. Express 21, 8596-8604 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0843  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the generation of quantum-correlated photon pairs from a Si photonic-crystal coupled-resonator optical waveguide. A slow-light supermode realized by the collective resonance of high-Q and small-mode-volume photonic-crystal cavities successfully enhanced the efficiency of the spontaneous four-wave mixing process. The generation rate of photon pairs was improved by two orders of magnitude compared with that of a photonic-crystal line defect waveguide without a slow-light effect.

**7.    Anderson localization of entangled photons in an integrated quantum walk**

Nature Photonics 7, 322-328 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1012  
<blockquote>
<p>
Waves fail to propagate in random media. First predicted for quantum particles in the presence of a disordered potential, Anderson localization has been observed also in classical acoustics, electromagnetism and optics. Here, for the first time, we report the observation of Anderson localization of pairs of entangled photons in a two-particle discrete quantum walk a?ected by position dependent disorder. A quantum walk on a disordered lattice is realized by an integrated array of interferometers fabricated in glass by femtosecond laser writing. A novel technique is used to introduce a controlled phase shift into each unit mesh of the network. Polarization entanglement is exploited to simulate the di?erent symmetries of the two-walker system. We are thus able to experimentally investigate the genuine effect of (bosonic and fermionic) statistics in the absence of interaction between the particles. We will show how different types of randomness and the symmetry of the wave-function affect the localization of the entangled walkers.

**8.    Comparative investigation of the freezing phenomena for quantum correlations under nondissipative decoherence**  
Benjamin Aaronson, Rosario Lo Franco, Gerardo Adesso  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012120 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1163  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the phenomenon of frozen discord, exhibited by specific classes of two-qubit states under local nondissipative decoherent evolutions, is a common feature of all known bona fide measures of general quantum correlations. All those measures, despite inducing typically inequivalent orderings on the set of nonclassically correlated states, return a constant value in the considered settings. Every communication protocol which relies on quantum correlations as resource will run with a performance completely unaffected by noise in the specified dynamical conditions. We provide a geometric interpretation of this

Mátyás Koniorczyk, Lívia Dani, Vladimír Bu?ek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1326  
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply semidefinite programming for designing 1 to 2 symmetric qubit quantum cloners. These are optimized for the average fidelity of their joint output state with respect to a product of multiple originals. We design 1 to 2 quantum bit cloners using the numerical method for finding completely positive maps approximating a nonphysical one optimally. We discuss the properties of the so-designed cloners.

Nature Photonics 8, 104-108 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1490  
<blockquote>
<p>
Large-scale integrated quantum photonic technologies will require the on-chip integration of identical photon sources with reconfigurable waveguide circuits. Relatively complex quantum circuits have already been demonstrated, but few studies acknowledge the pressing need to integrate photon sources and waveguide circuits together on-chip. A key step towards such large-scale quantum technologies is the integration of just two individual photon sources within a waveguide circuit, and the demonstration of high-visibility quantum interference between them. Here, we report a silicon-on-insulator device combining two four-wave mixing sources, in an interferometer with a reconfigurable phase shifter. We configure the device to create and manipulate two-colour (non-degenerate) or same-colour (degenerate), path-entangled or path-unentangled photon pairs. We observe up to 100.0+/-0.4% visibility quantum interference on-chip, and up to 95+/-4% off-chip. Our device removes the need for external photon sources, provides a path to increasing the complexity of quantum photonic circuits, and is a first step towards fully-integrated quantum technologies.

**11.    Giant vacuum forces via transmission lines**  
Ephraim Shahmoon, Igor Mazets, Gershon Kurizki  
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 111, 10485 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2028  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum electromagnetic fluctuations induce forces between neutral particles, known as the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions. These fundamental forces, mediated by virtual photons from the vacuum, play an important role in basic physics and chemistry, and in emerging technologies involving, e.g. micro-electromechanical systems or quantum information processing. Here we show that these interactions can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude upon changing the character of the mediating vacuum-modes. By considering two polarizable particles in the vicinity of any standard electric transmission line, along which photons can propagate in one dimension (1d), we find a much stronger and longer-range interaction than in free-space. This enhancement may have profound implications on many-particle and bulk systems, and impact the quantum technologies mentioned above. The predicted giant vacuum force is estimated to be measurable in a coplanar waveguide line.

**12.    Differential Evolution for Many-Particle Adaptive Quantum Metrology**  
Neil B. Lovett, Cécile Crosnier, Martí Perarnau-Llobet, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review Letters 110, 220501 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2246  
<blockquote>
<p>
We devise powerful algorithms based on differential evolution for adaptive many-particle quantum metrology. Our new approach delivers adaptive quantum metrology policies for feedback control that are orders-of-magnitude more efficient and surpass the few-dozen-particle limitation arising in methods based on particle-swarm optimization. We apply our method to the binary-decision-tree model for quantum-enhanced phase estimation as well as to a new problem: a decision tree for adaptive estimation of the unknown bias of a quantum coin in a quantum walk and show how this latter case can be realized experimentally.

**13.    Fidelity of the surface code in the presence of a bosonic bath**  
P. Jouzdani, E. Novais, E. R. Mucciolo  
Phys. Rev. A 88, 012336 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2975  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the resilience of the surface code to decoherence caused by the presence of a bosonic bath. This approach allows us to go beyond the standard stochastic error model commonly used to quantify decoherence and error threshold probabilities in this system. The full quantum mechanical system-bath dynamics is computed exactly over one quantum error correction cycle. Since all physical qubits interact with the bath, space-time correlations between errors are taken into account. We compute the fidelity of the surface code as a function of the quantum error correction time. The calculation allows us to map the problem onto an Ising-like statistical spin model with two-body interactions and a fictitious temperature which is related to the inverse bath coupling constant. The model departs from the usual Ising model in the sense that interactions can be long ranged and can involve complex exchange couplings; in addition, the number of allowed configurations is restricted by the syndrome extraction. Using analytical estimates and numerical calculations, we argue that, in the limit of an infinite number of physical qubits, the spin model sustain a phase transition which can be associated to the existence of an error threshold in the surface code. An estimate of the transition point is given for the case of nearest-neighbor interactions.

**14.    Non-Markovianity during quantum Zeno effect**  
A. Thilagam  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3194  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in the context of non-Markovian dynamics in entangled spin-boson systems in contact with noninteracting reservoirs. We identify enhanced non-Markovian signatures in specific two-qubit partitions of a Bell-like initial state, with results showing that the intra-qubit Zeno effect or anti-Zeno effect occurs in conjunction with inter-qubit non-Markovian dynamics for a range of system parameters. The time domain of effective Zeno or anti-Zeno dynamics is about the same order of magnitude as the non-Markovian time scale of the reservoir correlation dynamics, and changes in decay rate due to the Zeno mechanism appears coordinated with information flow between specific two-qubit partitions. We extend our analysis to examine the Zeno mechanism-non-Markovianity link using the tripartite states arising from a donor-acceptor-sink model of photosynthetic biosystems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3511  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fast and efficient detection of the qubit state in trapped ion quantum information processing is critical for implementing quantum error correction and performing fundamental tests such as a loophole-free Bell test. In this work we present a simple qubit state detection protocol for a $^{171}$Yb$^+$ hyperfine atomic qubit trapped in a microfabricated surface trap, enabled by high collection efficiency of the scattered photons and low background photon count rate. We demonstrate average detection times of 10.5, 28.1 and 99.8\,$\upmu$s, corresponding to state detection fidelities of 99%, 99.85(1)% and 99.915(7)%, respectively.

**16.    Interaction of Independent Single Photons based on Integrated Nonlinear Optics**

Nature Communications 4, 2324 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3630  
<blockquote>
<p>
Photons are ideal carriers of quantum information, as they can be easily created and can travel long distances without being affected by decoherence. For this reason, they are well suited for quantum communication. However, the interaction between single photons is negligible under most circumstances. Realising such an interaction is not only fundamentally fascinating but holds great potential for emerging technologies. It has recently been shown that even weak optical nonlinearities between single photons can be used to perform important quantum communication tasks more efficiently than methods based on linear optics, which have fundamental limitations. Nonlinear optical effects at single photon levels in atomic media have been studied and demonstrated but these are neither flexible nor compatible with quantum communication as they impose restrictions on photons' wavelengths and bandwidths. Here we use a high efficiency nonlinear waveguide to observe the sum-frequency generation between a single photon and a single-photon level coherent state from two independent sources. The use of an integrated, room-temperature device and telecom wavelengths makes this approach to photon-photon interaction well adapted to long distance quantum communication, moving quantum nonlinear optics one step further towards complex quantum networks and future applications such as device independent quantum key distribution.

**17.    Unveiling and exemplifying the unitary equivalence of discrete time quantum walk models**

Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 46, 165302 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3690  
<blockquote>
<p>
The two major discrete time formulations for quantum walks, coined and scattering, are unitarily equivalent for arbitrary position dependent transition amplitudes and any topology (PRA {\bf 80}, 052301 (2009)). Although the proof explicit describes the mapping obtention, its high technicality may hinder relevant physical aspects involved in the equivalence. Discussing concrete examples -- the most general constructions for the line, square and honeycomb lattices -- here we unveil the similarities and differences of these two versions of quantum walks. We moreover show how to derive the dynamics of one from the other by means of proper projections. We perform calculations for different probability amplitudes like, Hadamard, Grover, Discrete Fourier Transform and the uncommon in the area (but interesting) Discrete Hartley Transform, comparing the evolutions. Our study illustrates the models interplay, an important issue for implementations and applications of such systems.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 103, 063504, (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3693  
<blockquote>
<p>
The addition of nonlinearity to an harmonic resonator provides a route to complex dynamical behaviour of resonant modes, including coupling between them. We present a superconducting device that makes use of the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions to introduce a controlled, tunable, nonlinear inductance to a thin film coplanar waveguide resonator. Considering the device as a potential quantum optical component in the microwave regime, we create a sensitive bifurcation amplifier and then demonstrate spectroscopy of other resonant modes via the intermode coupling. We find that the sensitivity of the device approaches within a factor two quantitative agreement with a quantum model by Dykman, but is limited by a noise that has its source(s) on-chip.

**19.    Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with only transversal gates and error correction**  
Adam Paetznick, Ben W. Reichardt  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 090505 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3709  
<blockquote>
<p>
Transversal implementations of encoded unitary gates are highly desirable for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Though transversal gates alone cannot be computationally universal, they can be combined with specially distilled resource states in order to achieve universality. We show that "triorthogonal" stabilizer codes, introduced for state distillation by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], admit transversal implementation of the controlled-controlled-Z gate. We then construct a universal set of fault-tolerant gates without state distillation by using only transversal controlled-controlled-Z, transversal Hadamard, and fault-tolerant error correction. We also adapt the distillation procedure of Bravyi and Haah to Toffoli gates, improving on existing Toffoli distillation schemes.

Operating reconfigurable quantum circuits with single photon sources is a key goal of photonic quantum information science and technology. We use an integrated waveguide device comprising of directional couplers and a reconfigurable thermal phase controller to manipulate single photons emitted from a chromium related colour centre in diamond. Observation of both a wave-like interference pattern and particle-like sub-Poissionian autocorrelation functions demonstrates coherent manipulation of single photons emitted from the chromium related centre and verifies wave particle duality.

**21.    Steady-State Entanglement by Engineered Quasi-Local Markovian Dissipation**  
Francesco Ticozzi, Lorenza Viola  
Quantum Information and Computation, 14 (3-4), 0265-0294, 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4270  
<blockquote>
<p>
We characterize and construct time-independent Markovian dynamics that drive a finite-dimensional multipartite quantum system into a target (pure) entangled steady state, subject to physical locality constraints. In situations where the desired stabilization task can not be attained solely based on local dissipative means, we allow for local Hamiltonian control or, if the latter is not an option, we suitably restrict the set of admissible initial states. In both cases, we provide algorithms for constructing a master equation that achieves the intended objective and show how this can genuinely extend the manifold of stabilizable states. In particular, we present quasi-local control protocols for dissipatively engineering multipartite GHZ "cat" states and W states on $n$ qubits. For GHZ states, we find that no scalable procedure exists for achieving stabilization from arbitrary initial states, whereas this is possible for a target W state by a suitable combination of a two-body Hamiltonian and dissipators. Interestingly, for both entanglement classes, we show that quasi-local stabilization may be scalably achieved conditional to initialization of the system in a large, appropriately chosen subspace.

**22.    Easy and hard functions for the Boolean hidden shift problem**

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4642  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the quantum query complexity of the Boolean hidden shift problem. Given oracle access to f(x+s) for a known Boolean function f, the task is to determine the n-bit string s. The quantum query complexity of this problem depends strongly on f. We demonstrate that the easiest instances of this problem correspond to bent functions, in the sense that an exact one-query algorithm exists if and only if the function is bent. We partially characterize the hardest instances, which include delta functions. Moreover, we show that the problem is easy for random functions, since two queries suffice. Our algorithm for random functions is based on performing the pretty good measurement on several copies of a certain state; its analysis relies on the Fourier transform. We also use this approach to improve the quantum rejection sampling approach to the Boolean hidden shift problem.

<blockquote>
<p>
Creating miniature chip scale implementations of optical quantum information protocols is a dream for many in the quantum optics community. This is largely because of the promise of stability and scalability. Here we present a monolithically integratable chip architecture upon which is built a photonic device primitive called a Bragg reflection waveguide (BRW). Implemented in gallium arsenide, we show that, via the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion, the BRW is capable of directly producing polarization entangled photons without additional path difference compensation, spectral filtering or post-selection. After splitting the twin-photons immediately after they emerge from the chip, we perform a variety of correlation tests on the photon pairs and show non-classical behaviour in their polarization. Combined with the BRW's versatile architecture our results signify the BRW design as a serious contender on which to build large scale implementations of optical quantum processing devices.

<p>
We describe a chip-scale, telecommunications-band frequency conversion interface designed for low-noise operation at wavelengths desirable for common single photon emitters. Four-wave mixing Bragg scattering in silicon nitride waveguides is used to demonstrate frequency upconversion and downconversion between the 980 nm and 1550 nm wavelength regions, with signal-to-background levels >10 and conversion efficiency of approximately -60 dB at low continuous wave input pump powers (<50 mW). Finite element simulations and the split-step Fourier method indicate that increased input powers of approximately 10 W (produced by amplified nanosecond pulses, for example) will result in a conversion efficiency >25 % in existing geometries. Finally, we present waveguide designs that can be used to connect shorter wavelength (637 nm to 852 nm) quantum emitters with 1550 nm.

<blockquote>
<p>
We implement an ultrafast pulsed type-II parametric down conversion source in a periodically poled KTP waveguide at telecommunication wavelengths with almost identical properties between signal and idler. As such, our source resembles closely a pure, genuine single mode photon pair source with indistinguishable modes. We measure the joint spectral intensity distribution and second order correlation functions of the marginal beams and find with both methods very low effective mode numbers corresponding to a Schmidt number below 1.16. We further demonstrate the indistinguishability as well as the purity of signal and idler photons by Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences between signal and idler and between signal/idler and a coherent field, respectively. Without using narrowband spectral filtering, we achieve a visibility for the interference between signal and idler of 94.8% and determine a purity of more than 80% for the heralded single photon states. Moreover, we measure raw heralding efficiencies of 20.5% and 15.5% for the signal and idler beams corresponding to detector-loss corrected values of 80% and 70%.

<p>
We present a microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap with a pair of integrated waveguides that generate a standing microwave field resonant with the 171Yb+ hyperfine qubit. The waveguides are engineered to position the wave antinode near the center of the trap, resulting in maximum field amplitude and uniformity along the trap axis. By calibrating the relative amplitudes and phases of the waveguide currents, we can control the polarization of the microwave field to reduce off-resonant coupling to undesired Zeeman sublevels. We demonstrate single-qubit pi-rotations as fast as 1 us with less than 6 % variation in Rabi frequency over an 800 um microwave interaction region. Fully compensating pulse sequences further improve the uniformity of X-gates across this interaction region.

We study the generation and evolution of entanglement between two qubits coupled through one-dimensional waveguide modes.

We show that when the qubit-waveguide coupling is increased, the Markov approximation is not anymore valid, and the generation of entanglement is worsened.

<p>
It was claimed (Lloyd et al., PRL 108 (2012) 074802) that energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) with electron vortex beams is feasible, and has even advantages over the standard setup with Bragg diffracted waves. In this Comment, we show that Lloyd et al. ignored an important constraint on the proposed selection rule for the transfer of angular momentum in the interaction, namely that it is only valid for an atom located in the very center of the vortex. As an experimental consequence, the EMCD signal will only be strong for extremely small nanoparticles of 1 to 2 nm diameter.

<p>
We design and fabricate two types of superconducting niobium coplanar waveguide microwave resonators with different coupling capacitors on high purity Si substrates. Their microwave transmissions are measured at the temperatures of 20 mK. It is found that these two types of resonators possess significantly-different loaded quality factors; one is $5.6\times{10}^{3}$, and the other is $4.0\times{10}^{4}$. The measured data are fitted well by classical ABCD matrix approach. We found that the transmission peak deviates from the standard Lorentizian with a frequency broadening.

<blockquote>
<p>
The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum algorithms.

<p>
Toida et al. claim in their recent article [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 066802 (2013)] that they `report a direct observation of vacuum Rabi splitting in a GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot (DQD) based charge qubit coupled with a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator'. In this comment, we challenge the main claims made in their paper and show that their results: a) do not provide any evidence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and b) do not provide any direct evidence of vacuum Rabi splitting.

<blockquote>
<p>
Combating the detrimental effects of noise remains a major challenge in realizing a scalable quantum computer. To help to address this challenge, we introduce a model realizing a controllable qubit-bath coupling using a sequence of LC resonators. The model establishes a strong coupling to a low-temperature environment which enables us to lower the effective qubit temperature making ground state initialization more efficient. The operating principle is similar to that of a recently proposed coplanar-waveguide cavity (CPW) system, for which our work introduces a complementary and convenient experimental realization. The lumped-element model utilized here provides an easily accessible theoretical description. We present analytical solutions for some experimentally feasible parameter regimes and study the control mechanism. Finally, we introduce a mapping between our model and the recent CPW system.

**35.    Power-law scaling of asymmetries in viscous flow with PT-symmetric inflow and outflow**

<blockquote>
<p>
In recent years, open systems with balanced loss and gain, that are invariant under the combined parity and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) operations, have been studied via asymmetries of their solutions. They represent systems as diverse as coupled optical waveguides and electrical or mechanical oscillators. We numerically investigate the asymmetries of incompressible viscous flow in two and three dimensions with "balanced" inflow-outflow ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) configurations. By introducing configuration-dependent classes of asymmetry functions in velocity, kinetic energy density, and vorticity fields, we find that the flow asymmetries exhibit power-law scaling with a single exponent in the laminar regime with the Reynolds number ranging over four decades. We show that such single-exponent scaling is expected for small Reynolds numbers, although its robustness at large values of Reynolds numbers is unexpected. Our results imply that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric inflow-outflow configurations provide a hitherto unexplored avenue to tune flow properties.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quipper is a recently developed programming language for expressing quantum computations. This paper gives a brief tutorial introduction to the language, through a demonstration of how to make use of some of its key features. We illustrate many of Quipper's language features by developing a few well known examples of Quantum computation, including quantum teleportation, the quantum Fourier transform, and a quantum circuit for addition.

<blockquote>
<p>
The efficient evaluation of tensor expressions involving sums over multiple indices is of significant importance to many fields of research, including quantum many-body physics, loop quantum gravity, and quantum chemistry. The computational cost of evaluating an expression may depend strongly upon the order in which the index sums are evaluated, and determination of the operation-minimising contraction sequence for a single tensor network (single term, in quantum chemistry) is known to be NP-hard. The current preferred solution is an exhaustive search, using either an iterative depth-first approach with pruning or dynamic programming and memoisation, but these approaches are impractical for many of the larger tensor network Ansaetze encountered in quantum many-body physics. We present a modified search algorithm with enhanced pruning which exhibits a performance increase of several orders of magnitude while still guaranteeing identification of an optimal operation-minimising contraction sequence for a single tensor network. A reference implementation for MATLAB, compatible with the ncon() and multienv() network contractors of arXiv:1402.0939 and arXiv:1310.8023 respectively, is supplied.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that supersymmetry can provide a versatile platform in synthesizing a new class of optical structures with desired properties and functionalities. By exploiting the intimate relationship between superpatners, one can systematically construct index potentials capable of exhibiting the same scattering and guided wave characteristics. In particular, in the Helmholtz regime, we demonstrate that one-dimensional supersymmetric pairs display identical reflectivities and transmittivities for any angle of incidence. Optical SUSY is then extended to two-dimensional systems where a link between specific azimuthal mode subsets is established. Finally we explore supersymmetric photonic lattices where discreteness can be utilized to design lossless integrated mode filtering arrangements.
