**1.    Multiparticle entanglement purification for two-colorable graph states**  
H. Aschauer, W. Dür, H.-J. Briegel  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 012319 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405045  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate multiparticle entanglement purification schemes which allow one to purify all two colorable graph states, a class of states which includes e.g. cluster states, GHZ states and codewords of various error correction codes. The schemes include both recurrence protocols and hashing protocols. We analyze these schemes under realistic conditions and observe for a generic error model that the threshold value for imperfect local operations depends on the structure of the corresponding interaction graph, but is otherwise independent of the number of parties. The qualitative behavior can be understood from an analytically solvable model which deals only with a restricted class of errors. We compare direct multiparticle entanglement purification protocols with schemes based on bipartite entanglement purification and show that the direct multiparticle entanglement purification is more efficient and the achievable fidelity of the purified states is larger. We also show that the purification protocol allows one to produce private entanglement, an important aspect when using the produced entangled states for secure applications. Finally we discuss an experimental realization of a multiparty purification protocol in optical lattices which is issued to improve the fidelity of cluster states created in such systems.

**2.    Nonclassical-light generation in a photonic band-gap nonlinear planar waveguide**  
Jan Perina Jr., Concita Sibilia, Daniela Tricca, Mario Bertolotti  
Phys. Rev. A 70, 043816 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405051  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optical parametric process occurring in a photonic band-gap planar waveguide is studied from the point of view of nonclassical-light generation. Nonlinearly interacting optical fields are described by the generalized superposition of coherent signals and noise using the method of operator linear corrections to a classical strong solution. Scattered backward-propagating fields are taken into account. Squeezed light as well as light with sub-Poissonian statistics can be obtained in two-mode fields under the specified conditions.

**3.    High performance guided-wave asynchronous heralded single photon source**  
Olivier Alibart, Daniel Barry Ostrowsky, Pascal Baldi, Sébastien Tanzilli  
Optics Letters 30, 12 (2005) 1539  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405075  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a guided wave heralded photon source based on the creation of non-degenerate photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down conversion in a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate waveguide. Using the signal photon at 1310 nm as a trigger, a gated detection process permits announcing the arrival of single photons at 1550 nm at the output of a single mode optical fiber with a high probability of 0.38. At the same time the multi-photon emission probability is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to poissonian light sources. Relying on guided wave technologies such as integrated optics and fiber optics components, our source offers stability, compactness and efficiency and can serve as a paradigm for guided wave devices applied to quantum communication and computation using existing telecom networks.

**4.    Quantum Computing and Zeroes of Zeta Functions**  
Wim van Dam  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405081  
<blockquote>
<p>
A possible connection between quantum computing and Zeta functions of finite field equations is described. Inspired by the 'spectral approach' to the Riemann conjecture, the assumption is that the zeroes of such Zeta functions correspond to the eigenvalues of finite dimensional unitary operators of natural quantum mechanical systems. The notion of universal, efficient quantum computation is used to model the desired quantum systems. Using eigenvalue estimation, such quantum circuits would be able to approximately count the number of solutions of finite field equations with an accuracy that does not appear to be feasible with a classical computer. For certain equations (Fermat hypersurfaces) it is show that one can indeed model their Zeta functions with efficient quantum algorithms, which gives some evidence in favor of the proposal of this article.

**5.    Adiabatic Quantum Computation is Equivalent to Standard Quantum Computation**  
Dorit Aharonov, Wim van Dam, Julia Kempe, Zeph Landau, Seth Lloyd, Oded Regev  
SIAM Journal of Computing, Vol. 37, Issue 1, p. 166-194 (2007), conference version in Proc. 45th FOCS, p. 42-51 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405098  
<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic quantum computation has recently attracted attention in the physics and computer science communities, but its computational power was unknown. We describe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm, which implies that the adiabatic computation model and the conventional quantum computation model are polynomially equivalent. Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models provides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues in quantum computation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and constructing fault tolerant quantum computers. In particular, by translating the main open questions in the area of quantum algorithms to the language of spectral gaps of sparse matrices, the result makes these questions accessible to a wider scientific audience, acquainted with mathematical physics, expander theory and rapidly mixing Markov chains.

**6.    Spatial search and the Dirac equation**  
Andrew M. Childs, Jeffrey Goldstone  
Phys. Rev. A 70, 042312 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405120  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of searching a d-dimensional lattice of N sites for a single marked location. We present a Hamiltonian that solves this problem in time of order sqrt(N) for d>2 and of order sqrt(N) log(N) in the critical dimension d=2. This improves upon the performance of our previous quantum walk search algorithm (which has a critical dimension of d=4), and matches the performance of a corresponding discrete-time quantum walk algorithm. The improvement uses a lattice version of the Dirac Hamiltonian, and thus requires the introduction of spin (or coin) degrees of freedom.

**7.    Quantum Random Walks do not need a Coin Toss**  
Apoorva Patel, K.S. Raghunathan, Pranaw Rungta  
Phys. Rev. A71 (2005) 032347  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405128  
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical randomized algorithms use a coin toss instruction to explore different evolutionary branches of a problem. Quantum algorithms, on the other hand, can explore multiple evolutionary branches by mere superposition of states. Discrete quantum random walks, studied in the literature, have nonetheless used both superposition and a quantum coin toss instruction. This is not necessary, and a discrete quantum random walk without a quantum coin toss instruction is defined and analyzed here. Our construction eliminates quantum entanglement from the algorithm, and the results match those obtained with a quantum coin toss instruction.

**8.    Spatial weak-light solitons in an electro-magnetically induced nonlinear waveguide**  
Tao Hong  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405132  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a weak probe light beam can form spatial solitons in an electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium composed of four-level atoms and a coupling light field. We find that the coupling light beam can induce a highly controllable nonlinear waveguide and exert very strong effects on the dynamical behavior of the solitons. Hence, in the EIT medium, it is not only possible to produce spatial solitons at very low light intensities but also simultaneously control these solitons by using the coupling-light-induced nonlinear waveguide.

**9.    Qubit Decoherence and Non-Markovian Dynamics at Low Temperatures via an Effective Spin-Boson Model**  
K. Shiokawa, B. L. Hu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405147  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Brownian oscillator model (QBM), in the Fock-space representation, can be viewed as a multi-level spin-boson model. At sufficiently low temperature, the oscillator degrees of freedom are dynamically reduced to the lowest two levels and the system behaves effectively as a two-level (E2L) spin-boson model (SBM) in this limit. We discuss the physical mechanism of level reduction and analyze the behavior of E2L-SBM from the QBM solutions. The availability of close solutions for the QBM enables us to study the non-Markovian features of decoherence and leakage in a SBM in the non-perturbative regime (e.g. without invoking the Born approximation) in better details than before. Our result captures very well the characteristic non-Markovian short time low temperature behavior common in many models.

**10.    Resource-efficient linear optical quantum computation**  
Daniel E. Browne, Terry Rudolph  
Physical Review Letters 95, 010501 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a scheme for linear optics quantum computation, that makes no use of teleported gates, and requires stable interferometry over only the coherence length of the photons. We achieve a much greater degree of efficiency and a simpler implementation than previous proposals. We follow the "cluster state" measurement based quantum computational approach, and show how cluster states may be efficiently generated from pairs of maximally polarization entangled photons using linear optical elements. We demonstrate the universality and usefulness of generic parity measurements, as well as introducing the use of redundant encoding of qubits to enable utilization of destructive measurements - both features of use in a more general context.

**11.    Reversible quantum cellular automata**  
B. Schumacher, R.F. Werner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405174  
<blockquote>
<p>
We define quantum cellular automata as infinite quantum lattice systems with discrete time dynamics, such that the time step commutes with lattice translations and has strictly finite propagation speed. In contrast to earlier definitions this allows us to give an explicit characterization of all local rules generating such automata. The same local rules also generate the global time step for automata with periodic boundary conditions. Our main structure theorem asserts that any quantum cellular automaton is structurally reversible, i.e., that it can be obtained by applying two blockwise unitary operations in a generalized Margolus partitioning scheme. This implies that, in contrast to the classical case, the inverse of a nearest neighbor quantum cellular automaton is again a nearest neighbor automaton. We present several construction methods for quantum cellular automata, based on unitaries commuting with their translates, on the quantization of (arbitrary) reversible classical cellular automata, on quantum circuits, and on Clifford transformations with respect to a description of the single cells by finite Weyl systems. Moreover, we indicate how quantum random walks can be considered as special cases of cellular automata, namely by restricting a quantum lattice gas automaton with local particle number conservation to the single particle sector.

**12.    Classical versus quantum errors in quantum computation of dynamical systems**  
Davide Rossini, Giuliano Benenti, Giulio Casati  
Phys. Rev. E 70, 056216 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405189  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the stability of a quantum algorithm simulating the quantum dynamics of a system with different regimes, ranging from global chaos to integrability. We compare, in these different regimes, the behavior of the fidelity of quantum motion when the system's parameters are perturbed or when there are unitary errors in the quantum gates implementing the quantum algorithm. While the first kind of errors has a classical limit, the second one has no classical analogue. It is shown that, whereas in the first case (``classical errors'') the decay of fidelity is very sensitive to the dynamical regime, in the second case (``quantum errors'') it is almost independent of the dynamical behavior of the simulated system. Therefore, the rich variety of behaviors found in the study of the stability of quantum motion under ``classical'' perturbations has no correspondence in the fidelity of quantum computation under its natural perturbations. In particular, in this latter case it is not possible to recover the semiclassical regime in which the fidelity decays with a rate given by the classical Lyapunov exponent.

**13.    Error counting in a quantum error-correcting code and the ground-state energy of a spin glass**  
Hidetoshi Nishimori, Peter Sollich  
Journal of the Physical Society of Japan, 73:2701-2707, 2004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0405313  
<blockquote>
<p>
Upper and lower bounds are given for the number of equivalence classes of error patterns in the toric code for quantum memory. The results are used to derive a lower bound on the ground-state energy of the +/-J Ising spin glass model on the square lattice with symmetric and asymmetric bond distributions. This is a highly non-trivial example in which insights from quantum information lead directly to an explicit result on a physical quantity in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems.

**14.    Universal collective rotation channels and quantum error correction**  
Marius Junge, Peter T. Kim, David W. Kribs  
J. Math. Phys., 46 (2005), 022102.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0405032  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present and investigate a new class of quantum channels, what we call `universal collective rotation channels', that includes the well-known class of collective rotation channels as a special case. The fixed point set and noise commutant coincide for a channel in this class. Computing the precise structure of this C*-algebra is a core problem in a particular noiseless subsystem method of quantum error correction. We prove that there is an abundance of noiseless subsystems for every channel in this class and that Young tableaux combinatorics can be used to explicitly compute these subsystems.
