**1.    Decoherence can be useful in quantum walks**  
Viv Kendon, Ben Tregenna  
Pys. Rev. A 67 042315 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209005  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a study of the effects of decoherence in the operation of a discrete quantum walk on a line, cycle and hypercube. We find high sensitivity to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of decoherence is to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms. Specifically, we observe a highly uniform distribution on the line, a very fast mixing time on the cycle, and more reliable hitting times across the hypercube.

**2.    Oxide-Semiconductor Materials for Quantum Computation**  
Jeremy Levy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209008  
<blockquote>
<p>
Scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer architectures require quantum gates that operate within a small fraction of the qubit decoherence time and with high accuracy over a bandwidth set by the decoherence rate. Electron spin quantum bits in Si are promising because of long decoherence times (~0.5 ms), but electrical gating schemes still seem problematic. Oxide-semiconductor heterostructures have the potential for precise electrical control of gate operations in the semiconductor, using optical rectification in the ferroelectric oxide. Accurate (~80 dB), local (~10 nm), dynamic (>THz) and programmable optical control over electric polarization in the ferroelectric can be achieved using existing technology. Optical techniques may also be useful in rapid initialization of the quantum computer, and for providing a source of initialized qubits to use for quantum error correction. Advantages of optical methods will be discussed within a framework proposed for a quantum information processor using ferroelectrically coupled electron spins and Ge quantum dots in Si.

**3.    Effective Hamiltonians in quantum optics: a systematic approach**  
A.B. Klimov, L.L. Sanchez-Soto, A. Navarro, E.C. Yustas  
J. Mod. Opt 49, 2211-2226 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209013  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss a general and systematic method for obtaining effective Hamiltonians that describe different nonlinear optical processes. The method exploits the existence of a nonlinear deformation of the usual su(2) algebra that arises as the dynamical symmetry of the original model. When some physical parameter, dictated by the process under consideration, becomes small, we immediately get a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that correctly represents the dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We extend the technique to su(3) and su(N), finding the corresponding effective Hamiltonians when some resonance conditions are fulfilled.

**4.    Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulator: Experimental Application to Nonlinear Interferometers**  
D. Leibfried, B. DeMarco, V. Meyer, M. Rowe, A. Ben-Kish, J. Britton, W.M. Itano, B. Jelenkovi?, C. Langer, T. Rosenband, D.J. Wineland  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209028  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how an experimentally realized set of operations on a single trapped ion is sufficient to simulate a wide class of Hamiltonians of a spin-1/2 particle in an external potential. This system is also able to simulate other physical dynamics. As a demonstration, we simulate the action of an $n$-th order nonlinear optical beamsplitter. Two of these beamsplitters can be used to construct an interferometer sensitive to phase shifts in one of the interferometer beam paths. The sensitivity in determining these phase shifts increases linearly with $n$, and the simulation demonstrates that the use of nonlinear beamsplitters ($n$=2,3) enhances this sensitivity compared to the standard quantum limit imposed by a linear beamsplitter ($n$=1).

**5.    Diffusive-ballistic crossover in 1D quantum walks**  
Daniel K. Wojcik, J.R. Dorfman  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 (2003) 230602  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209036  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that particle transport in a uniform, quantum multi-baker map, is generically ballistic in the long time limit, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. Random matrix theory provides explicit analytical predictions for the mean square displacement of a particle in the system. These results exhibit a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time from diffusive to ballistic motion on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant. We can argue, that for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum multi-baker, a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Using an initial equilibrium density matrix, we find that diffusive behavior is recovered in the semi-classical limit for such systems, without further interactions with the environment.

**6.    Probabilistic quantum error correction**  
Jesse Fern, John Terilla  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209058  
<blockquote>
<p>
There are well known necessary and sufficient conditions for a quantum code to correct a set of errors. We study weaker conditions under which a quantum code may correct errors with probabilities that may be less than one. We work with stabilizer codes and as an application study how the nine qubit code, the seven qubit code, and the five qubit code perform when there are errors on more than one qubit. As a second application, we discuss the concept of syndrome quality and use it to suggest a way that quantum error correction can be practically improved.

**7.    Quantum Lower Bound for Recursive Fourier Sampling**  
Scott Aaronson  
Quantum Information and Computation 3(2):165-174, 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209060  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the earliest quantum algorithms was discovered by Bernstein and Vazirani, for a problem called Recursive Fourier Sampling. This paper shows that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is not far from optimal. The moral is that the need to "uncompute" garbage can impose a fundamental limit on efficient quantum computation. The proof introduces a new parameter of Boolean functions called the "nonparity coefficient," which might be of independent interest.

**8.    Frequency down conversion through Bose condensation of light**  
Patrick Navez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209077  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimental set up allowing to convert an input light of wavelengths about $1-2 \mu m$ into an output light of a lower frequency. The basic principle of operating relies on the nonlinear optical properties exhibited by a microcavity filled with glass. The light inside this material behaves like a 2D interacting Bose gas susceptible to thermalise and create a quasi-condensate. Extension of this setup to a photonic bandgap material (fiber grating) allows the light to behave like a 3D Bose gas leading, after thermalisation, to the formation of a Bose condensate. Theoretical estimations show that a conversion of $1 \mu m$ into $1.5 \mu m$ is achieved with an input pulse of about $1 ns$ with a peak power of $10^3 W$, using a fiber grating containing an integrated cavity of size about $500 \mu m \times 100 \mu m^2$.

**9.    Entanglement gauge and the non-Abelian geometric phase with two photonic qubits**  
Karl-Peter Marzlin, Stephen D. Bartlett, Barry C. Sanders  
Phys.Rev.A67:022316,2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209098  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the entanglement gauge describing the combined effects of local operations and nonlocal unitary transformations on bipartite quantum systems. The entanglement gauge exploits the invariance of nonlocal properties for bipartite systems under local (gauge) transformations. This new formalism yields observable effects arising from the gauge geometry of the bipartite system. In particular, we propose a non-Abelian gauge theory realized via two separated spatial modes of the quantized electromagnetic field manipulated by linear optics. In this linear optical realization, a bi-partite state of two separated spatial modes can acquire a non-Abelian geometric phase.

**10.    Coassociative grammar, periodic orbits and quantum random walk over Z**  
Leroux Philippe  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209100  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that the combinatorics generated by the quantum random walk on Z can be interpreted from the reading of periodic orbits of the classical chaotic map $x \mapsto 2x mod 1$.

**11.    Mixing in Continuous Quantum Walks on Graphs**  
Amir Ahmadi, Ryan Belk, Christino Tamon, Carolyn Wendler  
Quantum Information and Computation 3 (2003), 611-618.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209106  
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical random walks on well-behaved graphs are rapidly mixing towards the uniform distribution. Moore and Russell showed that a continuous quantum walk on the hypercube is instantaneously uniform mixing. We show that the continuous-time quantum walks on other well-behaved graphs do not exhibit this uniform mixing. We prove that the only graphs amongst balanced complete multipartite graphs that have the instantaneous uniform mixing property are the complete graphs on two, three and four vertices, and the cycle graph on four vertices. Our proof exploits the circulant structure of these graphs. Furthermore, we conjecture that most complete cycles and Cayley graphs lack this mixing property as well.

**12.    Exponential algorithmic speedup by quantum walk**  
Andrew M. Childs, Richard Cleve, Enrico Deotto, Edward Farhi, Sam Gutmann, Daniel A. Spielman  
Proc. 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2003), pp. 59-68  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209131  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct an oracular (i.e., black box) problem that can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. The quantum algorithm is based on a continuous time quantum walk, and thus employs a different technique from previous quantum algorithms based on quantum Fourier transforms. We show how to implement the quantum walk efficiently in our oracular setting. We then show how this quantum walk can be used to solve our problem by rapidly traversing a graph. Finally, we prove that no classical algorithm can solve this problem with high probability in subexponential time.

**13.    Shortening Grover's search algorithm for an expectation value quantum computer**  
David Collins  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209148  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum algorithms are conventionally formulated for implementation on a single system of qubits amenable to projective measurements. However, in expectation value quantum computation, such as nuclear magnetic resonance realizations, the computer consists of an ensemble of identical qubit-systems amenable only to expectation value measurements. The prevalent strategy in such expectation value implementations of quantum algorithms has been to retain the conventional formulation's unitary operations but modify its initialization and measurement steps appropriately. This naive approach is not optimal for Grover's algorithm and a shortened version for expectation value quantum computers is presented.

**14.    Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Lateral Casimir Force Between Corrugated Surfaces**  
F.Chen, U. Mohideen, G.L.Klimchitskaya, V.M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. A, vol.66, N3, p.032113-(1-11), 2002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209167  
<blockquote>
<p>
The lateral Casimir force acting between a sinusoidally corrugated gold plate and sphere was calculated and measured. The experimental setup was based on the atomic force microscope specially adapted for the measurement of the lateral Casimir force. The measured force oscillates sinusoidally as a function of the phase difference between the two corrugations. Both systematic and random errors are analysed and a lateral force amplitude of $3.2\times 10^{-13} $N was measured at a separation distance of 221 nm with a resulting relative error 24% at a 95% confidence probability. The dependence of the measured lateral force amplitude on separation was investigated and shown to be consistent with the inverse fourth power distance dependence. The complete theory of the lateral Casimir force is presented including finite conductivity and roughness corrections. The obtained theoretical dependence was analysed as a function of surface separation, corrugation amplitudes, phase difference, and plasma wavelength of a metal. The theory was compared with the experimental data and shown to be in good agreement. The constraints on hypothetical Yukawa-type interactions following from the measurements of the lateral Casimir force are calculated. The possible applications of the lateral vacuum forces to nanotechnology are discussed.

**15.    Comment on "Uncertainty in measurements of distance"**  
Y. Jack Ng, H. van Dam  
Class.Quant.Grav. 20 (2003) 393  
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0209021  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have argued that quantum mechanics and general relativity give a lower bound $\delta l \gtrsim l^{1/3} l_P^{2/3}$ on the measurement uncertainty of any distance $l$ much greater than the Planck length $l_P$. Recently Baez and Olson have claimed that one can go below this bound by attaching the measuring device to a massive elastic rod. Here we refute their claim. We also reiterate (and invite our critics to ponder on) the intimate relationship and consistency between black hole physics (including the holographic principle) and our bound on distance measurements.
