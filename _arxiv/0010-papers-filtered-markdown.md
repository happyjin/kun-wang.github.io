**1.    Environment-Induced Decoherence and the Transition From Quantum to Classical**  
Juan Pablo Paz, Wojciech Hubert Zurek  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010011  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study dynamics of quantum open systems, paying special attention to those aspects of their evolution which are relevant to the transition from quantum to classical. We begin with a discussion of the conditional dynamics of simple systems. The resulting models are straightforward but suffice to illustrate basic physical ideas behind quantum measurements and decoherence. To discuss decoherence and environment-induced superselection einselection in a more general setting, we sketch perturbative as well as exact derivations of several master equations valid for various systems. Using these equations we study einselection employing the general strategy of the predictability sieve. Assumptions that are usually made in the discussion of decoherence are critically reexamined along with the ``standard lore'' to which they lead. Restoration of quantum-classical correspondence in systems that are classically chaotic is discussed. The dynamical second law -it is shown- can be traced to the same phenomena that allow for the restoration of the correspondence principle in decohering chaotic systems (where it is otherwise lost on a very short time-scale). Quantum error correction is discussed as an example of an anti-decoherence strategy. Implications of decoherence and einselection for the interpretation of quantum theory are briefly pointed out.

**4.    Artificial Orbitals and a Solution to Grover's Problem**  
Michael Stay  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010065  
<blockquote>
<p>
By allowing measurements of observables other than the state of the qubits in a quantum computer, one can find eigenvectors very quickly. If a unitary operation U is implemented as a time-independent Hamiltonian, for instance, one can collapse the state of the computer to a nearby eigenvector of U with a measurement of the energy. We examine some recent proposals for quantum computation using time-independent Hamiltonians and show how to convert them into ``artificial orbitals'' whose energy eigenstates match those of U. This system can be used to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues with a single measurement. We apply this technique to Grover's algorithm and the continuous variant proposed by Farhi and Gutmann.

**5.    Computational leakage: Grover's algorithm with imperfections**  
Pil Hun Song, Ilki Kim  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010075  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effects of dissipation or leakage on the time evolution of Grover's algorithm for a quantum computer. We introduce an effective two-level model with dissipation and randomness (imperfections), which is based upon the idea that ideal Grover's algorithm operates in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space. The simulation results of this model and Grover's algorithm with imperfections are compared, and it is found that they are in good agreement for appropriately tuned parameters. It turns out that the main features of Grover's algorithm with imperfections can be understood in terms of two basic mechanisms, namely, a diffusion of probability density into the full Hilbert space and a stochastic rotation within the original 2-dimensional Hilbert space.

**6.    Analysis of Generalized Grover's Quantum Search Algorithms Using Recursion Equations**  
Eli Biham, Ofer Biham, David Biron, Markus Grassl, Daniel A. Lidar, Daniel Shapira  
Phys. Rev. A 63, 012310 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010077  
<blockquote>
<p>
The recursion equation analysis of Grover's quantum search algorithm presented by Biham et al. [PRA 60, 2742 (1999)] is generalized. It is applied to the large class of Grover's type algorithms in which the Hadamard transform is replaced by any other unitary transformation and the phase inversion is replaced by a rotation by an arbitrary angle. The time evolution of the amplitudes of the marked and unmarked states, for any initial complex amplitude distribution is expressed using first order linear difference equations. These equations are solved exactly. The solution provides the number of iterations T after which the probability of finding a marked state upon measurement is the highest, as well as the value of this probability, P_max. Both T and P_max are found to depend on the averages and variances of the initial amplitude distributions of the marked and unmarked states, but not on higher moments.

**7.    The Quantum-Classical Transition in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems**  
Salman Habib, Kurt Jacobs, Hideo Mabuchi, Robert Ryne, Kosuke Shizume, Bala Sundaram  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 040402 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010093  
<blockquote>
<p>
Viewed as approximations to quantum mechanics, classical evolutions can violate the positive-semidefiniteness of the density matrix. The nature of this violation suggests a classification of dynamical systems based on classical-quantum correspondence; we show that this can be used to identify when environmental interaction (decoherence) will be unsuccessful in inducing the quantum-classical transition. In particular, the late-time Wigner function can become positive without any corresponding approach to classical dynamics. In the light of these results, we emphasize key issues relevant for experiments studying the quantum-classical transition.

**8.    Quantum Walk on the Line**  
Ashwin Nayak, Ashvin Vishwanath  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010117  
<blockquote>
<p>
Motivated by the immense success of random walk and Markov chain methods in the design of classical algorithms, we consider_quantum_ walks on graphs. We analyse in detail the behaviour of unbiased quantum walk on the line, with the example of a typical walk, the ``Hadamard walk''. We show that after t time steps, the probability distribution on the line induced by the Hadamard walk is almost uniformly distributed over the interval [-t/sqrt(2),t/sqrt(2)]. This implies that the same walk defined on the circle mixes in_linear_ time. This is in direct contrast with the quadratic mixing time for the corresponding classical walk. We conclude by indicating how our techniques may be applied to more general graphs.
