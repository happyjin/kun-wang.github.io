**1.    Heisenberg versus standard scaling in quantum metrology with Markov generated states and monitored environment**  
Catalin Catana, Madalin Guta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0116  
<blockquote>
<p>
Finding optimal and noise robust probe states is a key problem in quantum metrology. In this paper we propose Markov dynamics as a possible mechanism for generating such states, and show how the Heisenberg scaling emerges for systems with multiple `dynamical phases' (stationary states), and noiseless channels. We model noisy channels by coupling the Markov output to `environment' ancillas, and consider the scenario where the environment is monitored to increase the quantum Fisher information of the output. In this setup we find that the survival of the Heisenberg limit depends on whether the environment receives `which phase' information about the memory system.

**2.    Quantum Random State Generation with Predefined Entanglement Constraint**  
Anmer Daskin, Ananth Grama, Sabre Kais  
International Journal of Quantum Information Vol. 12, No. 5 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0270  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement plays an important role in quantum communication, algorithms, and error correction. Schmidt coefficients are correlated to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix. These eigenvalues are used in Von Neumann entropy to quantify the amount of the bipartite entanglement. In this paper, we map the Schmidt basis and the associated coefficients to quantum circuits to generate random quantum states. We also show that it is possible to adjust the entanglement between subsystems by changing the quantum gates corresponding to the Schmidt coefficients. In this manner, random quantum states with predefined bipartite entanglement amounts can be generated using random Schmidt basis. This provides a technique for generating equivalent quantum states for given weighted graph states, which are very useful in the study of entanglement, quantum computing, and quantum error correction.

**3.    Quantum tunneling and evolution speed in an exactly solvable coupled double-well system**  
Hideo Hasegawa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0543  
<blockquote>
<p>
Exact analytical calculations of eigenvalues and eigenstates are presented for quantum coupled double-well (DW) systems with Razavy's hyperbolic potential. With the use of four kinds of initial wavepackets, we have calculated the tunneling period $T$ and the orthogonality time $\tau$ which signifies a time interval for an initial state to evolve to its orthogonal state. We discuss the coupling dependence of $T$ and $\tau$, and the relation between $\tau$ and the concurrence $C$ which is a typical measure of the entanglement in two qubits. Our calculations have shown that it is not clear whether the speed of quantum evolution may be measured by $T$ or $\tau$ and that the evolution speed measured by $\tau$ (or $T$) is not necessarily increased with increasing $C$. This is in contrast with the earlier study [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd and L. Maccone, Europhys. Lett. {\bf 62} (2003) 615] which pointed out that the evolution speed measured by $\tau$ is enhanced by the entanglement in the two-level model.

**4.    Quasithermodynamic Representation of the Pauli Markov equation and their possible applications**  
E. D. Vol  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1022  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that the extensive class of open Markov quantum systems describing by the Pauli master equation can be represented in so- called quasithermodynamic form .Such representation has certain advantages in many respects for example it allows one to specify precisely the parameter region in which the relaxation of the system in question to its stationary state occurs monotonically.With a view to illustrate possible applications of such representation we consider concrete Markov model that has in our opinion self-dependent interest namely the explanation of important and well established by numerous experiments the Yerkes-Dodson law in psychology

**5.    The Zeno limit in frequency estimation with non-Markovian environments**  
Katarzyna Macieszczak  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1333  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove the Zeno limit $N^{3/2}$ of the quantum Fisher information for frequency estimation with a general initial state of $N$ two-level atoms in the presence of local non-Markovian dephasing noise, which was demonstrated for a GHZ state by A. W. Chin, S. F. Huelga, M. B. Plenio (2012). For collective dephasing we prove that non-Markovian noise allows for better scaling for both correlated and uncorelated states. The quantum enhancement in precision is at least as good as in the local case.

**6.    Quantum mechanical analogy and supersymmetry of electromagnetic wave modes in planar waveguides**  
H. P. Laba, V. M. Tkachuk  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 033826 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1416  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study an analogue of the equations describing TE and TM modes in a planar waveguide with an arbitrary continuous dependence of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability on coordinates with the stationary Schr\"odinger equation. The effective potential energies involved in the Schr\"odinger equation for TE and TM modes are found. In general, the effective potential energies for TE and TM modes are different but in the limit of a weak dependence of the permittivity and permeability on coordinates they coincide. In the case when the product of a position-dependent permittivity and permeability is constant, it means that the refractive index is constant, we find that the TE and TM modes are described by the supersymmtric quantum mechanics.

**7.    Nonlinear interaction between two heralded single photons**  
T. Guerreiro, A. Martin, B. Sanguinetti, J. S. Pelc, C. Langrock, M. M. Fejer, N. Gisin, H. Zbinden, N. Sangouard, R. T. Thew  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 173601 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2084  
<blockquote>
<p>
Harnessing nonlinearities strong enough to allow two single photons to interact with one another is not only a fascinating challenge but is central to numerous advanced applications in quantum information science. Currently, all known approaches are extremely challenging although a few have led to experimental realisations with attenuated classical laser light. This has included cross-phase modulation with weak classical light in atomic ensembles and optical fibres, converting incident laser light into a non-classical stream of photon or Rydberg blockades as well as all-optical switches with attenuated classical light in various atomic systems. Here we report the observation of a nonlinear parametric interaction between two true single photons. Single photons are initially generated by heralding one photon from each of two independent spontaneous parametric downconversion sources. The two heralded single photons are subsequently combined in a nonlinear waveguide where they are converted into a single photon with a higher energy. Our approach highlights the potential for quantum nonlinear optics with integrated devices, and as the photons are at telecom wavelengths, it is well adapted to applications in quantum communication.

**8.    Mapping of Topological Quantum Circuits to Physical Hardware**  
Alexandru Paler, Simon J. Devitt, Kae Nemoto, Ilia Polian  
Sci. Rep. 4, 4657 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2139  
<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum computation is a promising technique to achieve large-scale, error-corrected computation. Quantum hardware is used to create a large, 3-dimensional lattice of entangled qubits while performing computation requires strategic measurement in accordance with a topological circuit specification. The specification is a geometric structure that defines encoded information and fault-tolerant operations. The compilation of a topological circuit is one important aspect of programming a quantum computer, another is the mapping of the topological circuit into the operations performed by the hardware. Each qubit has to be controlled, and measurement results are needed to propagate encoded quantum information from input to output. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for mapping an topological circuit to the operations needed by the physical hardware. We determine the control commands for each qubit in the computer and the relevant measurements that are needed to track information as it moves through the circuit.

**9.    Non-Markovian Quantum Probes**  
Pinja Haikka, Sabrina Maniscalco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2156  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review the most recent developments in the theory of open quantum systems focusing on situations in which the reservoir memory effects, due to long-lasting and non-negligible correlations between system and environment, play a crucial role. These systems are often referred to as non-Markovian systems. After a brief summary of different measures of non-Markovianity that have been introduced over the last few years we restrict our analysis to the investigation of information flow between system and environment. Within this framework we introduce an important application of non-Markovianity, namely its use as a quantum probe of complex quantum systems. To illustrate this point we consider quantum probes of ultracold gases, spin chains, and trapped ion crystals and show how properties of these systems can be extracted by means of non-Markovianity measures.

**10.    Global Symmetry is Unnecessary for Fast Quantum Search**  
Jonatan Janmark, David A. Meyer, Thomas G. Wong  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 210502 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2228  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover's quantum search algorithm can be formulated as a quantum particle randomly walking on the (highly symmetric) complete graph, with one vertex marked by a nonzero potential. From an initial equal superposition, the state evolves in a two-dimensional subspace. Strongly regular graphs have a local symmetry that ensures that the state evolves in a \emph{three}-dimensional subspace, but most have no \emph{global} symmetry. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that quantum random walk search on known families of strongly regular graphs nevertheless achieves the full quantum speedup of $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, disproving the intuition that fast quantum search requires global symmetry.

**11.    Wavepacket dynamics in a quantum double-well system with Razavy's potential coupled to a harmonic oscillator**  
Hideo Hasegawa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2368  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied wavepacket dynamics in the Razavy hyperbolic double-well (DW) potential which is coupled to a harmonic oscillator (HO) by linear and quadratic interactions. Taking into account the lowest two states of DW and $(N+1)$ states of HO ($N=1$ to 10), we evaluate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the composite system. An analytical calculation is made for $N=1$ and numerical calculations are performed for $1 < N \leq 10$. Quantum tunneling of wavepackets is realized between two bottoms of composite potential $U(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ denote coordinates in DW and HO potentials, respectively. It has been shown that with increasing $N$ and/or the coupling strength, the tunneling period is considerably increased. Phase space plots of $\langle x \rangle$ vs. $\langle p_x \rangle$ and $\langle y \rangle$ vs. $\langle p_y \rangle$ are elliptic, where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes an expectation value for the two-term wavepacket. This result is quite different from the relevant one previously obtained for the quartic DW potential with the use of the quantum phase space representation [Babyuk, arXiv:0208070]. Similarity and difference between results calculated for linear and quadratic couplings, and the uncertainty relation in the model are discussed.

**12.    Observable measure of quantum coherence in finite dimensional systems**  
Davide Girolami  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 170401 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2446  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum coherence is the key resource for quantum technology, with applications in quantum optics, information processing, metrology and cryptography. Yet, there is no universally efficient method for quantifying coherence either in theoretical or in experimental practice. I introduce a framework for measuring quantum coherence in finite dimensional systems. I define a theoretical measure which satisfies the reliability criteria established in the context of quantum resource theories. Then, I present an experimental scheme implementable with current technology which evaluates the quantum coherence of an unknown state of a d-dimensional system by performing two programmable measurements on an ancillary qubit, in place of the $O(d^2)$ direct measurements required by full state reconstruction. The result yields a benchmark for monitoring quantum effects in complex systems, e.g. certifying non-classicality in quantum communication and simulation protocols and probing the quantum behaviour of biological complexes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2635  
<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated quantum photonics is a promising approach for future practical and large-scale quantum information processing technologies, with the prospect of on-chip generation, manipulation and measurement of complex quantum states of light. The gallium arsenide (GaAs) material system is a promising technology platform, and has already successfully demonstrated key components including waveguide integrated single-photon sources and integrated single-photon detectors. However, quantum circuits capable of manipulating quantum states of light have so far not been investigated in this material system. Here, we report GaAs photonic circuits for the manipulation of single-photon and two-photon states. Two-photon quantum interference with a visibility of 94.9 +/- 1.3% was observed in GaAs directional couplers. Classical and quantum interference fringes with visibilities of 98.6 +/- 1.3% and 84.4 +/- 1.5% respectively were demonstrated in Mach-Zehnder interferometers exploiting the electro-optic Pockels effect. This work paves the way for a fully integrated quantum technology platform based on the GaAs material system.

**14.    Spatial search by continuous-time quantum walks on crystal lattices**  
Andrew M. Childs, Yimin Ge  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 052337 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2676  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of searching a general $d$-dimensional lattice of $N$ vertices for a single marked item using a continuous-time quantum walk. We demand locality, but allow the walk to vary periodically on a small scale. By constructing lattice Hamiltonians exhibiting Dirac points in their dispersion relations and exploiting the linear behaviour near a Dirac point, we develop algorithms that solve the problem in a time of $O(\sqrt N)$ for $d>2$ and $O(\sqrt N \log N)$ in $d=2$. In particular, we show that such algorithms exist even for hypercubic lattices in any dimension. Unlike previous continuous-time quantum walk algorithms on hypercubic lattices in low dimensions, our approach does not use external memory.

**15.    Measurement-based tailoring of Anderson localization of partially coherent light**  
Ji?í Svozilík, Jan Pe?ina Jr., Juan P. Torres  
Phys. Rev. A 89, 053808 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2999  
<blockquote>
<p>
We put forward an experimental configuration to observe transverse Anderson localization of partially coherent light beams with a tunable degree of first-order coherence. The scheme makes use of entangled photons propagating in disordered waveguide arrays, and is based on the unique relationship between the degree of entanglement of a pair of photons and the coherence properties of the individual photons constituting the pair. The scheme can be readily implemented with current waveguide-on-a-chip technology, and surprisingly, the tunability of the coherence properties of the individual photons is done at the measurement stage, without resorting changes of the light source itself.

Physical Review Letters 113, 013002, 2nd July 2014  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3485  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the first realisation of a solitonic atom interferometer. A Bose-Einstein condensate of $1\times10^4$ atoms of rubidium-85 is loaded into a horizontal optical waveguide. Through the use of a Feshbach resonance, the $s$-wave scattering length of the $^{85}$Rb atoms is tuned to a small negative value. This attractive atomic interaction then balances the inherent matter-wave dispersion, creating a bright solitonic matter wave. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is constructed by driving Bragg transitions with the use of an optical lattice co-linear with the waveguide. Matter wave propagation and interferometric fringe visibility are compared across a range of $s$-wave scattering values including repulsive, attractive and non-interacting values. The solitonic matter wave is found to significantly increase fringe visibility even compared with a non-interacting cloud.

Yogesh N. Joglekar, Derek D. Scott, Avadh Saxena  
Phys. Rev. A 90, 032108 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4204  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the parity- and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry breaking in lattice models in the presence of long-ranged, non-hermitian, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potentials that remain finite or become divergent in the continuum limit. By scaling analysis of the fragile $\mathcal{PT}$ threshold for an open finite lattice, we show that continuum loss-gain potentials $V_\alpha(x)\propto i |x|^\alpha \mathrm{sign}(x)$ have a positive $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking threshold for $\alpha>-2$, and a zero threshold for $\alpha\leq -2$. When $\alpha<0$ localized states with complex (conjugate) energies in the continuum energy-band occur at higher loss-gain strengths. We investigate the signatures of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in coupled waveguides, and show that the emergence of localized states dramatically shortens the relevant time-scale in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken region.

<blockquote>
<p>
Time-frequency Schmidt (TFS) modes of ultrafast quantum states are naturally compatible with high bit-rate integrated quantum communication networks. Thus they offer an attractive alternative for the realization of high dimensional quantum optics. Here, we present a quantum pulse gate based on dispersion-engineered ultrafast frequency conversion in a nonlinear optical waveguide, which is a key element for harnessing the potential of TFS modes. We experimentally retrieve the modal spectral-temporal structure of our device and demonstrate a single-mode operation fidelity of 80\%, which is limited by experimental shortcomings. In addition, we retrieve a conversion efficiency of 87.7\% with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 8.8 when operating the quantum pulse gate at the single-photon level.

Jason Doukas, Luke Westwood, Daniele Faccio, Andrea Di Falco, Ivette Fuentes  
Phys. Rev. D 90, 024022 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4855  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the intrinsic uncertainty in the accuracy to which a static spacetime can be measured from scattering experiments. In particular, we focus on the Schwarzschild black hole and a spatially kinked metric that has some mathematical resemblance to an expanding universe. Under selected conditions we find that the scattering problem can be framed in terms of a lossy bosonic channel, which allows us to identify shot-noise scaling as the ultimate scaling-limit to the estimation of the spacetimes. Fock state probes with particle counting measurements attain this ultimate scaling limit and the scaling constants for each spacetime are computed and compared to the practical strategies of coherent state probes with heterodyne and homodyne measurements. A promising avenue to analyze the quantum-limit of the analogue spacetimes in optical waveguides is suggested.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4857  
<blockquote>
<p>
Inspired by the classical phenomenon of random walk, the concept of quantum walk has emerged recently as a powerful platform for the dynamical simulation of complex quantum systems, entanglement production and universal quantum computation. Such a wide perspective motivates a renewing search for efficient, scalable and stable implementations of this quantum process. Photonic approaches have hitherto mainly focused on multi-path schemes, requiring interferometric stability and a number of optical elements that scales quadratically with the number of steps. Here we report the experimental realization of a quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous indistinguishable photons. The whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers, and requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for implementing quantum simulations, based on exploiting the transverse modes of a single light beam as quantum degrees of freedom.

Phys. Rev. A 89, 042304 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4863  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a systematic comparison of different methods of fidelity estimation of a linear optical quantum controlled-Z gate implemented by two-photon interference on a partially polarizing beam splitter. We have utilized a linear fidelity estimator based on the Monte Carlo sampling technique as well as a non-linear estimator based on maximum likelihood reconstruction of a full quantum process matrix. In addition, we have also evaluated lower bound on quantum gate fidelity determined by average quantum state fidelities for two mutually unbiased bases. In order to probe various regimes of operation of the gate we have introduced a tunable delay line between the two photons. This allowed us to move from high-fidelity operation to a regime where the photons become distinguishable and the success probability of the scheme significantly depends on input state. We discuss in detail possible systematic effects that could influence the gate fidelity estimation.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 260503 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4956  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the distribution of errors on a computationally useful entangled state generated via the repeated emission from an emitter undergoing strongly non-Markovian evolution. For emitter-environment coupling of pure-dephasing form, we show that the probability that a particular patten of errors occurs has a bound of Markovian form, and thus accuracy threshold theorems based on Markovian models should be just as effective. This is the case, for example, for a charged quantum dot emitter in a moderate to strong magnetic field. Beyond the pure-dephasing assumption, though complicated error structures can arise, they can still be qualitatively bounded by a Markovian error model.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose practical schemes for concentrating entanglement of a pair of unknown partially entangled Bell states and three-photon W states with cross-Kerr nonlinearity. In the schemes, utilizing local operations and classical communication, two separated parties can obtain one maximally entangled photon pair from two previously shared partially entangled photon pairs, and three separated parties can obtain one maximally entangled three-photon W state and a maximally entangled cluster state from two identical partially entangled three-photon W state with a certain success probability. Finally, we discuss the influences of sources of errors and decoherence on the schemes. The proposed setup is very simple, just employing some linear optical elements and cross-Kerr medium, which greatly simplifies the experimental realization of the schemes. The schemes are feasible within current experimental technology

We propose an implementation of a quantum walk on a circle on an optomechanical system by encoding the walker on the phase space of a radiation field and the coin on a two-level state of a mechanical resonator. The dynamics of the system is obtained by applying Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. We numerically show that the system displays a typical behavior of quantum walks, namely, the probability distribution evolves ballistically and the standard deviation of the phase distribution is linearly proportional to the number of steps. We also analyze the effects of decoherence by using the phase damping channel on the coin space, showing the possibility to implement the quantum walk with present day technology.

<p>
Trapped ions are pre-eminent candidates for building quantum information processors and quantum simulators. They have been used to demonstrate quantum gates and algorithms, quantum error correction, and basic quantum simulations. However, to realise the full potential of such systems and make scalable trapped-ion quantum computing a reality, there exist a number of practical problems which must be solved. These include tackling the observed high ion-heating rates and creating scalable trap structures which can be simply and reliably produced. Here, we report on cryogenically operated silicon ion traps which can be rapidly and easily fabricated using standard semiconductor technologies. Single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions have been trapped and used to characterize the trap operation. Long ion lifetimes were observed with the traps exhibiting heating rates as low as $\dot{\bar{n}}=$ 0.33 phonons/s at an ion-electrode distance of 230 $\mu$m. These results open many new avenues to arrays of micro-fabricated ion traps.

**26.    On The Power Of Coherently Controlled Quantum Adiabatic Evolutions**  
Maria Kieferova, Nathan Wiebe  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6545  
<blockquote>
<p>
A major challenge facing adiabatic quantum computing is that algorithm design and error correction can be difficult for adiabatic quantum computing. Recent work has considered addressing his challenge by using coherently controlled adiabatic evolutions in the place of classically controlled evolution. An important question remains: what is the relative power of controlled adiabatic evolution to traditional adiabatic evolutions? We address this by showing that coherent control and measurement provides a way to average different adiabatic evolutions in ways that cause their diabatic errors to cancel, allowing for adiabatic evolutions to combine the best characteristics of existing adiabatic optimizations strategies that are mutually exclusive in conventional adiabatic QIP. This result shows that coherent control and measurement can provide advantages for adiabatic state preparation. We also provide upper bounds on the complexity of simulating such evolutions on a circuit based quantum computer and provide sufficiency conditions for the equivalence of controlled adiabatic evolutions to adiabatic quantum computing.

<p>
Higher order nonclassical properties of fields propagating through a codirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler which is prepared by combining a linear wave guide and a nonlinear (quadratic) wave guide operated by second harmonic generation are studied. A completely quantum mechanical description is used here to describe the system. Closed form analytic solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for various modes are used to show the existence of higher order antibunching, higher order squeezing, higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement in the asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler. It is also shown that nonclassical properties of light can transfer from a nonlinear wave guide to a linear wave guide.

In this paper, we give a quantum circuit that calculates symmetrized functions. Our algorithm applies the original Grover's algorithm or a variant thereof such as AFGA (adaptive fixed point Grover's algorithm). Our algorithm uses AFGA in conjunction with two new techniques we call "targeting two hypotheses" and "blind targeting". Suppose AFGA drives the starting state $|s\rangle$ to the target state $|t\rangle$. When targeting two hypotheses, $|t\rangle$ is a superposition $a_0|0\rangle + a_1|1\rangle$ of two orthonormal states or hypotheses $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. When targeting blindly, the value of $\langle t| s\rangle$ is not known a priori.

The second is a marginal of a probability distribution $P(y^n)$, where $y^n\in Bool^n$. Known classical algorithms for calculating these Mobius-like transforms take ${\cal O}(2^n)$ steps. Our quantum algorithm is based on a Grover-like algorithm and it takes ${\cal O}(\sqrt{2^n})$ steps.

We show that when a bracket state is mixed at a beam splitter with a local oscillator, both the emerging beams exhibit a Fano factor larger than 1 and dependent on the relative phase between the input state and the local oscillator. We discuss the possibility to exploit this dependence to monitor the phase difference for the enhancement of the performances of a simple communication scheme based on direct detection. Our experimental setup involves linear optical elements and a pair of photon-number-resolving detectors operated in the mesoscopic photon-number domain.

**31.    Lecture Script: Introduction to Computational Quantum Mechanics**  
Roman Schmied  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7050  
<blockquote>
<p>
This document is the lecture script of a one-semester course taught at the University of Basel in the Fall semesters of 2012 and 2013. It is aimed at advanced students of physics who are familiar with the concepts and notations of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics lectures can often be separated into two classes. In the first class you get to know Schroedinger's equation and find the form and dynamics of simple physical systems (square well, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom); most calculations are analytic and inspired by calculations originally done in the 1920s and 1930s. In the second class you learn about large systems such as molecular structures, crystalline solids, or lattice models; these calculations are usually so complicated that it is difficult for the student to understand them in all detail. This lecture tries to bridge the gap between simple analytic calculations and complicated large-scale computations. We will revisit most of the problems encountered in introductory quantum mechanics, focusing on computer implementations for finding analytical as well as numerical solutions and their visualization. Most of these calculations are too complicated to be done by hand. Even relatively simple problems, such as two interacting particles in a one-dimensional trap, do not have analytic solutions and require the use of computers for their solution and visualization. More complex problems scale exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom, and make the use of large computer simulations unavoidable. The course is taught using the Mathematica programming language; however, the concepts presented are readily translated to any other programming language.

<p>
The implementation of a fully integrated Hadamard gate on one single chip is currently one of the major goals in the quantum computation and communication community. Prerequisites for such a chip are the integration of single-photon sources and detectors into waveguide structures such as photonic crystals or slab and ridge waveguide. Here, we present an implementation of a single-photon on-chip experiment based on a III-V semiconductor platform. Individual semiconductor quantum dots were used as pulsed single-photon sources integrated in ridge waveguides, and on-chip waveguide-beamsplitter operation is verified on the single-photon level by performing off-chip photon cross-correlation measurements between the two output ports of the beamsplitter. A careful characterization of the waveguide propagation losses (~ 0.0068 dB/um) documents the applicability of such GaAs-based waveguide structures in more complex photonic integrated circuits. The presented work marks an important step towards the realization of fully integrated photonic quantum circuits including on-demand single-photon sources.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study how the resilience of the surface code is affected by the coupling to a non-Markovian environment at zero temperature. The qubits in the surface code experience an effective dynamics due to the coupling to the environment that induces correlations among them. The range of the effective induced qubit-qubit interaction depends on parameters related to the environment and the duration of the quantum error correction cycle. We show numerically that different interaction ranges set different intrinsic bounds on the fidelity of the code. These bounds are unrelated to the error thresholds based on stochastic error models. We introduce a definition of stabilizers based on logical operators that allows us to efficiently implement a Metropolis algorithm to determine upper bounds to the fidelity error threshold.

<p>
In this paper we present a method to derive an exact master equation for a bosonic system coupled to a set of other bosonic systems, which plays the role of the reservoir, under the strong coupling regime, i.e., without resorting to either the rotating-wave or secular approximations. Working with phase-space distribution functions, we verify that the dynamics are separated in the evolution of its center, which follows classical mechanics, and its shape, which becomes distorted. This is the generalization of a result by Glauber, who stated that coherent states remain coherent under certain circumstances, specifically when the rotating-wave approximation and a zero-temperature reservoir are used. We show that the counter-rotating terms generate fluctuations that distort the vacuum state, much the same as thermal fluctuations.Finally, we discuss conditions for non-Markovian dynamics.

<p>
The linear driving for a single-mode optical field in a cavity can result from the external driving of classical field even when the coupling between the classical field and the cavity is weak. We revisit this well known effect with a microscopic model where a classical field is applied to a wall of the cavity to excite the atoms in the wall, and re-combination of the low excitations of the wall mediates a linear driving for the single-mode field inside the cavity. With such modeling about the indirect driving through the quantum excitations of the wall, we theoretically predict several non-linear optical effects for the strong coupling cases, such as photon anti-bunching and photon squeezing. In the sense, we propose the most simplified non-linear quantum photonics model.

We present a versatile, high-brightness, guided-wave source of polarization entangled photons, emitted at a telecom wavelength. Photon-pairs are generated using an integrated type-0 nonlinear waveguide, and subsequently prepared in a polarization entangled state via a stabilized fiber interferometer. We show that the single photon emission wavelength can be tuned over more than 50 nm, whereas the single photon spectral bandwidth can be chosen at will over more than five orders of magnitude (from 25 MHz to 4 THz). Moreover, by performing entanglement analysis, we demonstrate a high degree of control of the quantum state via the violation of the Bell inequalities by more than 40 standard deviations. This makes this scheme suitable for a wide range of quantum optics experiments, ranging from fundamental research to quantum information applications. We report on details of the setup, as well as on the characterization of all included components, previously outlined in F. Kaiser et al. (2013 Laser Phys. Lett. 10, 045202).

<blockquote>
<p>
The addressing of a particular qubit within a quantum register is a key prerequisite for scalable quantum computing. In general, executing a quantum gate with a single qubit, or a subset of qubits, affects the quantum states of all other qubits. This reduced fidelity of the whole quantum register could prevent the application of quantum error correction protocols and thus preclude scalability. We demonstrate addressing of individual qubits within a quantum byte (eight qubits) and measure the error induced in all non-addressed qubits (cross-talk) associated with the application of single-qubit gates. The quantum byte is implemented using microwave-driven hyperfine qubits of $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions confined in a Paul trap augmented with a magnetic gradient field. The measured cross-talk is on the order of $10^{-5}$ and therefore below the threshold commonly agreed sufficient to efficiently realize fault-tolerant quantum computing. Hence, our results demonstrate how this threshold can be overcome with respect to cross-talk.

We demonstrate the use of high-Q superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) microresonators to perform rapid manipulations on a randomly distributed spin ensemble using very low microwave power (400 nW). This power is compatible with dilution refrigerators, making microwave manipulation of spin ensembles feasible for quantum computing applications. We also describe the use of adiabatic microwave pulses to overcome microwave magnetic field ($B_{1}$) inhomogeneities inherent to CPW resonators. This allows for uniform control over a randomly distributed spin ensemble. Sensitivity data are reported showing a single shot (no signal averaging) sensitivity to $10^{7}$ spins or $3 \times 10^{4}$ spins/$\sqrt{Hz}$ with averaging.

The quantum model conserves the Ermakov-Lewis invariant, thus the photonic crystal also posses this symmetry.

<p>
We propose a theory of the thermal Casimir interaction for multilayered test bodies coated with a graphene sheet. The reflection coefficients on such structures are expressed in terms of the components of the polarization tensor and the dielectric permittivities of material layers. The developed theory is applied to calculate the gradient of the Casimir force between an Au-coated sphere and a graphene sheet deposited on a SiO${}_2$ film covering a Si plate, which is the configuration of a recent experiment performed by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope. The theoretical results are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data. We thus confirm that graphene influences the Casimir interaction and can be used for tailoring the force magnitude in nanostructures.

<p>
Cavity-free efficient coupling between emitters and guided modes is of great current interest for nonlinear quantum optics as well as efficient and scalable quantum information processing. In this work, we extend these activities to the coupling of organic dye molecules to a highly confined mode of a nanofiber, allowing mirrorless and low-threshold laser action in an effective mode volume of less than 100 femtoliters. We model this laser system based on semi-classical rate equations and present an analytic compact form of the laser output intensity. Despite the lack of a cavity structure, we achieve a coupling efficiency of the spontaneous emission to the waveguide mode of 0.07(0.01), in agreement with our calculations. In a further experiment, we also demonstrate the use of a plasmonic nanoparticle as a dispersive output coupler. Our laser architecture is promising for a number of applications in optofluidics and provides a fundamental model system for studying nonresonant feedback stimulated emission.

<blockquote>
<p>
A transparent material exhibits ultra-fast optical nonlinearity and is subject to optical pressure if irradiated by a laser beam. However, the effect of nonlinearity on optical pressure is often overlooked, even if a nonlinear optical pressure may be potentially employed in many applications, as optical manipulation, biophysics, cavity optomechanics, quantum optics, optical tractors, and is relevant in fundamental problems as the Abraham-Minkoswky dilemma, or the Casimir effect. Here we show that an ultra-fast nonlinear polarization gives indeed a contribution to the optical pressure that also is negative in certain spectral ranges; the theoretical analysis is confirmed by first-principles simulations. An order of magnitude estimate shows that the effect can be observable by measuring the deflection of a membrane made by graphene.

<p>
We describe high-fidelity entangling gates between singlet-triplet qubits (STQs) which are coupled via one quantum state (QS). The QS can be provided by a quantum dot itself or by another confined system. The orbital energies of the QS are tunable using an electric gate close to the QS, which changes the interactions between the STQs independent of their single-qubit parameters. Short gating sequences exist for the controlled NOT (CNOT) operations. We show that realistic quantum dot setups permit excellent entangling operations with gate infidelities below $10^{-3}$, which is lower than the quantum error correction threshold of the surface code. We consider limitations from fabrication errors, hyperfine interactions, spin-orbit interactions, and charge noise in GaAs and Si heterostructures.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate equilibrium and non-equilibrium charge-transfer processes by performing high-resolution transport spectroscopy. Using electrostatically defined quantum dots for energy-selective emission and detection, we achieved unprecedented spectral resolution and a high degree of tunability of relevant experimental parameters. Most importantly, we observe that the spectral width of elastically transferred electrons can be substantially smaller than the linewidth of a thermally broadened Coulomb peak. This finding indicates that the charge-transfer process is fast compared to the electron--phonon interaction time. By drawing an analogy to double quantum dots, we argue that the spectral width of the elastic resonance is determined by the lifetime broadening $h\it{\Gamma}$ of the emitter and detector states. Good agreement with the model is found also in an experiment in which the charge transfer is in the regime $h\it{\Gamma}\gg k_{\rm{B}}T$. By performing spectroscopy below the Fermi energy, we furthermore observe elastic and inelastic transfer of holes.

<p>
Subwavelength semiconductor nanowires have recently attracted interest for photonic applications because they possess various unique optical properties and offer great potential for miniaturizing devices. However, realizing tight light confinement or efficient coupling with photonic circuits is not straightforward and remains a challenge. Here we show that a high Q nanocavity can be created by placing a single III/V semiconductor nanowire with a diameter of under 100 nm in a grooved waveguide in a Si photonic crystal, by means of nanoprobe manipulation. We observe very fast spontaneous emission (91 ps) from nanowires accelerated by the strong Purcell enhancement in nanocavities, which proves that very strong light confinement can be achieved. Furthermore, this system enables us to move the nanocavity anywhere along the waveguide. This configuration provides a significant degree of flexibility in integrated photonics and permits the addition and displacement of various functionalities of III/V nanocavity devices in Si photonic circuits.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider sound wave propagation in a range-periodic acoustic waveguide in the deep ocean. It is demonstrated that vertical oscillations of a sound-speed perturbation, induced by ocean internal waves, influence near-axial rays in a resonant way, producing ray chaos and forming a wide chaotic sea in the underlying phase space. We study interplay between chaotic ray dynamics and wave motion with signal frequencies of 50-100 Hz. The Floquet modes of the waveguide are calculated and visualized by means of the Husimi plots. Despite of irregular phase space distribution of periodic orbits, the Husimi plots display the presence of ordered peaks within the chaotic sea. These peaks, not being supported by certain periodic orbits, draw the specific "chainlike" pattern, reminiscent of KAM resonance. The link between the peaks and KAM resonance is confirmed by ray calculations with lower amplitude of the sound-speed perturbation, when the periodic orbits are well-ordered. We associate occurrence of the peaks with the recovery of ordered periodic orbits, corresponding to KAM resonance, due to suppressing of wavefield sensitivity to small-scale features of the sound-speed profile.

The fractional quantized Hall state (FQHS) at the filling factor {\nu} = 5/2 is of special interest due to its possible application for quantum computing. Here we report on the optimization of growth parameters that allowed us to produce two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with a 5/2 gap energy up to 135 mK. We concentrated on optimizing the MBE growth to provide high 5/2 gap energies in "as-grown" samples, without the need to enhance the 2DEGs properties by illumination or gating techniques. Our findings allow us to analyse the impact of doping in narrow quantum wells with respect to conventional DX-doping in AlxGa1-xAs. The impact of the setback distance between doping layer and 2DEG was investigated as well. Additionally, we found a considerable increase in gap energy by reducing the amount of background impurities. To this end growth techniques like temperature reductions for substrate and effusion cells and the reduction of the Al mole fraction in the 2DEG region were applied.

<p>
Quasiperiodic lattices have recently been shown to be a non-trivial topological phase of matter. Charge pumping -- one of the hallmarks of topological states of matter -- was recently realized for photons in a one-dimensional (1D) off-diagonal Harper model implemented in a photonic waveguide array. The topologically nontrivial 1D Fibonacci quasicrystal (QC) is expected to facilitate a similar phenomenon, but its discrete nature and lack of pumping parameter hinder the experimental study of such topological effects. In this work we overcome these obstacles by utilizing a family of topologically equivalent QCs which ranges from the Fibonacci QC to the Harper model. Implemented in photonic waveguide arrays, we observe the topological properties of this family, and perform a topological pumping of photons across a Fibonacci QC.

<p>
The dynamics of quantum phase transitions poses one of the most challenging problems in modern many-body physics. Here, we study a prototypical example in a clean and well-controlled ultracold atom setup by observing the emergence of coherence when crossing the Mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition. In the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, we find perfect agreement between experimental observations and numerical simulations for the resulting coherence length. We thereby perform a largely certified analogue quantum simulation of this strongly correlated system reaching beyond the regime of free quasiparticles. Experimentally, we additionally explore the emergence of coherence in higher dimensions where no classical simulations are available, as well as for negative temperatures. For intermediate quench velocities, we observe a power-law behaviour of the coherence length, reminiscent of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. However, we find exponents that strongly depend on the final interaction strength and thus lie outside the scope of this mechanism.

We observe two consecutive heteronuclear Efimov resonances in an ultracold Li-Cs mixture by measuring three-body loss coefficients as a function of magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance. The first resonance is detected at a scattering length of $a_-^{(1)}=-320(10)~a_0$ corresponding to $\sim 7 $ ($\sim 3$) times the Li-Cs (Cs-Cs) van der Waals range. The second resonance appears at $5.8(1.0) a_-^{(1)}$ close to the unitarity-limited regime at the sample temperature of 450 nK. Indication of a third resonance is found in the atom loss spectra. The scaling of the resonance positions is close to the universal scaling value of 4.9 predicted for zero temperature. Deviations from universality might be caused by finite-range and temperature effects, as well as magnetic field dependent Cs-Cs interactions.
