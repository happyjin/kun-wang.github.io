**1.    Fault Testing for Reversible Circuits**  
Ketan N. Patel, John P. Hayes, Igor L. Markov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404003  
<blockquote>
<p>
Applications of reversible circuits can be found in the fields of low-power computation, cryptography, communications, digital signal processing, and the emerging field of quantum computation. Furthermore, prototype circuits for low-power applications are already being fabricated in CMOS. Regardless of the eventual technology adopted, testing is sure to be an important component in any robust implementation. We consider the test set generation problem. Reversibility affects the testing problem in fundamental ways, making it significantly simpler than for the irreversible case. For example, we show that any test set that detects all single stuck-at faults in a reversible circuit also detects all multiple stuck-at faults. We present efficient test set constructions for the standard stuck-at fault model as well as the usually intractable cell-fault model. We also give a practical test set generation algorithm, based on an integer linear programming formulation, that yields test sets approximately half the size of those produced by conventional ATPG.

**2.    Complementarity and quantum walks**  
Viv Kendon, Barry C. Sanders  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 022307 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404043  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that quantum walks interpolate between a coherent `wave walk' and a random walk depending on how strongly the walker's coin state is measured; i.e., the quantum walk exhibits the quintessentially quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested as a trade-off between knowledge of which path the walker takes vs the sharpness of the interference pattern. A physical implementation of a quantum walk (the quantum quincunx) should thus have an identifiable walker and the capacity to demonstrate the interpolation between wave walk and random walk depending on the strength of measurement.

**3.    A quantum Fourier transform algorithm**  
Chris Lomont  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404060  
<blockquote>
<p>
Algorithms to compute the quantum Fourier transform over a cyclic group are fundamental to many quantum algorithms. This paper describes such an algorithm and gives a proof of its correctness, tightening some claimed performance bounds given earlier. Exact bounds are given for the number of qubits needed to achieve a desired tolerance, allowing simulation of the algorithm.

**4.    On the Complexity of Quantum Languages**  
Elham Kashefi, Carolina Moura Alves  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404062  
<blockquote>
<p>
The standard inputs given to a quantum machine are classical binary strings. In this view, any quantum complexity class is a collection of subsets of $\{0,1\}^{*}$. However, a quantum machine can also accept quantum states as its input. T. Yamakami has introduced a general framework for quantum operators and inputs \cite{Yam02}. In this paper we present several quantum languages within this model and by generalizing the complexity classes QMA and QCMA we analyze the complexity of the introduced languages. We also discuss how to derive a classical language from a given quantum language and as a result we introduce new QCMA and QMA languages.

**5.    Small Pseudo-Random Families of Matrices: Derandomizing Approximate Quantum Encryption**  
Andris Ambainis, Adam Smith  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404075  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum encryption scheme (also called private quantum channel, or state randomization protocol) is a one-time pad for quantum messages. If two parties share a classical random string, one of them can transmit a quantum state to the other so that an eavesdropper gets little or no information about the state being transmitted. Perfect encryption schemes leak no information at all about the message. Approximate encryption schemes leak a non-zero (though small) amount of information but require a shorter shared random key. Approximate schemes with short keys have been shown to have a number of applications in quantum cryptography and information theory. This paper provides the first deterministic, polynomial-time constructions of quantum approximate encryption schemes with short keys. Previous constructions (quant-ph/0307104) are probabilistic--that is, they show that if the operators used for encryption are chosen at random, then with high probability the resulting protocol will be a secure encryption scheme. Moreover, the resulting protocol descriptions are exponentially long. Our protocols use keys of the same length as (or better length than) the probabilistic constructions; to encrypt $n$ qubits approximately, one needs $n+o(n)$ bits of shared key. An additional contribution of this paper is a connection between classical combinatorial derandomization and constructions of pseudo-random matrix families in a continuous space.

**6.    Completely Positive Post-Markovian Master Equation via a Measurement Approach**  
Alireza Shabani, Daniel A. Lidar  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101(R) (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404077  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new post-Markovian quantum master equation is derived, that includes bath memory effects via a phenomenologically introduced memory kernel k(t). The derivation uses as a formal tool a probabilistic single-shot bath-measurement process performed during the coupled system-bath evolution. The resulting analytically solvable master equation interpolates between the exact Nakajima-Zwanzig equation and the Markovian Lindblad equation. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete positivity in terms of properties of k(t) is presented, in addition to a prescription for the experimental determination of k(t). The formalism is illustrated with examples.

**7.    Classical simulation of Quantum Entanglement using Optical Transverse Modes in Multimode Waveguides**  
Jian Fu, Zhijian Si, Shaofang Tang, Jian Deng  
Phy Rev A 70, 042313 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404095  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss mode-entangled states based on the optical transverse modes of the optical field propagating in multi-mode waveguides, which are classical analogs of the quantum entangled states. The analogs are discussed in detail, including the violation of the Bell inequality and the correlation properties of optical pulses' group delays. The research on these analogs may be important, for it not only provides useful insights into fundamental features of quantum entanglement, but also yields new insights into quantum computation and quantum communication.

**8.    Experimental demonstration of a non-destructive controlled-NOT quantum gate for two independent photon-qubits**  
Zhi Zhao, An-Ning Zhang, Yu-Ao Chen, Han Zhang, Jiangfeng Du, Tao Yang, Jian-Wei Pan  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 030501 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404129  
<blockquote>
<p>
Universal logic gates for two quantum bits (qubits) form an essential ingredient of quantum information processing. However, the photons, one of the best candidates for qubits, suffer from the lack of strong nonlinear coupling required for quantum logic operations. Here we show how this drawback can be overcome by reporting a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a non-destructive controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for two independent photons using only linear optical elements in conjunction with single-photon sources and conditional dynamics. Moreover, we have exploited the CNOT gate to discriminate all the four Bell-states in a teleportation experiment.

**9.    Unified derivations of measurement-based schemes for quantum computation**  
Andrew M. Childs, Debbie W. Leung, Michael A. Nielsen  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 032318 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404132  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present unified, systematic derivations of schemes in the two known measurement-based models of quantum computation. The first model (introduced by Raussendorf and Briegel [Phys. Rev. Lett., 86, 5188 (2001)]) uses a fixed entangled state, adaptive measurements on single qubits, and feedforward of the measurement results. The second model (proposed by Nielsen [Phys. Lett. A, 308, 96 (2003)] and further simplified by Leung [Int. J. Quant. Inf., 2, 33 (2004)]) uses adaptive two-qubit measurements that can be applied to arbitrary pairs of qubits, and feedforward of the measurement results. The underlying principle of our derivations is a variant of teleportation introduced by Zhou, Leung, and Chuang [Phys. Rev. A, 62, 052316 (2000)]. Our derivations unify these two measurement-based models of quantum computation and provide significantly simpler schemes.

**10.    Optimal state encoding for quantum walks and quantum communication over spin systems**  
Henry L. Haselgrove  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 062326 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404152  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent work has shown that a simple chain of interacting spins can be used as a medium for high-fidelity quantum communication. We describe a scheme for quantum communication using a spin system that conserves z-spin, but otherwise is arbitrary. The sender and receiver are assumed to directly control several spins each, with the sender encoding the message state onto the larger state-space of her control spins. We show how to find the encoding that maximises the fidelity of communication, using a simple method based on the singular-value decomposition. Also, we show that this solution can be used to increase communication fidelity in a rather different circumstance: where no encoding of initial states is used, but where the sender and receiver control exactly two spins each and vary the interactions on those spins over time. The methods presented are computationally efficient, and numerical examples are given for systems having up to 300 spins.

**11.    Generalized Measurement and Conclusive Teleportation with Nonmaximal Entanglement**  
Hyunjae Kim, Yong Wook Cheong, Hai-Woong Lee  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404172  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present linear optical schemes to perform generalized measurements for conclusive teleportation when the sender and the receiver share nonmaximal entanglement resulting from amplitude errors during propagation or generation. Three different cases are considered for which the states to be teleported are unknown superpositions of (a) single-photon and vacuum states, (b) vertically-polarized and horizontally-polarized photon states, and (c) two coherent states of opposite phases. The generalized measurement scheme for each case is analyzed, which indicates that the success probability is much more resistant to amplitude errors for case (c) than for case (a) or (b).

**12.    Near-Complete Teleportation of a Superposed Coherent State**  
Yong Wook Cheong, Hyunjae Kim, Hai-Woong Lee  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404173  
<blockquote>
<p>
The four Bell-type entangled coherent states, |\alpha>|-\alpha> \pm |-\alpha> |\alpha> and |\alpha>|\alpha> \pm |-\alpha> |-\alpha>, can be discriminated with a high probability using only linear optical means, as long as |\alpha| is not too small. Based on this observation, we propose a simple scheme to almost completely teleport a superposed coherent state. The nonunitary transformation, that is required to complete the teleportation, can be achieved by embedding the receiver's field state in a larger Hilbert space consisting of the field and a single atom and performing a unitary transformation on this Hilbert space.

**13.    A quantum computing primer for operator theorists**  
David W. Kribs  
Lin. Alg. Appl., 400 (2005), 147-167.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404553  
<blockquote>
<p>
This is an exposition of some of the aspects of quantum computation and quantum information that have connections with operator theory. After a brief introduction, we discuss quantum algorithms. We outline basic properties of quantum channels, or equivalently, completely positive trace preserving maps. The main theorems for quantum error detection and correction are presented and we conclude with a description of a particular passive method of quantum error correction.
