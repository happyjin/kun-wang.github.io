K.-M.C. Fu, C. Santori, P.E. Barclay, I. Aharonovich, S. Prawer, N. Meyer, A. M. Holm, R.G. Beausoleil  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0328  
<blockquote>
<p>
The optical coupling of guided modes in a GaP waveguide to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is demonstrated. The electric field penetration into diamond and the loss of the guided mode are measured. The results indicate that the GaP-diamond system could be useful for realizing coupled microcavity-NV devices for quantum information processing in diamond.

**2.    Quantum error correction on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces**  
Cédric Bény, Achim Kempf, David W. Kribs  
J. Math. Phys. 50, 062108 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0421  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a generalization of quantum error correction to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The generalization yields new classes of quantum error correcting codes that have no finite-dimensional counterparts. The error correction theory we develop begins with a shift of focus from states to algebras of observables. Standard subspace codes and subsystem codes are seen as the special case of algebras of observables given by finite-dimensional von Neumann factors of type I. Our generalization allows for the correction of codes characterized by any von Neumann algebra and we give examples, in particular, of codes defined by infinite-dimensional algebras.

**3.    Quantum Speed-up for Approximating Partition Functions**  
Pawel Wocjan, Chen-Fu Chiang, Anura Abeyesinghe, Daniel Nagaj  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 022340 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0596  
<blockquote>
<p>
We achieve a quantum speed-up of fully polynomial randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS) for estimating partition functions that combine simulated annealing with the Monte-Carlo Markov Chain method and use non-adaptive cooling schedules. The improvement in time complexity is twofold: a quadratic reduction with respect to the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chains and a quadratic reduction with respect to the parameter characterizing the desired accuracy of the estimate output by the FPRAS. Both reductions are intimately related and cannot be achieved separately. First, we use Grover's fixed point search, quantum walks and phase estimation to efficiently prepare approximate coherent encodings of stationary distributions of the Markov chains. The speed-up we obtain in this way is due to the quadratic relation between the spectral and phase gaps of classical and quantum walks. Second, we generalize the method of quantum counting, showing how to estimate expected values of quantum observables. Using this method instead of classical sampling, we obtain the speed-up with respect to accuracy.

**4.    Relation between quantum dwell times and flux-flux correlations**  
J. Munoz, D. Seidel, J. G. Muga  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0789  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the connection between the dwell time of a quantum particle in a region of space and flux-flux correlations at the boundaries. It is shown that the first and second moments of a flux-flux correlation function which generalizes a previous proposal by Pollak and Miller [E. Pollak and W. H. Miller, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 53}, 115 (1984)], agree with the corresponding moments of the dwell-time distribution, whereas the third and higher moments do not. We also discuss operational approaches and approximations to measure the flux-flux correlation function and thus the second moment of the dwell time, which is shown to be characteristically quantum, and larger than the corresponding classical moment even for freely moving particles.

<blockquote>
<p>
The time reversal of a completely-positive, nonequilibrium discrete-time quantum Markov evolution is derived via a suitable adjointness relation. Space-time harmonic processes are introduced for the forward and reverse-time transition mechanisms, and their role for relative entropy dynamics is discussed.

**6.    Non-Markovian Effects on the Geometric Phase**  
X. L. Huang, X. X. Yi  
EPL 82 50001 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1071  
<blockquote>
<p>
The geometric phases of a two-level atom interacting with non-Markovian environments are calculated and the non-Markovian effects on the geometric phases are discussed in this paper. Three kinds of methods that describe the non-Markovian process, projection superoperator technique, memory kernel master equation and post-Markovian master equation, are used in the discussions. The results show that when the dissipation rate is large, the non-Markovian effects change the geometric phase more strikingly than the small one.

**7.    Continuous-variable quantum information processing with squeezed states of light**  
Hidehiro Yonezawa, Akira Furusawa  
Optics and Spectroscopy 108, 288-296 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1092  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate experiments of continuous-variable quantum information processing based on the teleportation scheme. Quantum teleportation, which is realized by a two-mode squeezed vacuum state and measurement-and-feedforward, is considered as an elementary quantum circuit as well as quantum communication. By modifying ancilla states or measurement-and-feedforwards, we can realize various quantum circuits which suffice for universal quantum computation. In order to realize the teleportation-based computation we improve the level of squeezing, and fidelity of teleportation. With a high-fidelity teleporter we demonstrate some advanced teleportation experiments, i.e., teleportation of a squeezed state and sequential teleportation of a coherent state. Moreover, as an example of the teleportation-based computation, we build a QND interaction gate which is a continuous-variable analog of a CNOT gate. A QND interaction gate is constructed only with ancillary squeezed vacuum states and measurement-and-feedforwards. We also create continuous-variable four mode cluster type entanglement for further application, namely, one-way quantum computation.

**8.    Entanglement oscillation and survival induced by non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of entangled squeezed-state**  
Jun-Hong An, Ye Yeo, Wei-Min Zhang, C. H. Oh  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42 (2009) 015302.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1309  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the exact decoherence dynamics of the entangled squeezed state of two single-mode optical fields interacting with two independent and uncorrelated environments. We analyze in detail the non-Markovian effects on the entanglement evolution of the initially entangled squeezed state for different environmental correlation time scales. We find that the environments have dual actions on the system: backaction and dissipation. In mparticular, when the environmental correlation time scale is comparable to the time scale for significant change in the system, the backaction would counteract the dissipative effect. Interestingly, this results in the survival of some residual entanglement in the final steady state.

**9.    Solid State Implementation of Quantum Random Walks on General Graphs**  
K Manouchehri, J.B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1795  
<blockquote>
<p>
Advances in recent years have made it possible to explore quantum dots as a viable technology for scalable quantum information processing. Charge qubits for example can be realized in the lowest bound states of coupled quantum dots and the precision control of the confinement potential allows for the realization of a full set of universal qubit gates, including arbitrary single-qubit rotations and two-qubit C-NOT gates. In this work we describe a novel scheme for implementing quantum random walks on arbitrarily complex graphs by extending these elementary operations to the control of a two-dimensional quantum dot grid. As single-qubit rotations constitute the essential building blocks of our implementation scheme, we also present numerical simulations of one such mechanism by directly solving the corresponding time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

**10.    Quantum simulations based on measurements and feedback control**  
K. G. H. Vollbrecht, J. I. Cirac  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1844  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for performing quantum simulations with atoms in cavities based on a photon detection feedback loop that requires only linear optical elements. Atoms can be stored individually without the need of directly interacting with one another. The scheme is able to simulate any time evolution that can be written as a sum of two-qubit Hamiltonians, .e.g., any next neighbor interaction on a lattice. It can also be made robust against photon losses.

**11.    Quantum Kolmogorov Complexity and Quantum Key Distribution**  
Takayuki Miyadera, Hideki Imai  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 012324 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2460  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol in the light of quantum algorithmic information. While Shannon's information theory needs a probability to define a notion of information, algorithmic information theory does not need it and can assign a notion of information to an individual object. The program length necessary to describe an object, Kolmogorov complexity, plays the most fundamental role in the theory. In the context of algorithmic information theory, we formulate a security criterion for the quantum key distribution by using the quantum Kolmogorov complexity that was recently defined by Vit\'anyi. We show that a simple BB84 protocol indeed distribute a binary sequence between Alice and Bob that looks almost random for Eve with a probability exponentially close to 1.

**12.    Coherent shift of localized bound pair in Bose Hubbard model**  
L. Jin, B. Chen, Z. Song  
PRA 79, 032108 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2705  
<blockquote>
<p>
Based on the exact results obtained by Bethe ansatz, we demonstrate the existence of stable bound pair (BP) wave packet in Bose Hubbard model with arbitrary on-site interaction U. In large-U regime, it is found that an incoming single-particle (SP) can coherently pass through a BP wave packet and leave a coherent shift in the position of it. This suggests a simple scheme for constructing a BP charge qubit to realize a quantum switch, which is capable of controlling the coherent transport of one and only one photon in a one-dimensional waveguide.

**13.    Solution to Satisfiability problem by a complete Grover search with trapped ions**  
W. L. Yang, H. Wei, F. Zhou, W. L. Chang, M. Feng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2905  
<blockquote>
<p>
The main idea in the original Grover search (Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 325 (1997)) is to single out a target state containing the solution to a search problem by amplifying the amplitude of the state, following the Oracle's job, i.e., a black box giving us information about the target state. We design quantum circuits to accomplish a complete Grover search involving both the Oracle's job and the amplification of the target state, which are employed to solve Satisfiability (SAT) problems. We explore how to carry out the quantum circuits by currently available ion-trap quantum computing technology.

**14.    The Detectability Lemma and Quantum Gap Amplification**  
Dorit Aharonov, Itai Arad, Zeph Landau, Umesh Vazirani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3412  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum analogue of a constraint satisfaction problem is a sum of local Hamiltonians - each local Hamiltonian specifies a local constraint whose violation contributes to the energy of the given quantum state. Formalizing the intuitive connection between the ground (minimal) energy of the Hamiltonian and the minimum number of violated constraints is problematic, since the number of constraints being violated is not well defined when the terms in the Hamiltonian do not commute. The detectability lemma proved in this paper provides precisely such a quantitative connection. We apply the lemma to derive a quantum analogue of a basic primitive in classical complexity: amplification of probabilities by random walks on expander graphs. It holds under the restriction that the interaction graph of the local Hamiltonian is an expander. Our proofs are based on a novel structure imposed on the Hilbert space that we call the $XY$ decomposition, which enables a reduction from the quantum non-commuting case to the commuting case (where many classical arguments go through). The results may have several interesting implications. First, proving a quantum analogue to the PCP theorem is one of the most important challenges in quantum complexity theory. Our quantum gap amplification lemma may be viewed as the quantum analogue of the first of the three main steps in Dinur's PCP proof. Quantum gap amplification may also be related to spectral gap amplification, and in particular, to fault tolerance of adiabatic computation. Finally, the detectability lemma, and the $XY$ decomposition provide a handle on the structure of local Hamiltonians and their ground states.

**15.    A note on quantum error correction with continuous variables**  
Peter van Loock  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3616  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that continuous-variable quantum error correction based on Gaussian ancilla states and Gaussian operations (for encoding, syndrome extraction, and recovery) can be very useful to suppress the effect of non-Gaussian error channels. For a certain class of stochastic error models, reminiscent of those typically considered in the qubit case, quantum error correction codes designed for single-channel errors may enhance the transfer fidelities even when errors occur in every channel employed for transmitting the encoded state. In fact, in this case, the error-correcting capability of the continuous-variable scheme turns out to be higher than that of its discrete-variable analogues.

**16.    Quantum error correction beyond qubits**  
Takao Aoki, Go Takahashi, Tadashi Kajiya, Jun-ichi Yoshikawa, Samuel L. Braunstein, Peter van Loock, Akira Furusawa  
Nature Physics 5, 541 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3734  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation and communication rely on the ability to manipulate quantum states robustly and with high fidelity. Thus, some form of error correction is needed to protect fragile quantum superposition states from corruption by so-called decoherence noise. Indeed, the discovery of quantum error correction (QEC) turned the field of quantum information from an academic curiosity into a developing technology. Here we present a continuous-variable experimental implementation of a QEC code, based upon entanglement among 9 optical beams. In principle, this 9-wavepacket adaptation of Shor's original 9-qubit scheme allows for full quantum error correction against an arbitrary single-beam (single-party) error.

**17.    Lie-Semigroup Structures for Reachability and Control of Open Quantum Systems: Viewing Markovian Quantum Channels as Lie Semigroups and GKS-Lindblad Generators as Lie Wedge**  
G. Dirr, U. Helmke, I. Kurniawan, T. Schulte-Herbrueggen  
Rep. Math. Phys. 64 (2009) 93--121  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3906  
<blockquote>
<p>
In view of controlling finite dimensional open quantum systems, we provide a unified Lie-semigroup framework describing the structure of completely positive trace-preserving maps. It allows (i) to identify the Kossakowski-Lindblad generators as the Lie wedge of a subsemigroup, (ii) to link properties of Lie semigroups such as divisibility with Markov properties of quantum channels, and (iii) to characterise reachable sets and controllability in open systems. We elucidate when time-optimal controls derived for the analogous closed system already give good fidelities in open systems and when a more detailed knowledge of the open system (e.g., in terms of the parameters of its Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation) is actually required for state-of-the-art optimal-control algorithms. -- As an outlook, we sketch the structure of a new, potentially more efficient numerical approach explicitly making use of the corresponding Lie wedge.

New Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 055014 (13pp)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4185  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally and theoretically investigate the dephasing rates of the coherent evolution of a resonantly driven pseudo spin emersed in a reservoir of pseudo spins. The pseudo spin is realized by optically exciting 87 Rb atoms to a Rydberg state. Hence, the upper spin states are coupled via the strong van der Waals interaction. Two different experimental techniques to measure the dephasing rates are shown: the 'rotary echo' technique known from nuclear magnetic resonance physics and electromagnetically induced transparency. The experiments are performed in a dense frozen Rydberg gas, either confined in a magnetic trap or in an optical dipole trap. Additionally, a numerical simulation is used to analyse the dephasing in the rotary echo experiments.

**19.    Efficient discrete-time simulations of continuous-time quantum query algorithms**  
R. Cleve, D. Gottesman, M. Mosca, R.D. Somma, D.L. Yonge-Mallo  
Proc. 41st Ann. Symp. on Theory of Computing, 409-416 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4428  
<blockquote>
<p>
The continuous-time query model is a variant of the discrete query model in which queries can be interleaved with known operations (called "driving operations") continuously in time. Interesting algorithms have been discovered in this model, such as an algorithm for evaluating nand trees more efficiently than any classical algorithm. Subsequent work has shown that there also exists an efficient algorithm for nand trees in the discrete query model; however, there is no efficient conversion known for continuous-time query algorithms for arbitrary problems. We show that any quantum algorithm in the continuous-time query model whose total query time is T can be simulated by a quantum algorithm in the discrete query model that makes O[T log(T) / log(log(T))] queries. This is the first upper bound that is independent of the driving operations (i.e., it holds even if the norm of the driving Hamiltonian is very large). A corollary is that any lower bound of T queries for a problem in the discrete-time query model immediately carries over to a lower bound of \Omega[T log(log(T))/log (T)] in the continuous-time query model.

**20.    Complete Characterization of Mixing Time for the Continuous Quantum Walk on the Hypercube with Markovian Decoherence Model**  
Milosh Drezgich, Andrew P. Hines, Mohan Sarovar, Shankar Sastry  
Quantum Inf. & Comp., vol. 9, p. 856 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4472  
<blockquote>
<p>
The n-dimensional hypercube quantum random walk (QRW) is a particularily appealing example of a quantum walk because it has a natural implementation on a register on $n$ qubits. However, any real implementation will encounter decoherence effects due to interactions with uncontrollable degrees of freedom. We present a complete characterization of the mixing properties of the hypercube QRW under a physically relevant Markovian decoherence model. In the local decoherence model considered the non-unitary dynamics are modeled as a sum of projections on individual qubits to an arbitrary direction on the Bloch sphere. We prove that there is always classical (asymptotic) mixing in this model and specify the conditions under which instantaneous mixing \textit{always} exists. And we show that the latter mixing property, as well as the classical mixing time, depend heavily on the exact environmental interaction and its strength. Therefore, algorithmic applications of the QRW on the hypercube, if they intend to employ mixing properties, need to consider both the walk dynamics and the precise decoherence model.

**21.    Strength and Weakness in Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm**  
Ahmed Younes  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4481  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover's quantum search algorithm is considered as one of the milestone in the field of quantum computing. The algorithm can search for a single match in a database with $N$ records in $O(\sqrt{N})$ assuming that the item must exist in the database with quadratic speedup over the best known classical algorithm. This review paper discusses the performance of Grover's algorithm in case of multiple matches where the problem is expected to be easier. Unfortunately, we will find that the algorithm will fail for $M>3N/4$, where $M$ is the number of matches in the list.

**22.    Possible Minkowskian Language in Two-level Systems**  
Y. S. Kim  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0970  
<blockquote>
<p>
One hundred years ago, in 1908, Hermann Minkowski completed his proof that Maxwell's equations are covariant under Lorentz transformations. During this process, he introduced a four-dimensional space called the Minkowskian space. In 1949, P. A. M. Dirac showed the Minkowskian space can be handled with the light-cone coordinate system with squeeze transformations. While the squeeze is one of the fundamental mathematical operations in optical sciences, it could serve useful purposes in two-level systems. Some possibilities are considered in this report. It is shown possible to cross the light-cone boundary in optical and two-level systems while it is not possible in Einstein's theory of relativity.

**23.    The quantum optical Josephson interferometer**

NATURE PHYSICS vol. 5, pp. 281-284 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3762  
<blockquote>
<p>
The interplay between coherent tunnel coupling and on-site interactions in dissipation-free bosonic systems has lead to many spectacular observations, ranging from the demonstration of number-phase uncertainty relation to quantum phase transitions. To explore the effect of dissipation and coherent drive on tunnel coupled interacting bosonic systems, we propose a device that is the quantum optical analog of a Josephson interferometer. It consists of two coherently driven linear optical cavities connected via a central cavity with a single-photon nonlinearity. The Josephson-like oscillations in the light emitted from the central cavity as a function of the phase difference between two pumping fields can be suppressed by increasing the strength of the nonlinear coupling. Remarkably, we find that in the limit of ultra-strong interactions in the center-cavity, the coupled system maps on to an effective Jaynes-Cummings system with a nonlinearity determined by the tunnel coupling strength. In the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear waveguides, the degree of photon antibunching from the nonlinear cavity provides an excellent measure of the transition to the nonlinear regime where Josephson oscillations are suppressed.
