**1.    Spectral analysis of a selected non self-adjoint Hamiltonian in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space**  
Natalia Bebiano, Joao da Providencia, Joao P. da Providencia  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.00653  
<blockquote>
<p>
The so-called equation of motion method is useful to obtain the explicit form of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of certain non self-adjoint bosonic Hamiltonians with real eigenvalues. These operators can be diagonalized when they are expressed in terms of pseudo-bosons, which do not behave as ordinary bosons under the adjoint transformation, but obey the Weil-Heisenberg commutation relations.

<blockquote>
<p>
Improvement in secure transmission of information is an urgent practical need for governments, corporations and individuals. Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations and even deployment of commercial systems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and practical large-scale deployment will likely require integrated chip-based devices for improved performance, miniaturisation and enhanced functionality, fully integrated into classical communication networks. Here we report low error rate, GHz clocked QKD operation of an InP transmitter chip and a SiO$_x$N$_y$ receiver chip --- monolithically integrated devices that use state-of-the-art components and manufacturing processes from the telecom industry. We use the reconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three important QKD protocols --- BB84, Coherent One Way (COW) and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) --- with performance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with integrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the levels of future QKD networks --- from point-of-use through to backbone --- and open the way to operation in existing and emerging classical communication networks.

**3.    Symmetries of general non-Markovian Gaussian diffusive unravelings**  
Adrian A. Budini  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.00889  
<blockquote>
<p>
By using a condition of average trace preservation we derive a general class of non-Markovian Gaussian diffusive unravelings [L. Diosi and L. Ferialdi, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{113}, 200403 (2014)], here valid for arbitrary non-Hermitian system operators and noise correlations. The conditions under which the generalized stochastic Schrodinger equation has the same symmetry properties (invariance under unitary changes of operator base) than a microscopic system-bath Hamiltonian dynamics are determined. While the standard quantum diffusion model (standard noise correlations) always share the same invariance symmetry, the generalized stochastic dynamics can be mapped with an arbitrary bosonic environment only if some specific correlation constraints are fulfilled. These features are analyzed for different non-Markovian unravelings equivalent in average. Results based on quantum measurement theory that lead to specific cases of the generalized dynamics [J. Gambetta and H. M. Wiseman, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{66}, 012108 (2002)]\ are studied from the perspective of the present analysis.

**4.    Suitable bases for quantum walks with Wigner coins**  
Iva Bezdekova, Martin Stefanak, Igor Jex  
Phys. Rev. A 92, 022347 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.00960  
<blockquote>
<p>
The analysis of a physical problem simplifies considerably when one uses a suitable coordinate system. We apply this approach to the discrete-time quantum walks with coins given by $2j+1$-dimensional Wigner rotation matrices (Wigner walks), a model which was introduced in T. Miyazaki et al., Phys. Rev. A 76, 012332 (2007). First, we show that from the three parameters of the coin operator only one is physically relevant for the limit density of the Wigner walk. Next, we construct a suitable basis of the coin space in which the limit density of the Wigner walk acquires a much simpler form. This allows us to identify various dynamical regimes which are otherwise hidden in the standard basis description. As an example, we show that it is possible to find an initial state which reduces the number of peaks in the probability distribution from generic $2j+1$ to a single one. Moreover, the models with integer $j$ lead to the trapping effect. The derived formula for the trapping probability reveals that it can be highly asymmetric and it deviates from purely exponential decay. Explicit results are given up to the dimension five.

**5.    Dynamic Entanglement Evolution of Two-qubit XYZ Spin Chain in Markovian Environment**  
Ren Yi-Chong, Fan Hong-Yi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01001  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new approach called Ket-Bra Entangled State (KBES) Method for converting master equation into Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation. With this method, we investigate decoherence process and entanglement dynamics induced by a $2$-qubit spin chain that each qubit coupled with reservoir. The spin chain is an anisotropy $XYZ$ Heisenberg model in the external magnetic field $B$, the corresponding master equation is solved concisely by KBES method; Furthermore, the effects of anisotropy, temperature, external field and initial state on concurrence dynamics is analyzed in detail for the case that initial state is Extended Wenger-Like(EWL) state. Finally we research the coherence and concurrence of the final state (namely the density operator for time tend to infinite)

**6.    Universal set of Dynamically Protected Gates for Bipartite Qubit Networks II: Soft Pulse Implementation of the [[5,1,3]] Quantum Error Correcting Code**  
Amrit De, Leonid P. Pryadko  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01239  
<blockquote>
<p>
We model repetitive quantum error correction (QEC) with the single-error-correcting five-qubit code on a network of individually-controlled qubits with always-on Ising couplings, using our previously designed universal set of quantum gates based on sequences of shaped decoupling pulses. In addition to serving as accurate quantum gates, the sequences also provide dynamical decoupling (DD) of low-frequency phase noise. The simulation involves integrating unitary dynamics of six qubits over the duration of tens of thousands of control pulses, using classical stochastic phase noise as a source of decoherence. The combined DD/QEC protocol dramatically improves the coherence, with the QEC alone responsible for more than an order of magnitude infidelity reduction.

**7.    Collective scattering and oscillation modes of optically bound point particles trapped in a single mode waveguide field**  
Daniela Holzmann, Helmut Ritsch  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01435  
<blockquote>
<p>
Collective coherent scattering of laser light induces strong light forces between polarizable point particles. These dipole forces are strongly enhanced in magnitude and distance within the field of an optical waveguide so that at low temperature the particles self-order in strongly bound regular patterns. The stationary configurations typically exhibit super-radiant scattering with strong particle and light confinement. Here we study collective excitations of such self-consistent crystalline particle-light structures as function of particle number and pump strength. Multiple scattering and absorption modify the collective particle-field eigenfrequencies and create eigenmodes of surprisingly complex nature. For larger arrays this often leads to dynamical instabilities and disintegration of the structures even if additional damping is present.

**8.    A Compiler for Fault-Tolerant High Level Quantum Circuits**  
Alexandru Paler, Ilia Polian, Kae Nemoto, Simon J. Devitt  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02004  
<blockquote>
<p>
Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is an absolute necessity for any quantum architecture destined to tackle interesting, large-scale quantum algorithms. The theoretical formalism of quantum error correction codes, fault-tolerant circuit constructions, gate decompositions and relevant optimisations have been well founded for nearly two decades. However, at this point we still do not have a reliable compiler to adapt a high level circuit description to a fully fault-tolerant, error corrected description. There are many technical hurdles to this, including dynamic circuit constructions that occur due to teleportation protocols necessary to achieve fault-tolerance with commonly used error correction codes. We combine multiple results to develop a package that takes any high level quantum circuit consisting of CNOT, Toffoli, Controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ and arbitrary single qubit rotations and converts it to a equivalent quantum circuit employing ancillary protocols needed for fault-tolerant error correction. We call this representation the (I)initialisation, (C)NOT, (M)measurement representation (ICM) and consists of an initialisation layer of qubits into one of four distinct states, a massive array of CNOT operations that implement the relevant algorithmic decompositions and fault-tolerant ancillary protocols and a series of time ordered $X$- and $Z$-basis measurements. Our package will output either a standard circuit description or a canonical geometric structure that represents its implementation for topological quantum codes that can be further optimised and implemented on actual quantum hardware.

**9.    Quantum walk speedup of backtracking algorithms**  
Ashley Montanaro  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02374  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a general method to obtain quantum speedups of classical algorithms which are based on the technique of backtracking, a standard approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Backtracking algorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an attempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking algorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none exists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex corresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T) n^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to speed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient SAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a quantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree. We also discuss how, for certain distributions on the inputs, the algorithm can lead to an average-case exponential speedup.

**10.    Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations of Tunneling in Quantum Adiabatic Optimization**  
Lucas T. Brady, Wim van Dam  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02562  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore to what extent path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods can efficiently simulate the tunneling behavior of quantum adiabatic optimization algorithms. Specifically we look at symmetric cost functions defined over n bits with a single potential barrier that a successful optimization algorithm will have to tunnel through. The height and width of this barrier depend on n, and by tuning these dependencies, we can make the optimization algorithm succeed or fail in polynomial time. In this article we compare the strength of quantum adiabatic tunneling with that of path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods. We find numerical evidence that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms will succeed in the same regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds.

**11.    Spin models and boson sampling**  
Borja Peropadre, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02703  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we proof that boson sampling with $N$ particles in $M$ modes is equivalent to short-time evolution with $N$ excitations in an XY model of $2N$ spins. This mapping is efficient whenever the boson bunching probability is small, and errors can be efficiently postselected. This mapping opens the door to boson sampling with quantum simulators or general purpose quantum computers, and highlights the complexity of time-evolution with critical spin models, even for very short times.

**12.    Characterizing a Four-Qubit Planar Lattice for Arbitrary Error Detection**  
Jerry M. Chow, Srikanth J. Srinivasan, Easwar Magesan, A D. Corcoles, David W. Abraham, Jay M. Gambetta, Matthias Steffen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02815  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction will be a necessary component towards realizing scalable quantum computers with physical qubits. Theoretically, it is possible to perform arbitrarily long computations if the error rate is below a threshold value. The two-dimensional surface code permits relatively high fault-tolerant thresholds at the ~1% level, and only requires a latticed network of qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. Superconducting qubits have continued to steadily improve in coherence, gate, and readout fidelities, to become a leading candidate for implementation into larger quantum networks. Here we describe characterization experiments and calibration of a system of four superconducting qubits arranged in a planar lattice, amenable to the surface code. Insights into the particular qubit design and comparison between simulated parameters and experimentally determined parameters are given. Single- and two-qubit gate tune-up procedures are described and results for simultaneously benchmarking pairs of two-qubit gates are given. All controls are eventually used for an arbitrary error detection protocol described in separate work [Corcoles et al., Nature Communications, 6, 2015]

**13.    Introduction to Quantum Gate Set Tomography**  
Daniel Greenbaum  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02921  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.

**14.    Making Existential-Unforgeable Signatures Strongly Unforgeable in the Quantum Random-Oracle Model**  
Edward Eaton, Fang Song  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02944  
<blockquote>
<p>
Strongly unforgeable signature schemes provide a more stringent security guarantee than the standard existential unforgeability. It requires that not only forging a signature on a new message is hard, it is infeasible as well to produce a new signature on a message for which the adversary has seen valid signatures before. Strongly unforgeable signatures are useful both in practice and as a building block in many cryptographic constructions. This work investigates a generic transformation that compiles any existential-unforgeable scheme into a strongly unforgeable one, which was proposed by Teranishi et al. and was proven in the classical random-oracle model. Our main contribution is showing that the transformation also works against quantum adversaries in the quantum random-oracle model. We develop proof techniques such as adaptively programming a quantum random-oracle in a new setting, which could be of independent interest. Applying the transformation to an existential-unforgeable signature scheme due to Cash et al., which can be shown to be quantum-secure assuming certain lattice problems are hard for quantum computers, we get an efficient quantum-secure strongly unforgeable signature scheme in the quantum random-oracle model.

**15.    Doubled Color Codes**  
Sergey Bravyi, Andrew Cross  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03239  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to perform a fault-tolerant universal quantum computation in 2D architectures using only transversal unitary operators and local syndrome measurements. Our approach is based on a doubled version of the 2D color code. It enables a transversal implementation of all logical gates in the Clifford+T basis using the gauge fixing method proposed recently by Paetznick and Reichardt. The gauge fixing requires six-qubit parity measurements for Pauli operators supported on faces of the honeycomb lattice with two qubits per site. Doubled color codes are promising candidates for the experimental demonstration of logical gates since they do not require state distillation. Secondly, we propose a Maximum Likelihood algorithm for the error correction and gauge fixing tasks that enables a numerical simulation of logical circuits in the Clifford+T basis. The algorithm can be used in the online regime such that a new error syndrome is revealed at each time step. We estimate the average number of logical gates that can be implemented reliably for the smallest doubled color code and a toy noise model that includes depolarizing memory errors and syndrome measurement errors.

**16.    Cavity-enhanced simultaneous dressing of quantum dot exciton and biexciton states**  
Fabian Hargart, Markus Müller, Kaushik Roy-Choudhury, Simone Luca Portalupi, Christian Schneider, Sven H?fling, Martin Kamp, Stephen Hughes, Peter Michler  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03861  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the simultaneous dressing of both vacuum-to-exciton and exciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot in a high-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by spectrally tuning the quantum dot emission with respect to the cavity mode. The cavity couples to both transitions and amplifies the Rabi-frequency of the likewise resonant cw laser, driving the transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the emission lines, which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the cavity-laser detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom correctly predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission spectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further provided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for cavity coupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor medium.

**17.    The Localization in Quantum Walks on a Honeycomb Network**  
Changyuan Lyu, Luyan Yu, Shengjun Wu  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03919  
<blockquote>
<p>
We systematically study the localization effect in discrete-time quantum walks on a honeycomb network and establish the mathematical framework. We focus on the Grover walk first and rigorously derive the limit form of the walker's state, showing it has a certain probability to be localized at the starting position. The relationship between localization and the initial coin state is concisely represented by a linear map. We also define and calculate the average probability of localization by generating random initial states. Further, coin operators varying with positions are considered and the sufficient condition for localization is discussed. We also similarly analyze another four-state Grover walk. Theoretical predictions are all in accord with numerical simulation results. Finally, our results are compared with previous works to demonstrate the unusual trapping effect of quantum walks on a honeycomb network, as well as the advantages of our method.

**18.    Quantum Langevin approach for non-Markovian quantum dynamics of the spin-boson model**  
Zheng-Yang Zhou, Mi Chen, Ting Yu, J. Q. You  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.03973  
<blockquote>
<p>
One long-standing difficult problem in quantum dissipative dynamics is to solve the spin-boson model in a non-Markovian regime where a tractable systematic master equation does not exist. The spin-boson model is particularly important due to its crucial applications in quantum noise control and manipulation as well as its central role in developing quantum theories of open systems. Here we solve this important model by developing a non-Markovian quantum Langevin approach. By projecting the quantum Langevin equation onto the coherent states of the bath, we can derivie a set of non-Markovian quantum Bloch equations containing no explicit noise variables. This special feature offers a tremendous advantage over the existing stochastic Schr\"odinger equations in numerical simulations. The physical significance and generality of our approach are briefly discussed.

Davide Girolami, Benjamin Yadin  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04131  
<blockquote>
<p>
The characterization of quantum coherence in the context of quantum information theory and its interplay with quantum correlations is currently subject of intense study. Several theoretical quantifiers of coherence have been proposed, and links to quantum correlation measures have been provided. We here propose an experimental strategy to witness the presence of entanglement in multipartite systems by evaluating coherence. We test our scheme by simulating coherence and entanglement detection in a three-qubit GHZ-diagonal state.

**20.    Quantum estimation via parametric amplification in circuit QED arrays**  
Ashley Wilkins, Carlos Sabín  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04142  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for quantum estimation by means of parametric amplification in circuit Quantum Electrodynamics. The modulation of a SQUID interrupting a superconducting waveguide transforms an initial thermal two-mode squeezed state in such a way that the new state is sensitive to the features of the parametric amplifier. We find the optimal initial parameters which maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. In order to achieve a large number of independent measurements we propose to use an array of non-interacting resonators. We show that the combination of both large QFI and large number of measurements enables -in principle- the use of this setup for Quantum Metrology applications.

**21.    Discrete dynamics and non-Markovianity**  
Kimmo Luoma, Jyrki Piilo  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04231  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study discrete quantum dynamics where single evolution step consists of unitary system transformation followed by decoherence via coupling to an environment. Often non-Markovian memory effects are attributed to structured environments whereas here we take a more general approach within discrete setting. In addition of controlling the structure of the environment, we are interested in how local unitaries on the open system allow the appearance and control of memory effects. Our first simple qubit model, where local unitary is followed by dephasing, illustrates how memory effects arise despite of having no-structure in the environment the system is coupled with. We then elaborate this observation by constructing a model for open quantum walk where the unitary coin and transfer operation is augmented with dephasing of the coin. The results demonstrate that in the limit of strong dephasing within each evolution step, the combined coin-position open system always displays memory effects and their quantity is independent of the structure of the environment. Our construction makes possible an experimentally realizable open quantum walk with photons exhibiting non-Markovian features.

Kenzo Makino, Yosuke Hashimoto, Jun-ichi Yoshikawa, Hideaki Ohdan, Takeshi Toyama, Peter van Loock, Akira Furusawa  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04409  
<blockquote>
<p>
A fundamental element of quantum information processing with photonic qubits is the nonclassical quantum interference between two photons when they bunch together via the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect. Ultimately, many such pure photons must be processed in complex interferometric networks, and for this it is essential to synchronize the arrival times of the flying photons preserving their purity. Here we demonstrate for the first time the HOM interference of two heralded, pure optical photons synchronized through two independent quantum memories. Controlled storage times up to 1.8 microseconds for about 90 events per second were achieved with purities sufficiently high for a negative Wigner function confirmed with homodyne measurements.

**23.    Three-step implementation of any nxn unitary with a complete graph of n qubits**  
Amara Katabarwa, Michael R. Geller  
Physical Review A 92, 032306 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04621  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation with a complete graph of superconducting qubits has been recently proposed, and applications to amplitude amplification, phase estimation, and the simulation of realistic atomic collisions given [Phys. Rev. A 91, 062309 (2015)]. This single-excitation subspace (SES) approach does not require error correction and is practical now. Previously it was shown how to implement symmetric nxn unitaries in a single step, but not general unitaries. Here we show that any element in the unitary group U(n) can be executed in no more than three steps, for any n. This enables the implementation of highly complex operations in constant time, and in some cases even allows for the compilation of an entire algorithm down to only three operations. Using this protocol we show how to prepare any pure state of an SES chip in three steps, and also how to compute, for a given SES state rho, the expectation value of any nxn Hermitian observable O in a constant number of steps.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05098  
<blockquote>
<p>
Controlling the properties of single photons is essential for a wide array of emerging optical quantum technologies spanning quantum sensing, quantum computing, and quantum communications. Essential components for these technologies include single photon sources, quantum memories, waveguides, and detectors. The ideal spectral operating parameters (wavelength and bandwidth) of these components are rarely similar; thus, frequency conversion and spectral control are key enabling steps for component hybridization. Here we perform signal processing of single photons by coherently manipulating their spectra via a modified quantum memory. We store 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm bandwidth, in a room-temperature diamond crystal; upon retrieval we demonstrate centre frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth modulation between 0.5 to 1.9 times the input bandwidth. Our results demonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, to be an integrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.

Andreas Maser, Benjamin Gmeiner, Tobias Utikal, Stephan G?tzinger, Vahid Sandoghdar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05216  
<blockquote>
<p>
The pioneering experiments of linear spectroscopy were performed using flames in the 1800s, but nonlinear optical measurements had to wait until lasers became available in the twentieth century. Because the nonlinear cross section of materials is very small, usually macroscopic bulk samples and pulsed lasers are used. Numerous efforts have explored coherent nonlinear signal generation from individual nanoparticles or small atomic ensembles with millions of atoms. Experiments on a single semiconductor quantum dot have also been reported, albeit with a very small yield. Here, we report on coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of a single molecule under continuous-wave single-pass illumination, where efficient photon-molecule coupling in a tight focus allows switching of a laser beam by less than a handful of pump photons nearly resonant with the sharp molecular transition. Aside from their fundamental importance, our results emphasize the potential of organic molecules for applications such as quantum information processing, which require strong nonlinearities.

Antti Karlsson, Henri Lyyra, Elsi-Mari Laine, Sabrina Maniscalco, Jyrki Piilo  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05307  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the performance of two measures of non-Markovianity in detecting memory effects in two-qubit dephasing channels. By combining independent Markovian and non-Markovian noise on the qubits, our results show that the trace distance measure is able to detect the memory effects when at least one of the local channels displays non-Markovianity. A measure based on channel capacity, in turn, becomes non-zero when the global two-qubit dynamics shows memory effects. We apply these schemes to a well-known superdense coding protocol and demonstrate an optimal noise configuration to maximize the information transmission with independent local noises.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05450  
<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to characterize static and time-dependent electric fields in situ is an important prerequisite for quantum-optics experiments with atoms close to surfaces. Especially in experiments which aim at coupling Rydberg atoms to the near field of superconducting circuits, the identification and subsequent elimination of sources of stray fields is crucial. We present a technique that allows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions $(F^\text{str}_\text{x}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{y}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{z}(\vec{r}))$ at distances of less than $2~\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using coherent Rydberg-Stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable $1\text{s}^12\text{s}^1~{}^{1}S_{0}$ helium atoms. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field emanating from a structured superconducting surface. Exploiting coherent population transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the same technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution above the surface.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05470  
<blockquote>
<p>
Leakage errors occur when a quantum system leaves the two-level qubit subspace. Reducing these errors is critically important for quantum error correction to be viable. To quantify leakage errors, we use randomized benchmarking in conjunction with measurement of the leakage population. We characterize single qubit gates in a superconducting qubit, and by refining our use of Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse shaping along with detuning of the pulses, we obtain gate errors consistently below $10^{-3}$ and leakage rates at the $10^{-5}$ level. With the control optimized, we find that a significant portion of the remaining leakage is due to incoherent heating of the qubit.

<p>
We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for implementation of a maximally entangling quantum controlled-Z gate between two weakly interacting systems. We conditionally enhance the interqubit coupling by quantum interference. Both before and after the interqubit interaction, one of the qubits is coherently coupled to an auxiliary quantum system, and finally it is projected back onto qubit subspace. We experimentally verify the practical feasibility of this technique by using a linear optical setup with weak interferometric coupling between single-photon qubits. Our procedure is universally applicable to a wide range of physical platforms including hybrid systems such as atomic clouds or optomechanical oscillators coupled to light.

<blockquote>
<p>
Extending the single photon transmission distance is a basic requirement for the implementation of quantum communication on a global scale. In this work we report the single photon exchange from a medium Earth orbit satellite (MEO) at more than 7000 km of slanted distance to the ground station at the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory. The single photon transmitter was realized by exploiting the corner cube retro-reflectors mounted on the LAGEOS-2 satellite. Long duration of data collection is possible with such altitude, up to 43 minutes in a single passage. The mean number of photons per pulse ({\mu}sat) has been limited to 1 for 200 seconds, resulting in an average detection rate of 3.0 cps and a signal to noise ratio of 1.5. The feasibility of single photon exchange from MEO satellites paves the way to tests of Quantum Mechanics in moving frames and to global Quantum Information.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present an extension of the discrete time quantum walk on a graph to include a qubit at each vertex of the graph, with which the walker interacts at each time step. We show that allowing for a controlled-Z interaction between the walker and the vertex qubits generates multipartite entanglement between the qubits. We demonstrate that for particular coin operators the system generates a highly entangled cluster state, of use in one way quantum computation.

**32.    Thermal Baths as Quantum Resources: More Friends than Foes?**  
Gershon Kurizki, Ephraim Shahmoon, Analia Zwick  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06318  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we argue that thermal reservoirs (baths) are potentially useful resources in processes involving atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic fields and their applications to quantum technologies. One may try to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such control does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take advantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate "quantumness" in the system-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued by us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the bath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal quasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest by the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical control methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the quantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring quantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful for fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling of quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom coupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows to drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the mediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to achieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the conventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii) Engineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a prerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum heat machines (engines and refrigerators). We may thus conclude that often thermal baths are "more friends than foes" in quantum technologies.

**34.    Exact Analysis of the Response of Quantum Systems to Two Photons Using a QSDE Approach**  
Yu Pan, Daoyi Dong, Guofeng Zhang  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06934  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the quantum differential stochastic equation (QSDE) approach to exactly analyze of the response of quantum systems to a continuous-mode two-photon input. The QSDE description of the two-photon process allows us to integrate the input-output analysis with the quantum network theory, and so the analytical computability of the output state of a general quantum system can be addressed within this framework. We show that the time-domain two-photon output states can be exactly calculated for a large class of quantum systems including passive linear networks, optomechanical oscillators and two-level emitter in waveguide systems. In particular, we propose to utilize the results for the exact simulation of the stimulated emission as well as the study of the scattering of two-mode photon wave packets.

Pradip Laha, B. Sudarsan, S. Lakshmibala, V. Balakrishnan  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06952  
<blockquote>
<p>
A system comprising a $\Lambda$-type or V-type atom interacting with two radiation fields exhibits, during its dynamical evolution, interesting optical phenomena such as electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and a variety of nonclassical effects. Signatures of the latter are seen in the entanglement dynamics of the atomic subsystem and in appropriate field observables. Some of these effects have been experimentally detected, and have even been used to change the nonlinear optical properties of certain atomic media. It is therefore useful to investigate the roles played by specific initial states of the radiation fields, detuning parameters, field nonlinearities and the nature of field-atom couplings on EIT and on the entanglement between subsystems. We investigate these aspects in the framework of a simple model that captures the salient features of such tripartite entangled systems. Entanglement dynamics is shown to be very sensitive to the intensity-dependent atom-field couplings. Unexpected interesting features pertaining to the collapses and revivals of the atomic subsystem von Neumann entropy appear. These features could, in principle, be useful in enabling entanglement.

**36.    Quantum Walk on the Line through Potential Barriers**  
Thomas G. Wong  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.07112  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are well-known for their ballistic dispersion, traveling $\Theta(t)$ away in $t$ steps, which is quadratically faster than a classical random walk's diffusive spreading. In physical implementations of the walk, however, the particle may need to tunnel through a potential barrier to hop, and a naive calculation suggests this could eliminate the ballistic transport. We show by explicit calculation, however, that such a loss does not occur. Rather, the $\Theta(t)$ dispersion is retained, with only the coefficient changing, which additionally gives a way to detect and quantify the hopping errors in experiments.

We analyzed the ground-state stability of quantum systems via a control-theoretical formation of Lyapunov methods in the Heisenberg picture. The Lyapunov stability formalism proposed in this paper can be conveniently embedded into the framework of quantum computation and state engineering by dissipation control, where the task is to stabilize the ground state. We focus on a specific decomposition of the dissipation control, for which the scalability conditions of the Lyapunov method can be derived. Also we will show that the Lyapunov formalism is implicitly related to the stabilizer formalism for quantum error correction, in the sense that the dissipation control can be used for passive error correction in addition to stabilization.

Secure random numbers are a fundamental element of many applications in science, statistics, cryptography and more in general in security protocols. We present a method that enables the generation of high-speed unpredictable random numbers from the quadratures of an electromag- netic field without any assumption on the input state. The method allows to eliminate the numbers that can be predict due the presence of classical and quantum side information. In particular, we introduce a procedure to estimate a bound on the conditional min-entropy based on the Entropic Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum observables of infinite dimensional quantum sys- tems. By the above method, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of secure true random bits at a rate greater than 1 Gbit/s.

The implementation of a gradiometric SQUID loop allows for a fast tuning of the qubit transition frequency and therefore for full tomographic control of the quantum circuit. The presented qubit design features a passive direct Z coupling between neighboring qubits, being a pending quest in the field of quantum simulation.

**40.    Improvements about processing of measurement results in quantum repeater**  
Kenichiro Furuta  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08200  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum repeater protocols, measurements are performed in multiple relay points. Classical communications are used to convey the measurement results. It is important to improve the way of conveying the measurement results so that EPR pairs are not affected by noises during classical communications. One solution is execution in the blind mode. In the blind mode, correction operations of multiple ES operations and multiple EPP operations are performed in a lump after EPR pairs are shared between the sender and the receiver. That is, the following quantum operations are performed without performing correction operations of the former quantum operations. The protocol in the conventional blind mode uses concatenated CSS codes. Therefore, the number of qubits gets large as the communication distance gets long. This paper proposes quantum repeater protocols which can be executed in the blind mode and can be constructed by using CSS codes of single encoding. This result shows that posterior processing can reduce the size of encoded states in some cases. Additionally, the results of this paper show that posterior processing can improve performance of error corrections in some cases. The proposed protocol with single encoding can correct large errors by setting some assumptions. In contrast, blind mode with single encoding can deal with small errors if propositions in this paper are not used. The key ideas in posterior processing are decomposition of errors and computations for comparing EPR pairs of different length.

**41.    Dirac Quantum Cellular Automaton from Split-step Quantum Walk**  
Arindam Mallick, C. M. Chandrashekar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08851  
<blockquote>
<p>
Simulations of one quantum system by an other has an implications in realization of quantum machine that can imitate any quantum systems and solve problems that are not accessible to classical computers. One of the approach to engineer quantum simulations is to discretize the space-time degree of freedom in quantum dynamics and define the quantum cellular automata (QCA), a local unitary update rule on a lattice. Different models of QCA are constructed using different set of conditions which are not uniquely defined. The form of the operators in these model are not always in implementable configuration on an other system. Here, starting from a split-step discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) which are uniquely defined for experimental implementation, we recover the Dirac quantum cellular automaton (DQCA). This will bridge the connection between Dirac equation(DE)-DQCA-DTQW and eliminate the explicit use of invariance, symmetries and limiting range of parameter to establish the connections. For a combination of parameters defining the split-step DTQW, we will show the recovery of all the fine oscillation of the probability distribution in position observed in DQCA but not in conventional DTQW. We will also present the Zitterbewegung oscillations and quantify the entanglement as a function of that parameters that define split-step DTQW. The unique definition of DTQW along with the parameter tuneability demonstrated in experimental implementation will establish it as an efficient tool to design quantum simulator with access to different physical regime and approach quantum field theory from principles of quantum information theory.

Renato Portugal  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08852  
<blockquote>
<p>
Coined Quantum Walks (QWs) are being used in many contexts with the goal of understanding quantum systems and building quantum algorithms for quantum computers. Alternative models such as Szegedy's and continuous-time QWs were proposed taking advantage from the fact that quantum theory seems to allow different quantized versions based on the same classical model, in this case, the classical random walk. In this work we show the conditions upon which coined QWs are equivalent to Szegedy's QWs. Those QW models have in common a large class of instances, in the sense that the evolution operators are equal when we convert the graph on which the coined QW takes place into a bipartite graph on which Szegedy's QW takes place and vice versa. We also show that the abstract search algorithm using the coined QW model can be cast into Szegedy's searching framework using bipartite graphs with sinks.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we present a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) feedback control strategy for a class of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. The feedback control law is designed based on the estimated states of a whitening quantum filter for an augmented Markovian model of the non-Markovian open quantum systems. In this augmented Markovian model, an ancillary system plays the role of internal modes of the environment converting white noise into Lorentzian noise and a principal system obeys non-Markovian dynamics due to the direct interaction with the ancillary system. The simulation results show the LQG controller with the whitening filter obtains a better control performance than that with a Markovian filter in the problem of minimizing the photon numbers of the principal system when the ancillary system is disturbed by thermal noise.

<p>
We consider the number of quantum queries required to determine the coefficients of a degree-d polynomial over GF(q). A lower bound shown independently by Kane and Kutin and by Meyer and Pommersheim shows that d/2+1/2 quantum queries are needed to solve this problem with bounded error, whereas an algorithm of Boneh and Zhandry shows that d quantum queries are sufficient. We show that the lower bound is achievable: d/2+1/2 quantum queries suffice to determine the polynomial with bounded error. Furthermore, we show that d/2+1 queries suffice to achieve probability approaching 1 for large q. These upper bounds improve results of Boneh and Zhandry on the insecurity of cryptographic protocols against quantum attacks. We also show that our algorithm's success probability as a function of the number of queries is precisely optimal. Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented with gate complexity poly(log q) with negligible decrease in the success probability.

We find a strikingly different behavior between MBL and Anderson Localization. While the non-interacting Anderson case remains localized, in the interacting case any coupling between the tubes leads to a delocalization of the entire system.

Topology and geometry are essential to our understanding of modern physics, underlying many foundational concepts from high energy theories, quantum information, and condensed matter physics.

By realizing strong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines, we observe an evolution of band populations that is purely geometric in origin and directly reveals both the band geometry and dispersion relation. Our work constitutes the first reconstruction of Wilson lines in a band structure and enables a full determination of band eigenstates, Berry curvature, and topological invariants, including single- and multi-band Chern and $Z_2$ numbers.

The data enables the first demonstration measurement of optical absorption by DINW excitons which is differentiated from radiative background states formed by material disorder. This finding opens up the way to the possible engineering of these structures for single photon emitters and quantum devices at room temperature.

We investigate some particular completely positive maps which admit a stable commutative Von Neumann subalgebra. The restriction of such maps to the stable algebra is then a Markov operator.

We show that the existence of such an extension is linked with the existence of a special form of dilation for the Markov operator studied by Attal in \cite{Att1}, reducing the problem to the extension of dynamical system. We then apply our method to the same problem in continuous time, proving the existence of a quantum extension for L\'evy processes. In the second part of this article, we focus on the case where the commutative algebra is isomorphic to $\Acal=l^\infty(1,...,N)$ with $N$ either finite or infinite. We propose a classification of the CP maps leaving $\Acal$ stable, producing physical examples of each classes.

<p>
The possibility that anyons - quantum particles other than fermions or bosons - can emerge in condensed matter systems has motivated generations of physicists. In addition to being of fundamental scientific importance, so-called non-Abelian anyons are particularly sought-after for potential applications to quantum computing. However, experimental evidence of anyons in electronic systems remains inconclusive. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate non-Abelian braiding statistics by injecting coherent states of light into "topological guided modes" in specially-fabricated photonic waveguide arrays. These modes are photonic analogues of topological zero modes in electronic systems. Light traveling inside spatially well-separated topological guided modes can be braided, leading to the accumulation of non-Abelian phases. We propose an optical interference experiment to probe this non-Abelian braiding statistics directly.

We propose a physical realization of a commuting Hamiltonian of interacting Majorana fermions realizing $Z_{2}$ topological order, using an array of Josephson-coupled topological superconductor islands. The required multi-body interaction Hamiltonian is naturally generated by a combination of charging energy induced quantum phase-slips on the superconducting islands and electron tunneling. Our setup improves on a recent proposal for implementing a Majorana fermion surface code [1], a 'hybrid' approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation that combines (1) the engineering of a stabilizer Hamiltonian with a topologically ordered ground state with (2) projective stabilizer measurements to implement error correction and a universal set of logical gates. Our hybrid strategy has advantages over the traditional surface code architecture in error suppression and single-step stabilizer measurements, and is widely applicable to implementing stabilizer codes for quantum computation.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum-field-theoretical framework based on path integrals and Feynman diagrams for the investigation of the quantum-optical properties of one-dimensional waveguiding structures with embedded quantum impurities. In particular, we obtain the Green's functions for a waveguide with an embedded two-level system in the single- and two-excitation sector for arbitrary dispersion relations. In the single excitation sector, we show how to sum the diagrammatic perturbation series to all orders and thus obtain explicit expressions for physical quantities such as the spectral density and the scattering matrix. In the two-excitation sector, we show that strictly linear dispersion relations exhibit the special property that the corresponding diagrammatic perturbation series terminates after two terms, again allowing for closed-form expressions for physical quantities. In the case of general dispersion relations, notably those exhibiting a band edge or waveguide cut-off frequencies, the perturbation series cannot be summed explicitly. Instead, we derive a self-consistent T-matrix equation that reduces the computational effort to that of a single-excitation computation. This analysis allows us to identify a Fano resonance between the occupied quantum impurity and a free photon in the waveguide as a unique signature of the few-photon nonlinearity inherent in such systems. In addition, our diagrammatic approach allows for the classification of different physical processes such as the creation of photon-photon correlations and interaction-induced radiation trapping - the latter being absent for strictly linear dispersion relations. Our framework can serve as the basis for further studies that involve more complex scenarios such as several and many-level quantum impurities, networks of coupled waveguides, disordered systems, and non-equilibrium effects.

By adding a DC current and an RF pump tone we are able to generate parametric amplification using three-wave mixing. The devices exhibit gain of more than 15 dB across an instantaneous bandwidth from 4 to 8 GHz. The total usable gain bandwidth, including both sides of the signal-idler gain region, is more than 6 GHz. The noise referred to the input of the devices approaches the quantum limit, with less than 1 photon excess noise. Compared to similarly constructed four-wave mixing amplifiers, these devices operate with the RF pump at $\sim$20 dB lower power and at frequencies far from the signal. This will permit easier integration into large scale qubit and detector applications.
