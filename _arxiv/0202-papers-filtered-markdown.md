**1.    Quantum description of light pulse scattering on a single atom in waveguides**  
Peter Domokos, Peter Horak, Helmut Ritsch  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 033832 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202005  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a time dependent quantum calculation of the scattering of a few-photon pulse on a single atom. The photon wave packet is assumed to propagate in a transversely strongly confined geometry, which ensures strong atom-light coupling and allows a quasi 1D treatment. The amplitude and phase of the transmitted, reflected and transversely scattered part of the wave packet strongly depend on the pulse length (bandwidth) and energy. For a transverse mode size of the order of $\lambda^2$, we find nonlinear behavior for a few photons already, or even for a single photon. In a second step we study the collision of two such wave packets at the atomic site and find striking differences between Fock state and coherent state wave packets of the same photon number.

**2.    Exhibition of the periodicity of Quantum Fourier Transformation in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance**  
Xinhua Peng, Xiwen Zhu, Ximing Fang, Mang Feng, Xiaodong Yang, Maili Liu, Kelin Gao  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202010  
<blockquote>
<p>
The remarkable capability of quantum Fourier transformation (QFT) to extract the periodicity of a given periodic function has been exhibited by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Two separate sets of experiments were performed. In a full QFT, the periodicity were validated with state tomography and fidelity measurements. For a simplified QFT, the three-qubit pseudo-pure state was created by introducting an additional observer spin, and the spectra recorded on the observer spin showed intuitively the power of QFT\ to find the periodicity. Experimentally realizing the QFT provides a critical step to implement the renowned Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and many other algorithms. Moveover, it can be applied to the study of quantum chaos and other quantum information processing.

**3.    Fast fault-tolerant filtering of quantum codewords**  
Andrew M. Steane  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202036  
<blockquote>
<p>
The stabilization of a quantum computer by repeated error correction can be reduced almost entirely to repeated preparation of blocks of qubits in quantum codeword states. These are multi-particle entangled states with a high degree of symmetry. The required accuracy can be achieved by measuring parity checks, using imperfect apparatus, and rejecting states which fail them. This filtering process is considered for t-error-correcting codes with t>1. It is shown how to exploit the structure of the codeword and the check matrix, so that the filter is reduced to a minimal form where each parity check need only be measured once, not > t times by the (noisy) verification apparatus. This both raises the noise threshold and also reduces the physical size of the computer. A method based on latin rectangles is proposed, which enables the most parallel version of a logic gate network to be found, for a class of networks including those used in verification. These insights allowed the noise threshold to be increased by an order of magnitude.

**4.    Quantum Computation--The Ultimate Frontier**  
Chris Adami, Jonathan P. Dowling  
Proc. AMOS 2001 Technical Conf. Sept. 10-14, Wailea, Maui, Hawaii, P. Kervin, L. Bragg, and S. Ryan, eds. (Maui, 2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202039  
<blockquote>
<p>
The discovery of an algorithm for factoring which runs in polynomial time on a quantum computer has given rise to a concerted effort to understand the principles, advantages, and limitations of quantum computing. At the same time, many different quantum systems are being explored for their suitability to serve as a physical substrate for the quantum computer of the future. I discuss some of the theoretical foundations of quantum computer science, including algorithms and error correction, and present a few physical systems that have shown promise as a quantum computing platform. Finally, we discuss a spin-off of the quantum computing revolution: quantum technologies.

**5.    Linear Optics Quantum Communication over Long Distances**  
Zeng-Bing Chen, Huai-Xin Lu, Yong-De Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202040  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a feasible scheme for teleporting an arbitrary polarization state or entanglement of photons by requiring only single-photon (SP) sources, simple linear optical elements and SP quantum non-demolition measurements. An unknown SP polarization state can be faithfully teleported either to a duplicate polarization state or to an entangled state. Our proposal can be used to implement long-distance quantum communication in a simple way. The scheme is within the reach of current technology and significantly simplifies the realistc implementation of long-distance high-fidelity quantum communication with photon qubits.

**6.    Thermodynamic interpretation of quantum error correcting criterion**  
Vladimir Korepin, John Terilla  
Quantum Information Processing, vol 1, issue 4, pages 225-242, 2002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202054  
<blockquote>
<p>
Shanon's fundamental coding theorems relate classical information theory to thermodynamics. More recent theoretical work has been successful in relating quantum information theory to thermodynamics. For example, Schumacher proved a quantum version of Shannon's 1948 classical noiseless coding theorem. In this note, we extend the connection between quantum information theory and thermodynamics to include quantum error correction. There is a standard mechanism for describing errors that may occur during the transmission, storage, and manipulation of quantum information. One can formulate a criterion of necessary and sufficient conditions for the errors to be detectable and correctable. We show that this criterion has a thermodynamical interpretation.

**7.    Scheme for the generation of an entangled four-photon W-state**  
XuBo Zou, K. Pahlke, W. Mathis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202090  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a scheme to produce an entangled four-photon W-state by using linear optical elements. The symmetrical setup of linear optical elements consists of four beam splitters, four polarization beam splitters and four mirrors. A photon EPR-pair and two single photons are required as the input modes. The projection on the W-state can be made by a four-photon coincidence measurement. Further, we show that by means of a horizontally oriented polarizer in front of one detector the W-state of three photons can be generated.

**8.    Multipartite Classical and Quantum Secrecy Monotones**  
N. J. Cerf, S. Massar, S. Schneider  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 042309 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202103  
<blockquote>
<p>
In order to study multipartite quantum cryptography, we introduce quantities which vanish on product probability distributions, and which can only decrease if the parties carry out local operations or carry out public classical communication. These ``secrecy monotones'' therefore measure how much secret correlations are shared by the parties. In the bipartite case we show that the mutual information is a secrecy monotone. In the multipartite case we describe two different generalisations of the mutual information, both of which are secrecy monotones. The existence of two distinct secrecy monotones allows us to show that in multipartite quantum cryptography the parties must make irreversible choices about which multipartite correlations they want to obtain. Secrecy monotones can be extended to the quantum domain and are then defined on density matrices. We illustrate this generalisation by considering tri-partite quantum cryptography based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We show that before carrying out measurements on the state, the parties must make an irreversible decision about what probability distribution they want to obtain.

**9.    Non-Markovian stochastic Schr?dinger equations: Generalization to real-valued noise using quantum measurement theory**  
Jay Gambetta, H. M. Wiseman  
Phys. Rev. A 66, 012108 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202117  
<blockquote>
<p>
Do stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, also known as unravelings, have a physical interpretation? In the Markovian limit, where the system {\em on average} obeys a master equation, the answer is yes. Markovian stochastic Schr\"odinger equations generate quantum trajectories for the system state conditioned on continuously monitoring the bath. For a given master equation, there are many different unravelings, corresponding to different sorts of measurement on the bath. In this paper we address the non-Markovian case, and in particular the sort of stochastic \sch equation introduced by Strunz, Di\' osi, and Gisin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1801 (1999)]. Using a quantum measurement theory approach, we rederive their unraveling which involves complex-valued Gaussian noise. We also derive an unraveling involving real-valued Gaussian noise. We show that in the Markovian limit, these two unravelings correspond to heterodyne and homodyne detection respectively. Although we use quantum measurement theory to define these unravelings, we conclude that the stochastic evolution of the system state is not a true quantum trajectory, as the identity of the state through time is a fiction.

**10.    High-fidelity quantum logic operations using linear optical elements**  
J.D. Franson, M.M. Donegan, M.J. Fitch, B.C. Jacobs, T.B. Pittman  
Physical Review Letters 89, 137901 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202160  
<blockquote>
<p>
Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn [Nature 409, 46 (2001)] have shown that quantum logic operations can be performed using linear optical elements and additional ancilla photons. Their approach is probabilistic in the sense that the logic devices fail to produce an output with a failure rate that scales as 1/n, where n is the number of ancilla. Here we present an alternative approach in which the logic devices always produce an output with an intrinsic error rate that scales as 1/n^2,which may have several advantages in quantum computing applications.

**11.    Continuous variable teleportation as a generalized thermalizing quantum channel**  
Masashi Ban, Masahide Sasaki, Masahiro Takeoka  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35(28), L401 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202172  
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum channel is derived for continuous variable teleportation which is performed by means of an arbitrary entangled state and the standard protocol. When a Gaussian entangled state such as a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state is used, the continuous variable teleportation is equivalent to the thermalizing quantum channel. Continuous variable dense coding is also considered. Both the continuous variable teleportation and the continuous variable dense coding are characterized by the same function determined by the entangled state and the quantum measurement.

**12.    Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine**  
Masahide Sasaki, Alberto Carlini  
Phys. Rev. A66, 022303 (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0202173  
<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states $\ket f^{\otimes N}$, $\ket{g_1}^{\otimes K}$, and $\ket{g_2}^{\otimes K}$, and we want to decide which \textit{template} state $\ket{g_1}$ or $\ket{g_2}$, each representing the feature of the pattern class ${\cal C}_1$ or ${\cal C}_2$, respectively, is closest to the input \textit{feature} state $\ket f$. This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain. Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The first is a semiclassical strategy which is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure: identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the classifier (\textit{learning} process to train the classifier) and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement which we might call as the {\it universal quantum matching machine}. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure which is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process.
