Davide Iannuzzi, Ian Gelfand, Mariangela Lisanti, Federico Capasso  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312043  
<blockquote>
<p>
This article is divided in three sections. In the first section we briefly review some high precision experiments on the Casimir force, underlying an important aspect of the analysis of the data. In the second section we discuss our recent results in the measurement of the Casimir force using non-trivial materials. In the third section we present some original ideas for experiments on new phenomena related to the Casimir effects.

**3.    Scattering theory and discrete-time quantum walks**  
Edgar Feldman, Mark Hillery  
Physics Letters A 324, 277 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312062  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum walks on general graphs from the point of view of scattering theory. For a general finite graph we choose two vertices and attach one half line to each. We are interested in walks that proceed from one half line, through the graph, to the other. The particle propagates freely on the half lines but is scattered at each vertex in the original graph. The probability of starting on one line and reaching the other after n steps can be expressed in terms of the transmission amplitude for the graph. An example is presented.

**4.    Toward a Quantum Process Algebra**  
Philippe Jorrand, Marie Lalire  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312067  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computations operate in the quantum world. For their results to be useful in any way, there is an intrinsic necessity of cooperation and communication controlled by the classical world. As a consequence, full formal descriptions of algorithms making use of quantum principles must take into account both quantum and classical computing components and assemble them so that they communicate and cooperate. This paper aims at defining a high level language allowing the description of classical and quantum programming, and their cooperation. Since process algebras provide a framework to model cooperating computations and have well defined semantics, they have been chosen as a basis for this language. Starting with a classical process algebra, this paper explains how to transform it for including quantum computation. The result is a quantum process algebra with its operational semantics, which can be used to fully describe quantum algorithms in their classical context.

**5.    Entanglement purification for arbitrary unknown ionic states via linear optics**  
Ming Yang, Wei Song, Zhuo-Liang Cao  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 012308 (2005) (6 pages)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312087  
<blockquote>
<p>
An entanglement purification scheme for arbitrary unknown(mixed and pure non-maximally) entangled ionic states is proposed by using linear optical elements. The main advantage of the scheme is that not only two-ion maximally entangled pairs but also four-ion maximally entangled pairs can be extracted from the less entangled pairs. The scheme is within current technology.

**6.    Convolutionless Non-Markovian master equations and quantum trajectories: Brownian motion revisited**  
Walter T. Strunz, Ting Yu  
Phys. Rev. A 69, 052115 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312103  
<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations for quantum trajectories offer an alternative and sometimes superior approach to the study of open quantum system dynamics. Here we show that recently established convolutionless non-Markovian stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations may serve as a powerful tool for the derivation of convolutionless master equations for non-Markovian open quantum systems. The most interesting example is quantum Brownian motion (QBM) of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a heat bath of oscillators, one of the most-employed exactly soluble models of open system dynamics. We show explicitly how to establish the direct connection between the exact convolutionless master equation of QBM and the corresponding convolutionless exact stochastic Schr\"odinger equation.

**7.    Conditional preparation of single photons for scalable quantum-optical networking**  
Alfred B. U'Ren, Christine Silberhorn, Konrad Banaszek, Ian A. Walmsley  
Physical Review Letters 93 093601 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312118  
<blockquote>
<p>
A fundamental prerequisite for the implementation of linear optical quantum computation is a source of single-photon wavepackets capable of high-visibility interference in scalable networks. These conditions can be met with micro-structured waveguides in conjunction with ultra-short classical timing pulses. By exploiting a novel type-II phasematching configuration we demonstrate a waveguided single photon source exhibiting a conditional detection efficiency exceeding 51% (which corresponds to a preparation efficiency of 85%) and extraordinarily high detection rates of up to 8.5x10^5 coincidences/[s.mW].

**8.    Quantum chaos and random matrix theoryfor fidelity decay in quantum computationswith static imperfections**  
Klaus M. Frahm, Robert Fleckinger, Dima L. Shepelyansky  
European Physical Journal D 29 (2004) 139  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312120  
<blockquote>
<p>
We determine the universal law for fidelity decayin quantum computations of complex dynamics in presenceof internal static imperfections in a quantum computer. Our approach is based on random matrix theory applied toquantum computations in presence of imperfections.The theoretical predictions are tested and confirmed in extensive numerical simulations of a quantum algorithm for quantum chaos in the dynamical tent map with up to 18 qubits. The theory developed determines the time scales forreliable quantum computations in absence of the quantum error correction codes. These time scales are related to the Heisenberg time, the Thouless time, and the decay time given by Fermi's golden rule which are well known in the context of mesoscopic systems. The comparison is presented for static imperfection effects and random errors in quantum gates. A new convenientmethod for the quantum computation of the coarse-grained Wigner function is also proposed.

**9.    Propagating Quantum Walks: the origin of interference structures**  
P.L.Knight, E.Roldan, J.E. Sipe  
J. Mod. Opt. 51 (2004) 1761-1777  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312133  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the solution of the coined quantum walk on a line. First, we derive the full solution, for arbitrary unitary transformations, by using a new approach based on the four "walk fields" which we show determine the dynamics. The particular way of deriving the solution allows a rigorous derivation of a long wavelength approximation. This long wavelength approximation is useful as it provides an approximate analytical expression that captures the basics of the quantum walk and allows us to gain insight into the physics of the process.

**10.    Electron spin detection in the frequency domain under the interrupted Oscillating Cantilever-driven Adiabatic Reversal (iOSCAR) Protocol**  
M. Ting, A. O. Hero, D. Rugar, C. Y. Yip, J. A. Fessler  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312139  
<blockquote>
<p>
Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) is an emergent technology for measuring spin-induced attonewton forces using a micromachined cantilever. In the interrupted Oscillating Cantilever-driven Adiabatic Reversal (iOSCAR) method, small ensembles of electron spins are manipulated by an external radio frequency (RF) magnetic field to produce small periodic deviations in the resonant frequency of the cantilever. These deviations can be detected by frequency demodulation, followed by conventional amplitude or energy detection. In this paper, we develop optimal detectors for several signal models that have been hypothesized for measurements induced by iOSCAR spin manipulation. We show that two simple variants of the energy detector--the filtered energy detector and a hybrid filtered energy/amplitude/energy detector--are approximately asymptotically optimal for the Discrete-Time (D-T) random telegraph signal model assuming White Gaussian Noise (WGN). For the D-T random walk signal model, the filtered energy detector performs close to the optimal Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) when the transition probabilities are symmetric.

**11.    From Linear Optical Quantum Computing to Heisenberg-Limited Interferometry**  
Hwang Lee, Pieter Kok, Colin P. Williams, Jonathan P. Dowling  
J. Opt. B 6, S796 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312169  
<blockquote>
<p>
The working principles of linear optical quantum computing are based on photodetection, namely, projective measurements. The use of photodetection can provide efficient nonlinear interactions between photons at the single-photon level, which is technically problematic otherwise. We report an application of such a technique to prepare quantum correlations as an important resource for Heisenberg-limited optical interferometry, where the sensitivity of phase measurements can be improved beyond the usual shot-noise limit. Furthermore, using such nonlinearities, optical quantum nondemolition measurements can now be carried out at the single-photon level.

**12.    Analysis for practical realization of number-state manipulation by number-sum Bell measurement with linear optics**  
Akira Kitagawa, Katsuji Yamamoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the linear optical realization of number-sum Bell measurement and number-state manipulation by taking into account the realistic experimental situation, specifically imperfectness of single-photon detector. The present scheme for number-state manipulation is based on the number-sum Bell measurement, which is implemented with linear optical elements, i.e., beam splitters, phase shifters and zero-one-photon detectors. Squeezed vacuum states and coherent states are used as optical sources. The linear optical Bell state detector is formulated quantum theoretically with a probability operator measure. Then, the fidelity of manipulation and preparation of number-states, particularly for qubits and qutrits, is evaluated in terms of the quantum efficiency and dark count of single-photon detector. It is found that a high fidelity is achievable with small enough squeezing parameters and coherent state amplitudes.

**13.    Super-resolving phase measurements with a multi-photon entangled state**  
M. W. Mitchell, J. S. Lundeen, A. M. Steinberg  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312186  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using a linear optical elements and post-selection, we construct an entangled polarization state of three photons in the same spatial mode. This state is analogous to a ``photon-number path entangled state'' and can be used for super-resolving interferometry. Measuring a birefringent phase shift, we demonstrate two- and three-fold improvements in phase resolution.

**14.    Scalable Quantum Computation in the Presence of Large Detected-Error Rates**  
E. Knill  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312190  
<blockquote>
<p>
The tolerable erasure error rate for scalable quantum computation is shown to be at least 0.292, given standard scalability assumptions. This bound is obtained by implementing computations with generic stabilizer code teleportation steps that combine the necessary operations with error correction. An interesting consequence of the technique is that the only errors that affect the maximum tolerable error rate are storage and Bell measurement errors. If storage errors are negligible, then any detected Bell measurement error below 1/2 is permissible. Another consequence of the technique is that the maximum tolerable depolarizing error rate is dominated by how well one can prepare the required encoded states. For example, if storage and Bell measurement errors are relatively small, then independent depolarizing errors with error rate close to 0.1 per qubit are tolerable in the prepared states. The implementation overhead is dominated by the efficiency with which the required encoded states can be prepared. At present, this efficiency is very low, particularly for error rates close to the maximum tolerable ones.

**15.    A note on the classical lower bound for a quantum walk algorithm**  
Stephen A. Fenner, Yong Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312230  
<blockquote>
<p>
A recent paper on quantum walks by Childs et al. [STOC'03] provides an example of a black-box problem for which there is a quantum algorithm with exponential speedup over the best classical randomized algorithm for the problem, but where the quantum algorithm does not involve any use of the quantum Fourier transform. They give an exponential lower bound for a classical randomized algorithm solving the black-box graph traversal problem defined in their paper. In this note we give an improved lower bound for this problem via a straightforward and more complete analysis.

**16.    The three-body problem and the Hannay angle**  
A. Spallicci, A. Morbidelli, G. Metris  
Nonlinearity 18 (2005) 45  
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0312551  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Hannay angle has been previously studied for a celestial circular restricted three-body system by means of an adiabatic approach. In the present work, three main results are obtained. Firstly, a formal connection between perturbation theory and the Hamiltonian adiabatic approach shows that both lead to the Hannay angle; it is thus emphasised that this effect is already contained in classical celestial mechanics, although not yet defined nor evaluated separately. Secondly, a more general expression of the Hannay angle, valid for an action-dependent potential is given; such a generalised expression takes into account that the restricted three-body problem is a time-dependent, two degrees of freedom problem even when restricted to the circular motion of the test body. Consequently, (some of) the eccentricity terms cannot be neglected {\it a priori}. Thirdly, we present a new numerical estimate for the Earth adiabatically driven by Jupiter. We also point out errors in a previous derivation of the Hannay angle for the circular restricted three-body problem, with an action-independent potential.

**17.    Exponential splitting of bound states in a waveguide with a pair of distant windows**  
D. Borisov, P. Exner  
Journal of Physics A. 2004. V. 37. No. 10. P. 3411-3428.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0312013  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider Laplacian in a straight planar strip with Dirichlet boundary which has two Neumann ``windows'' of the same length the centers of which are $2l$ apart, and study the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete spectrum as $l\to\infty$. It is shown that there are pairs of eigenvalues around each isolated eigenvalue of a single-window strip and their distances vanish exponentially in the limit $l\to\infty$. We derive an asymptotic expansion also in the case where a single window gives rise to a threshold resonance which the presence of the other window turns into a single isolated eigenvalue.

**18.    Regular quantum graphs**  
Simone Severini, Gregor Tanner  
2004 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37 6675-6686  
http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0312031  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concept of regular quantum graphs and construct connected quantum graphs with discrete symmetries. The method is based on a decomposition of the quantum propagator in terms of permutation matrices which control the way incoming and outgoing channels at vertex scattering processes are connected. Symmetry properties of the quantum graph as well as its spectral statistics depend on the particular choice of permutation matrices, also called connectivity matrices, and can now be easily controlled. The method may find applications in the study of quantum random walks networks and may also prove to be useful in analysing universality in spectral statistics.
