**1.    Entangling capacities of noisy two-qubit Hamiltonians**  
Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay, Daniel A. Lidar  
Phys. Rev. A 70, 010301(R) (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308014  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that intrinsic fluctuations in system control parameters impose limits on the ability of two-qubit (exchange) Hamiltonians to generate entanglement starting from mixed initial states. We find three classes for Gaussian and Laplacian fluctuations. For the Ising and XYZ models there are qualitatively distinct sharp entanglement-generation transitions, while the class of Heisenberg, XY, and XXZ Hamiltonians is capable of generating entanglement for any finite noise level. Our findings imply that exchange Hamiltonians are surprisingly robust in their ability to generate entanglement in the presence of noise, thus potentially reducing the need for quantum error correction.

**2.    High Efficiency Photon Number Detection for Quantum Information Processing**  
Edo Waks, Kyo Inoue, Eleni Diamanti, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308054  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Visible Light Photon Counter (VLPC) features high quantum efficiency and low pulse height dispersion. These properties make it ideal for efficient photon number state detection. The ability to perform efficient photon number state detection is important in many quantum information processing applications, including recent proposals for performing quantum computation with linear optical elements. In this paper we investigate the unique capabilities of the VLPC. The efficiency of the detector and cryogenic system is measured at 543nm wavelengths to be 85%. A picosecond pulsed laser is then used to excite the detector with pulses having average photon numbers ranging from 3-5. The output of the VLPC is used to discriminate photon numbers in a pulse. The error probability for number state discrimination is an increasing function of the number of photons, due to buildup of multiplication noise. This puts an ultimate limit on the ability of the VLPC to do number state detection. For many applications, it is sufficient to discriminate between 1 and more than one detected photon. The VLPC can do this with 99% accuracy.

**3.    Probing the dispersive and spatial properties of planar photonic crystal waveguide modes via highly efficient coupling from optical fiber tapers**  
Paul E. Barclay, Kartik Srinivasan, Matthew Borselli, Oskar Painter  
Appl. Phys. Lett., v85, 4 (2004).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308070  
<blockquote>
<p>
The demonstration of an optical fiber based probe for efficiently exciting the waveguide modes of high-index contrast planar photonic crystal (PC) slabs is presented. Utilizing the dispersion of the PC, fiber taper waveguides formed from standard silica single-mode optical fibers are used to evanescently couple light into the guided modes of a patterned silicon membrane. A coupling efficiency of approximately 95% is obtained between the fiber taper and a PC waveguide mode suitably designed for integration with a previously studied ultra-small mode volume high-Q PC resonant cavity [1]. The micron-scale lateral extent and dispersion of the fiber taper is also used as a near-field spatial and spectral probe to study the profile and dispersion of PC waveguide modes. The mode selectivity of this wafer-scale probing technique, together with its high efficiency, suggests that it will be useful in future quantum and non-linear optics experiments employing planar PCs.

**4.    A note on graphs resistant to quantum uniform mixing**  
William Adamczak, Kevin Andrew, Peter Hernberg, Christino Tamon  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308073  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous-time quantum walks on graphs is a generalization of continuous-time Markov chains on discrete structures. Moore and Russell proved that the continuous-time quantum walk on the $n$-cube is instantaneous exactly uniform mixing but has no average mixing property. On complete (circulant) graphs $K_{n}$, the continuous-time quantum walk is neither instantaneous (except for $n=2,3,4$) nor average uniform mixing (except for $n=2$). We explore two natural {\em group-theoretic} generalizations of the $n$-cube as a $G$-circulant and as a bunkbed $G \rtimes \Int_{2}$, where $G$ is a finite group. Analyses of these classes suggest that the $n$-cube might be special in having instantaneous uniform mixing and that non-uniform average mixing is pervasive, i.e., no memoryless property for the average limiting distribution; an implication of these graphs having zero spectral gap. But on the bunkbeds, we note a memoryless property with respect to the two partitions. We also analyze average mixing on complete paths, where the spectral gaps are nonzero.

**5.    Controlled Collisions for Multiparticle Entanglement of Optically Trapped Atoms**  
Olaf Mandel, Markus Greiner, Artur Widera, Tim Rom, Theodor W. Haensch, Immanuel Bloch  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308080  
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and in recent years has been identified as an essential resource for quantum information processing and computation. Creating highly entangled multi-particle states is therefore one of the most challenging goals of modern experimental quantum mechanics, touching fundamental questions as well as practical applications. Here we report on the experimental realization of controlled collisions between individual neighbouring neutral atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an optical lattice. These controlled interactions act as an array of quantum gates between neighbouring atoms in the lattice and their massively parallel operation allows the creation of highly entangled states in a single operational step, independent of the size of the system. In the experiment, we observe a coherent entangling-disentangling evolution in the many-body system depending on the phase shift acquired during the collision between neighbouring atoms. This dynamics is indicative of highly entangled many-body states that present novel opportunities for theory and experiment.

**6.    Quantum arrival times and operator normalization**  
G.C. Hegerfeldt, D. Seidel, J.G. Muga  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 022111 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308087  
<blockquote>
<p>
A recent approach to arrival times used the fluorescence of an atom entering a laser illuminated region and the resulting arrival-time distribution was close to the axiomatic distribution of Kijowski, but not exactly equal, neither in limiting cases nor after compensation of reflection losses by normalization on the level of expectation values. In this paper we employ a normalization on the level of operators, recently proposed in a slightly different context. We show that in this case the axiomatic arrival time distribution of Kijowski is recovered as a limiting case. In addition, it is shown that Allcock's complex potential model is also a limit of the physically motivated fluorescence approach and connected to Kijowski's distribution through operator normalization.

**7.    Phase-space approach to the study of decoherence in quantum walks**  
C. C. Lopez, J. P. Paz  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 052305 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308104  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the quantum walk on a cycle using discrete Wigner functions as a way to represent the states and the evolution of the walker. The method provides some insight on the nature of the interference effects that make quantum and classical walks different. We also study the behavior of the system when the quantum coin carried by the walker interacts with an environment. We show that for this system quantum coherence is robust for initially delocalized states of the walker. The use of phase-space representation enables us to develop an intuitive description of the nature of the decoherence process in this system.

**9.    Experimental nonlinear sign shift for linear optics quantum computation**  
Kaoru Sanaka, Thomas Jennewein, Jian-Wei Pan, Kevin Resch, Anton Zeilinger  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 017902 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308134  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have realized the nonlinear sign shift (NS) operation for photonic qubits.This operation shifts the phase of two photons reflected by a beam splitter using an extra single photon and measurement. We show that the conditional phase shift is $(1.05\pm 0.06) \pi $ in clear agreement with theory. Our results show that by using an ancilla photon and conditional detection, nonlinear optical effects can be implemented using only linear optical elements. This experiment represents an essential step for linear optical implementations of scalable quantum computation.

**10.    Compensation of decoherence from telegraph noise by means of bang-bang control**  
H. Gutmann, F.K. Wilhelm, W.M. Kaminsky, S. Lloyd  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0308107  
<blockquote>
<p>
With the growing efforts in isolating solid-state qubits from external decoherence sources, the origins of noise inherent to the material start to play a relevant role. One representative example are charged impurities in the device material or substrate, which typically produce telegraph noise and can hence be modelled as bistable fluctuators. In order to demonstrate the possibility of the active suppression of the disturbance from a {\em single} fluctuator, we theoretically implement an elementary bang-bang control protocol. We numerically simulate the random walk of the qubit state on the Bloch sphere with and without bang-bang compensation by means of the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation and compare it with an analytical saddle point solution of the corresponding Langevin equation in the long-time limit. We find that the deviation with respect to the noiseless case is significantly reduced when bang-bang pulses are applied, being scaled down approximately by the ratio of the bang-bang period and the typical flipping time of the bistable fluctuation. Our analysis gives not only the effect of bang-bang control on the variance of these deviations, but also their entire distribution. As a result, we expect that bang-bang control works as a high-pass filter on the spectrum of noise sources. This indicates how the influence of $1/f$-noise ubiquitous to the solid state world can be reduced.
