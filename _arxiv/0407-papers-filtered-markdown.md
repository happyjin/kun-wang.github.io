**1.    Frequency and temporal effects in linear optical quantum computing**  
Peter P. Rohde, Timothy C. Ralph  
Phys. Rev. A, 71, 032320 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407002  
<blockquote>
<p>
Typically linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) models assume that all input photons are completely indistinguishable. In practice there will inevitably be non-idealities associated with the photons and the experimental setup which will introduce a degree of distinguishability between photons. We consider a non-deterministic optical controlled-NOT gate, a fundamental LOQC gate, and examine the effect of temporal and spectral distinguishability on its operation. We also consider the effect of utilizing non-ideal photon counters, which have finite bandwidth and time response.

**2.    Classically-Controlled Quantum Computation**  
Simon Perdrix, Philippe Jorrand  
Math. Struct. in Comp. Science, 16:601-620, 2006  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407008  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computations usually take place under the control of the classical world. We introduce a Classically-controlled Quantum Turing Machine (CQTM) which is a Turing Machine (TM) with a quantum tape for acting on quantum data, and a classical transition function for a formalized classical control. In CQTM, unitary transformations and measurements are allowed. We show that any classical TM is simulated by a CQTM without loss of efficiency. The gap between classical and quantum computations, already pointed out in the framework of measurement-based quantum computation is confirmed. To appreciate the similarity of programming classical TM and CQTM, examples are given.

**3.    Breakdown of an Electric-Field Driven System: a Mapping to a Quantum Walk**  
Takashi Oka, Norio Konno, Ryotaro Arita, Hideo Aoki  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 100602 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407013  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum transport properties of electron systems driven by strong electric fields are studied by mapping the Landau-Zener transition dynamics to a quantum walk on a semi-infinite one-dimensional lattice with a reflecting boundary, where the sites correspond to energy levels and the boundary the ground state. Quantum interference induces a distribution localized around the ground state, and when the electric field is strengthened, a delocalization transition occurs describing breakdown of the original electron system.

**4.    Error Filtration and Entanglement Purification for Quantum Communication**  
N. Gisin, N. Linden, S. Massar, S. Popescu  
Phys. Rev. A 72, 012338 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407021  
<blockquote>
<p>
The key realisation which lead to the emergence of the new field of quantum information processing is that quantum mechanics, the theory that describes microscopic particles, allows the processing of information in fundamentally new ways. But just as in classical information processing, errors occur in quantum information processing, and these have to be corrected. A fundamental breakthrough was the realisation that quantum error correction is in fact possible. However most work so far has not been concerned with technological feasibility, but rather with proving that quantum error correction is possible in principle. Here we describe a method for filtering out errors and entanglement purification which is particularly suitable for quantum communication. Our method is conceptually new, and, crucially, it is easy to implement in a wide variety of physical systems with present day technology and should therefore be of wide applicability.

**5.    On the Key-Uncertainty of Quantum Ciphers and the Computational Security of One-way Quantum Transmission**  
Ivan Damgaard, Thomas Pedersen, Louis Salvail  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407066  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the scenario where Alice wants to send a secret (classical) $n$-bit message to Bob using a classical key, and where only one-way transmission from Alice to Bob is possible. In this case, quantum communication cannot help to obtain perfect secrecy with key length smaller then $n$. We study the question of whether there might still be fundamental differences between the case where quantum as opposed to classical communication is used. In this direction, we show that there exist ciphers with perfect security producing quantum ciphertext where, even if an adversary knows the plaintext and applies an optimal measurement on the ciphertext, his Shannon uncertainty about the key used is almost maximal. This is in contrast to the classical case where the adversary always learns $n$ bits of information on the key in a known plaintext attack. We also show that there is a limit to how different the classical and quantum cases can be: the most probable key, given matching plain- and ciphertexts, has the same probability in both the quantum and the classical cases. We suggest an application of our results in the case where only a short secret key is available and the message is much longer.

**6.    Implementing Grover's Quantum Search on a Para-Hydrogen based Pure State NMR Quantum Computer**  
M. S. Anwar, D. Blazina, H. Carteret, S. B. Duckett, J. A. Jones  
Chem. Phys. Lett. 400, 94-97 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407091  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the implementation of Grover's quantum search algorithm on a liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer using essentially pure states. This was achieved using a two qubit device where the initial state is an essentially pure ($\epsilon=1.06\pm0.04$) singlet nuclear spin state of a pair of 1H nuclei arising from a chemical reaction involving para-hydrogen. We have implemented Grover's search to find one of four inputs which satisfies a function.

**7.    Quantum Networks for Generating Arbitrary Quantum States**  
Phillip Kaye, Michele Mosca  
Phillip Kaye, Michele Mosca, "Quantum Networks for Generating Arbitrary Quantum States", Proceedings, International Conference on Quantum Information (ICQI). Rochester, New York, USA, 2001  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407102  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum protocols often require the generation of specific quantum states. We describe a quantum algorithm for generating any prescribed quantum state. For an important subclass of states, including pure symmetric states, this algorithm is efficient.

**8.    Atom waveguide using a two-color evanescent light field around a subwavelength-diameter optical fiber**  
Fam Le Kien, V. I. Balykin, K. Hakuta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407107  
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest using a two-color evanescent light field around a subwavelength-diameter fiber to trap and guide atoms. The optical fiber carries a red-detuned light and a blue-detuned light, with both modes far from resonance. When both input light fields are circularly polarized, a set of trapping minima of the total potential in the transverse plane is formed as a ring around the fiber. This design allows confinement of atoms to a cylindrical shell around the fiber. When one or both of the input light fields are linearly polarized, the total potential has two local minimum points in the transverse plane. This design allows confinement of atoms to two straight lines parallel to the fiber axis. Due to the thin thickness of the fiber, we can use far-off-resonance fields with substantially differing evanescent decay lengths to produce a net potential with a large depth, a large coherence time, and a large trap lifetime. For example, a 0.2-$\mu$m-radius silica fiber carrying 30 mW of 1.06-$\mu$m-wavelength light and 29 mW of 700-nm-wavelength light, both fields are circularly polarized at the input, gives for cesium atoms a trap depth of 2.9 mK, a coherence time of 32 ms, and a recoil-heating-limited trap lifetime of 541 s.

**9.    Quasiperiodic dynamics of coherent diffusion: a quantum walk approach**  
A.Wojcik, T.Luczak, P.Kurzynski, A.Grudka, M.Bednarska  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407128  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of a generalization of quantum coin walk on the line which is a natural model for a diffusion modified by quantum or interference effects. In particular, our results provide surprisingly simple explanations to phenomena observed by Bouwmeester et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 61, 13410 (1999)) in their optical Galton board experiment, and a description of a stroboscopic quantum walks given by Buershaper and Burnett (quant-ph/0406039) through numerical simulations. We also provide heuristic explanations for the behavior of our model which show, in particular, that its dynamics can be viewed as a discrete version of Bloch oscillations.

**10.    Towards a quantum evolutionary scheme: violating Bell's inequalities in language**  
Diederik Aerts, Marek Czachor, Bart D'Hooghe  
In N. Gontier, J. P. Van Bendegem and D. Aerts (Eds.), Evolutionary Epistemology, Language and Culture. Dordrecht: Springer (2005).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407150  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show the presence of genuine quantum structures in human language. The neo-Darwinian evolutionary scheme is founded on a probability structure that satisfies the Kolmogorovian axioms, and as a consequence cannot incorporate quantum-like evolutionary change. In earlier research we revealed quantum structures in processes taking place in conceptual space. We argue that the presence of quantum structures in language and the earlier detected quantum structures in conceptual change make the neo-Darwinian evolutionary scheme strictly too limited for Evolutionary Epistemology. We sketch how we believe that evolution in a more general way should be implemented in epistemology and conceptual change, but also in biology, and how this view would lead to another relation between both biology and epistemology.

**11.    On the control of the lateral Casimir force between corrugated surfaces**  
E. V. Blagov, G. L. Klimchitskaya, U. Mohideen, V. M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. A, v.69, N4, p.044103-(1-4), 2004  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407157  
<blockquote>
<p>
The general perturbative expression for the lateral Casimir force between two plates covered by longitudinal corrugations of arbitrary shape is obtained. This expression is applicable for corrugation periods larger than the separation distance. The cases of asymmetric corrugations are considered, which allow to increase the maximum to minimum force ratio and affect the character of equilibrium points. This opens new opportunities to control the lateral Casimir forces for use in microelectromechanical devices based entirely on the vacuum fluctuation properties.

**12.    Realization of Universal Optimal Quantum Machines by Projective Operators and Stochastic Maps**  
F. Sciarrino, C. Sias, M. Ricci, F. De Martini  
Phys. Rev. A 70, 052305 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407176  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optimal quantum machines can be implemented by linear projective operations. In the present work a general qubit symmetrization theory is presented by investigating the close links to the qubit purification process and to the programmable teleportation of any generic optimal anti-unitary map. In addition, the contextual realization of the N ->M cloning map and of the teleportation of the N->(M-N) universal NOT gate is analyzed by a novel and very general angular momentum theory. An extended set of experimental realizations by state symmetrization linear optical procedures is reported. These include the 1->2 cloning process, the UNOT gate and the quantum tomographic characterization of the optimal partial transpose map of polarization encoded qubits.

**13.    Loophole-free test of quantum non-locality using high-efficiency homodyne detectors**  
R. Garcia-Patron, J. Fiurasek, N.J. Cerf  
Phys. Rev. A 71, 022105 (2005).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407181  
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a detailed analysis of the recently proposed setup for a loophole-free test of Bell inequality using conditionally generated non-Gaussian states of light and balanced homodyning. In the proposed scheme, a two-mode squeezed vacuum state is de-gaussified by subtracting a single photon from each mode with the use of an unbalanced beam splitter and a standard low-efficiency single-photon detector. We thoroughly discuss the dependence of the achievable Bell violation on the various relevant experimental parameters such as the detector efficiencies, the electronic noise and the mixedness of the initial Gaussian state. We also consider several alternative schemes involving squeezed states, linear optical elements, conditional photon subtraction and homodyne detection.

**14.    The language of Einstein spoken by optical instruments**  
Sibel Baskal, Y. S. Kim  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407222  
<blockquote>
<p>
Einstein had to learn the mathematics of Lorentz transformations in order to complete his covariant formulation of Maxwell's equations. The mathematics of Lorentz transformations, called the Lorentz group, continues playing its important role in optical sciences. It is the basic mathematical language for coherent and squeezed states. It is noted that the six-parameter Lorentz group can be represented by two-by-two matrices. Since the beam transfer matrices in ray optics is largely based on two-by-two matrices or $ABCD$ matrices, the Lorentz group is bound to be the basic language for ray optics, including polarization optics, interferometers, lens optics, multilayer optics, and the Poincar\'e sphere. Because the group of Lorentz transformations and ray optics are based on the same two-by-two matrix formalism, ray optics can perform mathematical operations which correspond to transformations in special relativity. It is shown, in particular, that one-lens optics provides a mathematical basis for unifying the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles in the Lorentz-covariant world.

**15.    Single-atom detection using whispering gallery modes of microdisk resonators**  
Michael Rosenblit, Peter Horak, Steve Helsby, Ron Folman  
Phys. Rev. A 70, 053808 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407229  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the possibility of using dielectric microdisk resonators for the optical detection of single atoms trapped and cooled in magnetic microtraps near the surface of a substrate. The bound and evanescent fields of optical whispering gallery modes are calculated and the coupling to straight waveguides is investigated using finite-difference time domain solutions of Maxwell's equations. Results are compared with semi-analytical solutions based on coupled mode theory. We discuss atom detection efficiencies and the feasibility of non-destructive measurements in such a system depending on key parameters such as disk size, disk-waveguide coupling, and scattering losses.

**16.    Deciding separability with a fixed error**  
David Perez-Garcia  
Phys. Lett. A 330 (2004) 149-154.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407247  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a short proof of the cross norm characterization of separability due to O. Rudolph and show how its computation, for a fixed chosen error, can be reduced to a linear programming problem whose dimension grows polynomially with the inverse of the error.

**17.    Relativistic quantum communication with bosonic and fermionic interferometers**  
Pieter Kok, Samuel L. Braunstein  
Int.J.Quant.Inf. 4 (2006) 119  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407259  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive the relativistic transformation laws for the annihilation operators of the scalar field, the massive spin-1 vector field, the electromagnetic field and the spinor field. The technique developed here involves straightforward mathematical techniques based on fundamental quantum field theory, and is applicable to the study of entanglement in arbitrary coordinate transformations. In particular, it predicts particle creation for non-inertial motion. Furthermore, we present a unified description of relativistic transformations and multi-particle interferometry with bosons and fermions, which encompasses linear optical quantum computing.

**18.    Quantum error correction of coherent errors by randomization**  
O.Kern, G.Alber, D.L.Shepelyansky  
Eur. Phys. J. D 32, 153 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407262  
<blockquote>
<p>
A general error correction method is presented which is capable of correcting coherent errors originating from static residual inter-qubit couplings in a quantum computer. It is based on a randomization of static imperfections in a many-qubit system by the repeated application of Pauli operators which change the computational basis. This Pauli-Random-Error-Correction (PAREC)-method eliminates coherent errors produced by static imperfections and increases significantly the maximum time over which realistic quantum computations can be performed reliably. Furthermore, it does not require redundancy so that all physical qubits involved can be used for logical purposes.

**19.    Effects of decoherence and imperfections for quantum algorithms**  
A.A. Pomeransky, O.V. Zhirov, D.L. Shepelyansky  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407264  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study effects of static inter-qubit interactions and random errors in quantum gates on the stability of various quantum algorithms including the Grover quantum search algorithm and the quantum chaos maps. For the Grover algorithm our numerical and analytical results show existence of regular and chaotic phases depending on the static imperfection strength $\epsilon$. The critical border $\epsilon_c$ between two phases drops polynomially with the number of qubits $n_q$ as $\epsilon_c \sim n_q^{-3/2}$. In the regular phase $(\epsilon < \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm remains robust against imperfections showing the efficiency gain $\epsilon_c / \epsilon$ for $\epsilon > 2^{-n_q/2}$. In the chaotic phase $(\epsilon > \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm is completely destroyed. The results for the Grover algorithm are compared with the imperfection effects for quantum algorithms of quantum chaos maps where the universal law for the fidelity decay is given by the Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We also discuss a new gyroscopic quantum error correction method which allows to reduce the effect of static imperfections. In spite of this decay GYQEC allows to obtain a significant gain in the accuracy of quantum computations.
