**1.    Solving the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation with absorbing boundary conditions and source terms in Mathematica 6.0**  
F. L. Dubeibe  
International Journal of Modern Physics C (IJMPC) 21 (11), 1391 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0044  
<blockquote>
<p>
In recent decades a lot of research has been done on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. On the one hand, some of the proposed numerical methods do not need any kind of matrix inversion, but source terms cannot be easily implemented into this schemes; on the other, some methods involving matrix inversion can implement source terms in a natural way, but are not easy to implement into some computational software programs widely used by non-experts in programming (e.g. Mathematica). We present a simple method to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by using a standard Crank-Nicholson method together with a Cayley's form for the finite-difference representation of evolution operator. Here, such standard numerical scheme has been simplified by inverting analytically the matrix of the evolution operator in position representation. The analytical inversion of the N x N matrix let us easily and fully implement the numerical method, with or without source terms, into Mathematica or even into any numerical computing language or computational software used for scientific computing.

**2.    Quantumness in decoherent quantum walk using measurement-induced disturbance**  
R. Srikanth, Subhashish Banerjee, C. M. Chandrashekar  
Phys. Rev. A, 81, 062123 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0183  
<blockquote>
<p>
The classicalization of a decoherent discrete-time quantum walk on a line or an n-cycle can be demonstrated in various ways that do not necessarily provide a geometry-independent description. For example, the position probability distribution becomes increasingly Gaussian, with a concomitant fall in the standard deviation, in the former case, but not in the latter. As another example, each step of the quantum walk on a line may be subjected to an arbitrary phase gate, without affecting the position probability distribution, no matter whether the walk is noiseless or noisy. This symmetry, which is absent in the case of noiseless cyclic walk, but is restored in the presence of sufficient noise, serves as an indicator of classicalization, but only in the cyclic case. Here we show that the degree of quantum correlations between the coin and position degrees of freedom, quantified by a measure based on the disturbance induced by local measurements (Luo, Phys. Rev. A 77, 022301 (2008)), provides a suitable measure of classicalization across both type of walks. Applying this measure to compare the two walks, we find that cyclic quantum walks tend to classicalize faster than quantum walks on a line because of more efficient phase randomization due to the self-interference of the two counter-rotating waves. We model noise as acting on the coin, and given by the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, which generalizes the generalized amplitude damping channel.

**3.    Non-Markovian stochastic description of quantum transport in photosynthetic systems**  
Ines de Vega  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0465  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze several aspects of the transport dynamics in the LH1-RC core of purple bacteria, which consists basically in a ring of antenna molecules that transport the energy into a target molecule, the reaction center, placed in the center of the ring. We show that the periodicity of the system plays an important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport efficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any initial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last situation by using stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and non-Markovian type of interactions.

**4.    Recurrences in three-state quantum walks on a plane**  
B. Kollár, M. ?tefaňák, T. Kiss, I. Jex  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 012303 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0688  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the role of dimensionality in the time evolution of discrete time quantum walks through the example of the three-state walk on a two-dimensional, triangular lattice. We show that the three-state Grover walk does not lead to trapping (localization) or recurrence to the origin, in sharp contrast to the Grover walk on the two dimensional square lattice. We determine the power law scaling of the probability at the origin with the method of stationary phase. We prove that only a special subclass of coin operators can lead to recurrence and there are no coins leading to localization. The propagation for the recurrent subclass of coins is quasi one-dimensional.

**5.    Exact non-Markovian cavity dynamics strongly coupled to a reservoir**  
Heng-Na Xiong, Wei-Min Zhang, Xiaoguang Wang, Meng-Hsiu Wu  
Phys. Rev. A82, 012105 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0904  
<blockquote>
<p>
The exact non-Markovian dynamics of a microcavity strongly coupled to a general reservoir at arbitrary temperature is studied. With the exact master equation for the reduced density operator of the cavity system, we analytically solve the time evolution of the cavity state and the associated physical observables. We show that the non-Markovian dynamics is completely determined by the propagating (retarded) and correlation Green functions. Compare the non-Markovian behavior at finite temperature with those at zero-temperature limit or Born-Markov limit, we find that the non-Markovian memory effect can dramatically change the coherent and thermal dynamics of the cavity. We also numerically study the dissipation dynamics of the cavity through the mean mode amplitude decay and the average photon number decay in the microwave regime. It is shown that the strong coupling between the cavity and the reservoir results in a long-time dissipationless evolution to the cavity field amplitude, and its noise dynamics undergoes a critical transition from the weak to strong coupling due to the non-Markovian memory effect.

**6.    Non-classical correlations in non-Markovian continuous variable systems**  
R. Vasile, P. Giorda, S. Olivares, M. G. A. Paris, S. Maniscalco  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 012313 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1043  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider two identical and non-interacting harmonic oscillators coupled to either two independent bosonic baths or to a common bosonic bath. Under the only assumption of weak coupling, we analyze in details the non-Markovian short time-scale evolution of intensity correlations, entanglement and quantum discord for initial two-mode squeezed-thermal vacuum states. In the independent reservoirs case we observe the detrimental effect of the environment for all these quantities and we establish a hierarchy for their robustness against the environmental noise. In the common reservoir case, for initial uncorrelated states, we find that only quantum discord can be created via interaction with the bath, while entanglement and sub shot noise intensity correlations remain absent.

**7.    Linear optical quantum computation with imperfect entangled photon-pair sources and inefficient non-photon-number-resolving detectors**  
Yan-Xiao Gong, Xu-Bo Zou, Timothy C. Ralph, Shi-Ning Zhu, Guang-Can Guo

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1126  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for efficient cluster state quantum computation by using imperfect polarization-entangled photon-pair sources, linear optical elements and inefficient non-photon-number-resolving detectors. The efficiency threshold for loss tolerance in our scheme requires the product of source and detector efficiencies should be >1/2 - the best known figure. This figure applies to uncorrelated loss. We further find that the loss threshold is unaffected by correlated loss in the photon pair source. Our approach sheds new light on efficient linear optical quantum computation with imperfect experimental conditions.

**8.    Classical simulation of commuting quantum computations implies collapse of the polynomial hierarchy**  
Michael J. Bremner, Richard Jozsa, Dan J. Shepherd  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1407  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as IQP computations, and provide compelling evidence that the task of sampling their output probability distributions is unlikely to be achievable by any efficient classical means. More specifically we introduce the class post-IQP of languages decided with bounded error by uniform families of IQP circuits with post-selection, and prove first that post-IQP equals the classical class PP. Using this result we show that if the output distributions of uniform IQP circuit families could be classically efficiently sampled, even up to 41% multiplicative error in the probabilities, then the infinite tower of classical complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy, would collapse to its third level. We mention some further results on the classical simulation properties of IQP circuit families, in particular showing that if the output distribution results from measurements on only O(log n) lines then it may in fact be classically efficiently sampled.

**9.    Nakajima-Zwanzig versus time-convolutionless master equation for the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level system**  
Andrea Smirne, Bassano Vacchini  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 022110 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1604  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the exact reduced dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic reservoir, further obtaining the exact time-convolutionless and Nakajima-Zwanzig non-Markovian equations of motion. The considered system includes the damped and undamped Jaynes-Cummings model. The result is obtained by exploiting an expression of quantum maps in terms of matrices and a simple relation between the time evolution map and time-convolutionless generator as well as Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel. This non-perturbative treatment shows that each operator contribution in Lindblad form appearing in the exact time-convolutionless master equation is multiplied by a different time dependent function. Similarly, in the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation each such contribution is convoluted with a different memory kernel. It appears that depending on the state of the environment the operator structures of the two set of equations of motion can exhibit important differences.

**10.    Directly estimating non-classicality**  
A. Mari, K. Kieling, B. Melholt Nielsen, E. S. Polzik, J. Eisert  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 010403 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1665  
<blockquote>
<p>
We establish a method of directly measuring and estimating non-classicality - operationally defined in terms of the distinguishability of a given state from one with a positive Wigner function. It allows to certify non-classicality, based on possibly much fewer measurement settings than necessary for obtaining complete tomographic knowledge, and is at the same time equipped with a full certificate. We find that even from measuring two conjugate variables alone, one may infer the non-classicality of quantum mechanical modes. This method also provides a practical tool to eventually certify such features in mechanical degrees of freedom in opto-mechanics. The proof of the result is based on Bochner's theorem characterizing classical and quantum characteristic functions and on semi-definite programming. In this joint theoretical-experimental work we present data from experimental optical Fock state preparation, demonstrating the functioning of the approach.

**11.    Enhanced and reduced atom number fluctuations in a BEC splitter**  
Kenneth Maussang, G. Edward Marti, Tobias Schneider, Philipp Treutlein, Yun Li, Alice Sinatra, Romain Long, Jér?me Estève, Jakob Reichel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1922  
<blockquote>
<p>
We measure atom number statistics after splitting a gas of ultracold 87Rb atoms in a purely magnetic double-well potential created on an atom chip. Well below the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation T_c, we observe reduced fluctuations down to -4.9dB below the atom shot noise level. Fluctuations rise to more than +3.8dB close to T_c, before reaching the shot noise level for higher temperatures. We use two-mode and classical field simulations to model these results. This allows us to confirm that the super-shot noise fluctuations directly originate from quantum statistics.

**12.    Public Quantum Communication and Superactivation**  
Fernando G.S.L. Brand?o, Jonathan Oppenheim  
IEEE Trans. Info. Theo. 59, 2517 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1975  
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there a meaningful quantum counterpart to public communication? We argue that the symmetric-side channel -- which distributes quantum information symmetrically between the receiver and the environment -- is a good candidate for a notion of public quantum communication in entanglement distillation and quantum error correction. This connection is partially motivated by [Brand\~ao and Oppenheim, arXiv:1004.3328], where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate a secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a shared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever used to simulate a symmetric-side channel, and can always be replaced by it without altering the optimal rate. Here we further show, in complete analogy to the role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side channel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently-introduced mutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the extent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification. Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been recently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum channel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this non-additivity of the channel capacity and its relation to quantum privacy. In particular, we show that single-copy superactivation protocols with the erasure channel, which encompasses all examples of non-additivity of the quantum capacity found to date, can be understood as a conversion of mutual independence into distillable entanglement.

**13.    Multi-Atomic Mirror for Perfect Reflection of Single Photons in A Wide Band of Frequency**  
Yue Chang, Z. R. Gong, C. P. Sun  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2274  
<blockquote>
<p>
A resonant two level atom doped in one dimensional waveguide behaves as a mirror, but this single-atom "mirror" can only reflect single photon perfectly at a specific frequency. For a one dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide, we propose to extend the perfect reflection region from a specific frequency to a wide band by placing many atoms individually in the resonators in a finite coordinate region of the waveguide. Such a doped resonator array promises us to control the propagation of a practical photon wave packet with certain momentum distribution instead of a single photon, which is ideally represented by a plane wave with specific momentum. The studies based on the discrete-coordinate scattering theory display that such hybrid structure indeed provides a near-perfect reflection for single photon in a wide band. We also calculated photon group velocity distribution, which shows that the perfect reflection with wide band exactly corresponds to the stopping light region.

**14.    The $χ^2$ - divergence and Mixing times of quantum Markov processes**  
K. Temme, M. J. Kastoryano, M. B. Ruskai, M. M. Wolf, F. Verstraete  
J. Math. Phys. 51, 122201 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2358  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce quantum versions of the $\chi^2$-divergence, provide a detailed analysis of their properties, and apply them in the investigation of mixing times of quantum Markov processes. An approach similar to the one presented in [1-3] for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum Markov processes. Furthermore the contractive behavior of the $\chi^2$-divergence under the action of a completely positive map is investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm. In this context we analyse different versions of quantum detailed balance and, finally, give a geometric conductance bound to the convergence rate for unital quantum Markov processes.

**15.    Quantum Stabilizer Codes for Correlated and Asymmetric Depolarizing Errors**  
Carlo Cafaro, Stefano Mancini  
Phys. Rev. A82, 012306 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3374  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the performance of common quantum stabilizer codes in the presence of asymmetric and correlated errors. Specifically, we consider the depolarizing noisy quantum memory channel and perform quantum error correction via the five and seven-qubit stabilizer codes. We characterize these codes by means of the entanglement fidelity as function of the error probability and the degree of memory. We show that their performances are lowered by the presence of correlations and we compute the error probability threshold values for codes effectiveness. Furthermore, we uncover that the asymmetry in the error probabilities does not affect the performance of the five-qubit code while it does affect the performance of the seven-qubit code which results less effective when considering correlated and symmetric depolarizing errors but more effective for correlated and asymmetric errors.

**16.    Single-shot qubit readout in circuit Quantum Electrodynamics**  
Fran?ois Mallet, Florian R. Ong, Agustin Palacios-Laloy, Fran?ois Nguyen, Patrice Bertet, Denis Vion, Daniel Esteve  
Nature Physics 5, 791-795 (27 September 2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3436  
<blockquote>
<p>
The future development of quantum information using superconducting circuits requires Josephson qubits [1] with long coherence times combined to a high-fidelity readout. Major progress in the control of coherence has recently been achieved using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures [2, 3], where the qubit is embedded in a coplanar waveguide resonator (CPWR) which both provides a well controlled electromagnetic environment and serves as qubit readout. In particular a new qubit design, the transmon, yields reproducibly long coherence times [4, 5]. However, a high-fidelity single-shot readout of the transmon, highly desirable for running simple quantum algorithms or measur- ing quantum correlations in multi-qubit experiments, is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate a new transmon circuit where the CPWR is turned into a sample-and-hold detector, namely a Josephson Bifurcation Amplifer (JBA) [6, 7], which allows both fast measurement and single-shot discrimination of the qubit states. We report Rabi oscillations with a high visibility of 94% together with dephasing and relaxation times longer than 0:5 \mu\s. By performing two subsequent measurements, we also demonstrate that this new readout does not induce extra qubit relaxation.

**17.    Degree of separability of bipartite quantum states**  
Guo Chuan Thiang  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 012332 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3675  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the problem of finding the optimal convex decomposition of a bipartite quantum state into a separable part and a positive remainder, in which the weight of the separable part is maximal. This weight is naturally identified with the degree of separability of the state. In a recent work, the problem was solved for two-qubit states using semidefinite programming. In this paper, we describe a procedure to obtain the optimal decomposition of a bipartite state of any finite dimension via a sequence of semidefinite relaxations. The sequence of decompositions thus obtained is shown to converge to the optimal one. This provides, for the first time, a systematic method to determine the so-called optimal Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition of any bipartite state. Numerical results are provided to illustrate this procedure, and the special case of rank-2 states is also discussed.

Birgit Hein, Gregor Tanner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3676  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum algorithms for searching one or more marked items on a d-dimensional lattice provide an extension of Grover's search algorithm including a spatial component. We demonstrate that these lattice search algorithms can be viewed in terms of the level dynamics near an avoided crossing of a one-parameter family of quantum random walks. We give approximations for both the level-splitting at the avoided crossing and the effectively two-dimensional subspace of the full Hilbert space spanning the level crossing. This makes it possible to give the leading order behaviour for the search time and the localisation probability in the limit of large lattice size including the leading order coefficients. For d=2 and d=3, these coefficients are calculated explicitly. Closed form expressions are given for higher dimensions.

We present the detailed process of converting the classical Fourier Transform algorithm into the quantum one by using QR decomposition. This provides an example of a technique for building quantum algorithms using classical ones. The Quantum Fourier Transform is one of the most important quantum subroutines known at present, used in most algorithms that have exponential speed up compared to the classical ones. We briefly review Fast Fourier Transform and then make explicit all the steps that led to the quantum formulation of the algorithm, generalizing Coppersmith's work.

<p>
We present a novel scheme to generate entanglement between two spatially separated systems. The scheme makes use of spatial entanglement generated by a single-particle quantum walk which is used to entangle two spatially separated, not necessarily correlated, systems. This scheme can be used to entangle any two systems which can interact with the spatial modes entangled during the quantum walk evolution. A notable feature is that we can control the quantum walk dynamics and its ability to localize leads to a substantial control and improvement in the entanglement output.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4348  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study various types of multipartite states lying near the quantum-classical boundary. The class of so-called classical states are precisely those in which each party can perform a projective measurement to identify a locally held state without disturbing the global state, a task known as non-disruptive local state identification (NDLID). We introduce a new class of states called generalized-classical states which allow for NDLID when the most general quantum measurements are permitted. A simple analytic method as well as a physical criterion are presented for detecting whether a multipartite state is classical. To decide whether a state is generalized-classical, we provide a semi-definite programming algorithm which can be adapted for use in other unrelated contexts such as signal processing.

Phys. Rev. A 82, 042328 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4510  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations of a Bell diagonal state in a non-Markovian dephasing environment. The sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime is observed during the dynamics of such kind of Bell diagonal state. Due to the refocusing effect of the overall relative phase, the quantum correlation revives from near zero and then decays again in the subsequent evolution. However, the non-Markovian effect is too weak to revive the classical correlation, which remains constant in the same evolution range. With the implementation of an optical $\sigma_{x}$ operation, the sudden transition from quantum to classical revival regime is obtained and correlation echoes are formed. Our method can be used to control the revival time of correlations, which would be important in quantum memory.

We propose a procedure based on symplectic tomography for reconstructing the unknown parameters of a convolutionless non-Markovian Gaussian noisy evolution.

Two different approaches towards reconstruction, integral and differential, are presented and applied to a benchmark model made of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a bosonic bath. For this model the number of tomograms needed to retrieve the unknown parameters is explicitly computed.

We use four and six-photon inputs, to analyze the heralding process of two- and four-photon NOON states-a superposition of N photons in two paths, capable of enabling phase supersensitive measurements at the Heisenberg limit. Realistic devices will include imperfections; as part of the heralded state preparation, we demonstrate phase superresolution within our chip with a state that is more robust to photon loss.

Interface exchange effects enable an all electric manipulation of the spin and a switchable strong coupling to a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. Our setup does not rely on any specific band structure and can in principle be realized with many different types of nanoconductors. This allows to envision on-chip single spin manipulation and read-out using cavity QED techniques.

<p>
Qubits, the quantum mechanical bits required for quantum computing, must retain their fragile quantum states over long periods of time. In many types of electron spin qubits, the primary source of decoherence is the interaction between the electron spins and nuclear spins of the host lattice. For electrons in gate defined GaAs quantum dots, previous spin echo measurements have revealed coherence times of about 1 $\mu$s at low magnetic fields below 100 mT. Here, we show that coherence in such devices can actually survive to much longer times, and provide a detailed understanding of the measured nuclear spin induced decoherence. At fields above a few hundred millitesla, the coherence time measured using a single-pulse spin echo extends to 30 $\mu$s. At lower magnetic fields, the echo first collapses, but then revives at later times given by the period of the relative Larmor precession of different nuclear species. This behavior was recently predicted, and as we show can be quantitatively accounted for by a semi-classical model for the electron spin dynamics in the presence of a nuclear spin bath. Using a multiple-pulse Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo sequence, the decoherence time can be extended to more than 200 $\mu$s, which represents an improvement by two orders of magnitude compared to previous measurements. This demonstration of effective methods to mitigate nuclear spin induced decoherence puts the quantum error correction threshold within reach.

Transport properties are among the defining characteristics of many important phases in condensed matter physics. In the presence of strong correlations they are difficult to predict even for model systems like the Hubbard model. In real materials they are in general obscured by additional complications including impurities, lattice defects or multi-band effects. Ultracold atoms in contrast offer the possibility to study transport and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a clean and well-controlled environment and can therefore act as a quantum simulator for condensed matter systems. Here we studied the expansion of an initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous optical lattice. While we observe ballistic transport for non-interacting atoms, even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal with a dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard model.

**33.    Feshbach resonances of harmonically trapped atoms**  
Philipp-Immanuel Schneider, Yulian V. Vanne, Alejandro Saenz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5306  
<blockquote>
<p>
Employing a short-range two-channel description we derive an analytic model of atoms in isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps at a Feshbach resonance. On this basis we obtain a new parameterization of the energy-dependent scattering length which differs from the one previously employed. We validate the model by comparison to full numerical calculations for Li-Rb and explain quantitatively the experimental observation of a resonance shift and trap-induced molecules in exited bands. Finally, we analyze the bound state admixture and Landau-Zener transition probabilities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5463  
<blockquote>
<p>
This article is an attempt to provide a link between the quantum nonequilibrium dynamics of cold gases and fifty years of progress in the lowdimensional quantum chaos. We identify two atomic systems lying on the interface: two interacting atoms in a harmonic multimode waveguide and an interacting two-component Bose-Bose mixture in a double-well potential. In particular, we study the level spacing distribution, the wavefunction statistics, the eigenstate thermalization, and the ability to thermalize in a relaxation process as such.

**35.    The Ground State Energy of The Massless Spin-Boson Model**  
Abdelmalek Abdesselam  
Annales Henri Poincare 12:1321-1347,2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4366  
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide an explicit combinatorial expansion for the ground state energy of the massless spin-Boson model as a power series in the coupling parameter. Our method uses the technique of cluster expansion in constructive quantum field theory and takes as a starting point the functional integral representation and its reduction to an Ising model on the real line with long range interactions. We prove the analyticity of our expansion and provide an explicit lower bound on the radius of convergence. We do not need multiscale nor renormalization group analysis. A connection to the loop-erased random walk is indicated.

<p>
Fermi gases confined in tight one-dimensional waveguides form two-particle bound states of atoms in the presence of a strongly attractive interaction. Based on the exact solution of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 interacting Fermi gas, we demonstrate that a stable excited state with no pairing between attractive fermionic atoms can be realized by a sudden switch of interaction from strongly repulsive regime to the strongly attractive regime. Such a state is an exact fermionic analog of the experimentally observed super-Tonks-Girardeau state of bosonic Cesium atoms [Science 325, 1224 (2009)] and should be possible to be observed by the experiment. The frequency of lowest breathing mode of the fermionic super-Tonks-Girardeau gas is calculated as a function of the interaction strength, which could be used as a detectable signature for the experimental observation.
