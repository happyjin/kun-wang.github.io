**1.    Exact analytical results for quantum walks on star graph**  
Xinping Xu  
J. Phys. A 42, 115205 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1149  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study coherent exciton transport of continuous-time quantum walks on star graph. Exact analytical results of the transition probabilities are obtained by means of the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of the eigenstates. Our results show that the coherent exciton transport displays perfect revivals and strong localization on the initial node. When the initial excitation starts at the central node, the transport on star graph is equivalent to the transport on a complete graph of the same size.

**2.    Frank-Condon principle and adjustment of optical waveguides with nonhomogeneous refractive indices**  
Vladimir I. Man'ko, Leonid D. Mikheev, Alexandr Sergeevich  
J. Russ. Laser Res., 30, 49 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1200  
<blockquote>
<p>
The adjustment of two different selfocs is considered using both exact formulas for the mode-connection coefficients expressed in terms of Hermite polynomials of several variables and a qualitative approach based on the Frank-Condon principle. Several examples of the refractive-index dependence are studied and illustrative plots for these examples are presented. The connection with the tomographic approach to quantum states of a two-dimensional oscillator and the Frank-Condon factors is established.

**3.    The quantum query complexity of certification**  
Andris Ambainis, Andrew M. Childs, Fran?ois Le Gall, Seiichiro Tani  
Quantum Information and Computation 10, 181-188 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1291  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the quantum query complexity of finding a certificate for a d-regular, k-level balanced NAND formula. Up to logarithmic factors, we show that the query complexity is Theta(d^{(k+1)/2}) for 0-certificates, and Theta(d^{k/2}) for 1-certificates. In particular, this shows that the zero-error quantum query complexity of evaluating such formulas is O(d^{(k+1)/2}) (again neglecting a logarithmic factor). Our lower bound relies on the fact that the quantum adversary method obeys a direct sum theorem.

**4.    The Arrow Calculus as a Quantum Programming Language**  
Juliana Kaizer Vizzotto, Andre Rauber Du Bois, Amr Sabry  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1489  
<blockquote>
<p>
We express quantum computations (with measurements) using the arrow calculus extended with monadic constructions. This framework expresses quantum programming using well-understood and familiar classical patterns for programming in the presence of computational effects. In addition, the five laws of the arrow calculus provide a convenient framework for equational reasoning about quantum computations that include measurements.

**5.    Slot-waveguide cavities for optical quantum information applications**  
Mark P. Hiscocks, Chun-Hsu Su, Brant C. Gibson, Andrew D. Greentree, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg, Francois Ladouceur  
Opt.Express.17:7295-7303,2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2308  
<blockquote>
<p>
To take existing quantum optical experiments and devices into more practical regimes requires the construction of robust, solid-state implementations. In particular, to observe the strong-coupling regime of atom-photon interactions requires very small cavities and large quality factors. Here we show that the slot-waveguide geometry recently introduced for photonic applications is also promising for quantum optical applications in the visible regime. We study diamond- and GaP-based slot-waveguide cavities (SWCs) compatible with diamond colour centres e.g. nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect, and show that one can achieve increased single-photon Rabi frequencies of order O(10^11) Hz in ultra-small cavity modal volumes, nearly 2 orders of magnitude smaller than previously studied diamond-based photonic crystal cavities.

**6.    Reversing the Weak Quantum Measurement for a Photonic Qubit**  
Yong-Su Kim, Young-Wook Cho, Young-Sik Ra, Yoon-Ho Kim  
Opt. Express 17, 11978 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3077  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the conditional reversal of a weak (partial-collapse) quantum measurement on a photonic qubit. The weak quantum measurement causes a nonunitary transformation of a qubit which is subsequently reversed to the original state after a successful reversing operation. Both the weak measurement and the reversal operation are implemented linear optically. The state recovery fidelity, determined by quantum process tomography, is shown to be over 94% for partial-collapse strength up to 0.9. We also experimentally study information gain due to the weak measurement and discuss the role of the reversing operation as an information erasure.

**7.    Quantum-Secure Coin-Flipping and Applications**  
Ivan Damgaard, Carolin Lunemann  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3118  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we prove classical coin-flipping secure in the presence of quantum adversaries. The proof uses a recent result of Watrous [Wat09] that allows quantum rewinding for protocols of a certain form. We then discuss two applications. First, the combination of coin-flipping with any non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol leads to an easy transformation from non-interactive zero-knowledge to interactive quantum zero-knowledge. Second, we discuss how our protocol can be applied to a recently proposed method for improving the security of quantum protocols [DFL+09], resulting in an implementation without set-up assumptions. Finally, we sketch how to achieve efficient simulation for an extended construction in the common-reference-string model.

**8.    Ab-initio determination of Bose-Hubbard parameters for two ultracold atoms in an optical lattice using a three-well potential**  
Philipp-Immanuel Schneider, Sergey Grishkevich, Alejandro Saenz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3185  
<blockquote>
<p>
We calculate numerically the exact energy spectrum of the six dimensional problem of two interacting Bosons in a three-well optical lattice. The particles interact via a full Born-Oppenheimer potential which can be adapted to model the behavior of the s-wave scattering length at Feshbach resonances. By adjusting the parameters of the corresponding Bose-Hubbard (BH) Hamiltonian the deviation between the numerical energy spectrum and the BH spectrum is minimized. This defines the optimal BH parameter set which we compare to the standard parameters of the BH model. The range of validity of the BH model with these parameter sets is examined, and an improved analytical prediction of the interaction parameter is introduced. Furthermore, an extended BH model and implications due to the energy dependence of the scattering length and couplings to higher Bloch bands at a Feshbach resonance are discussed.

**9.    Continuous-Time Quantum Walks and Trapping**  
Elena Agliari, Oliver Muelken, Alexander Blumen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3288  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent findings suggest that processes such as the electronic energy transfer through the photosynthetic antenna display quantal features, aspects known from the dynamics of charge carriers along polymer backbones. Hence, in modeling energy transfer one has to leave the classical, master-equation-type formalism and advance towards an increasingly quantum-mechanical picture, while still retaining a local description of the complex network of molecules involved in the transport, say through a tight-binding approach. Interestingly, the continuous time random walk (CTRW) picture, widely employed in describing transport in random environments, can be mathematically reformulated to yield a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of tight-binding type; the procedure uses the mathematical analogies between time-evolution operators in statistical and in quantum mechanics: The result are continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs). However, beyond these formal analogies, CTRWs and CTQWs display vastly different physical properties. In particular, here we focus on trapping processes on a ring and show, both analytically and numerically, that distinct configurations of traps (ranging from periodical to random) yield strongly different behaviours for the quantal mean survival probability, while classically (under ordered conditions) we always find an exponential decay at long times.

**10.    Efficient Circuits for Quantum Walks**  
Chen-Fu Chiang, Daniel Nagaj, Pawel Wocjan  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol.10, No.5&6, pp0420-0434 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3465  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient general method for realizing a quantum walk operator corresponding to an arbitrary sparse classical random walk. Our approach is based on Grover and Rudolph's method for preparing coherent versions of efficiently integrable probability distributions. This method is intended for use in quantum walk algorithms with polynomial speedups, whose complexity is usually measured in terms of how many times we have to apply a step of a quantum walk, compared to the number of necessary classical Markov chain steps. We consider a finer notion of complexity including the number of elementary gates it takes to implement each step of the quantum walk with some desired accuracy. The difference in complexity for various implementation approaches is that our method scales linearly in the sparsity parameter and poly-logarithmically with the inverse of the desired precision. The best previously known general methods either scale quadratically in the sparsity parameter, or polynomially in the inverse precision. Our approach is especially relevant for implementing quantum walks corresponding to classical random walks like those used in the classical algorithms for approximating permanents and sampling from binary contingency tables. In those algorithms, the sparsity parameter grows with the problem size, while maintaining high precision is required.

**11.    Non Markovian Quantum Repeated Interactions and Measurements**  
C Pellegrini, F Petruccione  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3859  
<blockquote>
<p>
A non-Markovian model of quantum repeated interactions between a small quantum system and an infinite chain of quantum systems is presented. By adapting and applying usual pro jection operator techniques in this context, discrete versions of the integro-differential and time-convolutioness Master equations for the reduced system are derived. Next, an intuitive and rigorous description of the indirect quantum measurement principle is developed and a discrete non Markovian stochastic Master equation for the open system is obtained. Finally, the question of unravelling in a particular model of non-Markovian quantum interactions is discussed.

Masatoshi Hamada, Norio Konno, Wojciech Mlotkowski  
Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Vol.15, No.3, pp.367-375 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4047  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we obtain some properties of orthogonal polynomials given by a weight function which is a limit density of a rescaled discrete-time quantum walk on the line.

**13.    Generalized Toffoli gates using qudit catalysis**  
Radu Ionicioiu, Timothy P. Spiller, William J. Munro  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 012312 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4123  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present quantum networks for a n-qubit controlled gate C^{n-1}(U) which use a higher dimensional (qudit) ancilla as a catalyser. In its simplest form the network has only n two-particle gates (qubit-qudit) -- this is the minimum number of two-body interactions needed to couple all n+1 subsystems (n qubits plus one ancilla). This class of controlled gates includes the generalised Toffoli gate C^{n-1}(X) on n qubits, which plays an important role in several quantum algorithms and error correction. A particular example implementing this model is given by the dispersive limit of a generalised Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of an effective spin-s interacting with a cavity mode.

**14.    Sudden death and birth of entanglement beyond the Markovian approximation**  
Z. Y. Xu, M. Feng  
Physics Letters A 373 (2009) 1906-1910  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4225  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two initially entangled qubits interacting independently with two uncorrelated reservoirs beyond the Markovian approximation. Quite different from the Markovian reservoirs [C. E. Lopez et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 (2008) 080503], we find that entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the two reservoirs occurs without certain symmetry with respect to the entanglement sudden death (ESD) of the two qubits. A phenomenological interpretation of entanglement revival is also given.

**15.    Limit theorems for discrete-time quantum walks on trees**  
Kota Chisaki, Masatoshi Hamada, Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa  
Interdisciplinary Information Sciences 15, 423-429 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4508  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a discrete-time quantum walk W_t given by the Grover transformation on the Cayley tree. We reduce W_t to a quantum walk X_t on a half line with a wall at the origin. This paper presents two types of limit theorems for X_t. The first one is X_t as t\to\infty, which corresponds to a localization in the case of an initial qubit state. The second one is X_t/t as t\to\infty, whose limit density is given by the Konno density function [1-4]. The density appears in various situations of discrete-time cases. The corresponding similar limit theorem was proved in [5] for a continuous-time case on the Cayley tree.

**16.    Broad-band spectral control of single photon sources using a nonlinear photonic crystal cavity**  
Murray W. McCutcheon, Darrick E. Chang, Yinan Zhang, Mikhail D. Lukin, Marko Loncar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4706  
<blockquote>
<p>
Motivated by developments in quantum information science, much recent effort has been directed toward coupling individual quantum emitters to optical microcavities. Such systems can be used to produce single photons on demand, enable nonlinear optical switching at a single photon level, and implement functional nodes of a quantum network, where the emitters serve as processing nodes and photons are used for long-distance quantum communication. For many of these practical applications, it is important to develop techniques that allow one to generate outgoing single photons of desired frequency and bandwidth, enabling hybrid networks connecting different types of emitters and long-distance transmission over telecommunications wavelengths. Here, we propose a novel approach that makes use of a nonlinear optical resonator, in which the single photon originating from the atom-like emitter is directly converted into a photon with desired frequency and bandwidth using the intracavity nonlinearity. As specific examples, we discuss a high-finesse, TE-TM double-mode photonic crystal cavity design that allows for direct generation of single photons at telecom wavelengths starting from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot with a 950 nm transition wavelength, and a scheme for direct optical coupling of such a quantum dot with a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center at 637 nm.

**17.    Public-key cryptography based on bounded quantum reference frames**  
Lawrence M. Ioannou, Michele Mosca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5156  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that the framework of bounded quantum reference frames has application to building quantum-public-key cryptographic protocols and proving their security. Thus, the framework we introduce can be seen as a public-key analogue of the framework of Bartlett et al. (Phys. Rev. A 70, 032307), where a private shared reference frame is shown to have cryptographic application. The protocol we present in this paper is an identification scheme, which, like a digital signature scheme, is a type of authentication scheme. We prove that our protocol is both reusable and secure under the honest-verifier assumption. Thus, we also demonstrate that secure reusable quantum-public-key authentication is possible to some extent.

**18.    Implementation of the quantum walk step operator in lateral quantum dots**  
K.A. van Hoogdalem, M. Blaauboer  
Phys. Rev. B 80, 125309 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1236  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a physical implementation of the step operator of the discrete quantum walk for an electron in a one-dimensional chain of quantum dots. The operating principle of the step operator is based on locally enhanced Zeeman splitting and the role of the quantum coin is played by the spin of the electron. We calculate the probability of successful transfer of the electron in the presence of decoherence due to quantum charge fluctuations, modeled as a bosonic bath. We then analyze two mechanisms for creating locally enhanced Zeeman splitting based on, respectively, locally applied electric and magnetic fields and slanting magnetic fields. Our results imply that a success probability of > 90% is feasible under realistic experimental conditions.

**19.    The Jahn-Teller instability in dissipative quantum electromechanical systems**  
Charles P. Meaney, Tim Duty, Ross H. McKenzie, Gerard J. Milburn  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 043805 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2681  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the steady states of a harmonic oscillator coupled so strongly to a two-level system (a qubit) that the rotating wave approximation cannot be made. The Hamiltonian version of this model is known as the $E\otimes\beta$ Jahn-Teller model. The semiclassical version of this system exhibits a fixed point bifurcation, which in the quantum model leads to a ground state with substantial entanglement between the oscillator and the qubit. We show that the dynamical bifurcation survives in a dissipative quantum description of the system, amidst an even richer bifurcation structure. We propose two experimental implementations of this model based on superconducting cavities: a parametrically driven nonlinear nanomechanical resonator coupled capacitively to a coplanar microwave cavity and a superconducting junction in the central conductor of a coplanar waveguide.

**20.    Coherent control of an effective two-level system in a non-Markovian biomolecular environment**  
Jens Eckel, John Henry Reina, Michael Thorwart  
New J. Phys. 11, 085001 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2936  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the quantum coherent dynamics of an externally driven effective two-level system subjected to a slow Ohmic environment characteristic of biomolecular protein-solvent reservoirs in photosynthetic light harvesting complexes. By means of the numerically exact quasi adiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) method we are able to include non-Markovian features of the environment and show the dependence of the quantum coherence on the characteristic bath cut-off frequency omega_c as well as on the driving frequency omega_l and the field amplitude A. Our calculations extend from the weak coupling regime to the incoherent strong coupling regime. In the latter case, we find evidence for a resonant behaviour, beyond the expected behaviour, when the reorganization energy E_r coincides with the driving frequency. Moreover, we investigate how the coherent destruction of tunneling within the two-level system is influenced by the non-Markovian environment.

**21.    Convergent relaxations of polynomial optimization problems with non-commuting variables**  
Stefano Pironio, Miguel Navascues, Antonio Acin  
SIAM J. Optim. Volume 20, Issue 5, pp. 2157-2180 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4368  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider optimization problems with polynomial inequality constraints in non-commuting variables. These non-commuting variables are viewed as bounded operators on a Hilbert space whose dimension is not fixed and the associated polynomial inequalities as semidefinite positivity constraints. Such problems arise naturally in quantum theory and quantum information science. To solve them, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations which generates a monotone sequence of lower bounds that converges to the optimal solution. We also introduce a criterion to detect whether the global optimum is reached at a given relaxation step and show how to extract a global optimizer from the solution of the corresponding semidefinite programming problem.
