**1.    Entanglement of Subspaces and Error Correcting Codes**  
Gilad Gour, Nolan R. Wallach  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 042309 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0251  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.

**2.    Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement**  
Matthaeus Halder, Alexios Beveratos, Nicolas Gisin, Valerio Scarani, Christoph Simon, Hugo Zbinden  
Nature Physics 3, 692 - 695 (2007)

<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be "swapped": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a "Bell-State Measurement", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

**3.    Distributed quantum information processing with minimal local resources**  
Earl T. Campbell  
Phys. Rev. A (Rapid Comm) 76, 040302(R) (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1464  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way quantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly imperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits, requiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli error, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce local resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of purification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a biased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more rapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented of how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a single Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\sim 10$ times the imperfection in local operations.

**4.    Measuring two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement**  
G. F. Calvo, A. Picón, A. Bramon  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 012319 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1506  
<blockquote>
<p>
We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.

**5.    Entanglement condition via su(2) and su(1,1) algebra using Schr{?}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation**  
Hyunchul Nha  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 014305 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1939  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Schr{\"o}dinger-Robertson inequality generally provides a stronger bound on the product of uncertainties for two noncommuting observables than the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, and as such, it can yield a stricter separability condition in conjunction with partial transposition. In this paper, using the Schr{\"o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, the separability condition previously derived from the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra is made stricter and refined to a form invariant with respect to local phase shifts. Furthermore, a linear optical scheme is proposed to test this invariant separability condition.

**6.    Probabilités et fluctuations quantiques (Probabilities and quantum fluctuations)**  
Michel Fliess  
Comptes rendus de l'acad\'emie des sciences, Math\'ematiques 344 (2007) 663-668  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2019  
<blockquote>
<p>
This note is sketching a simple and natural mathematical construction for explaining the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. It employs nonstandard analysis and is based on Feynman's interpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, i.e., of the quantum fluctuations, which was brought to the forefront in some fractal approaches. It results, as in Nelson's stochastic mechanics, in stochastic differential equations which are deduced from infinitesimal random walks. An extended english abstract gives most of the details.

**7.    Discrete quantum Fourier transform in coupled semiconductor double quantum dot molecules**  
Ping Dong, Ming Yang, Zhuo-Liang Cao  
Physics Letters A 373 (2008) 30-32  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2091  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this Letter, we present a physical scheme for implementing the discrete quantum Fourier transform in a coupled semiconductor double quantum dot system. The main controlled-R gate operation can be decomposed into many simple and feasible unitary transformations. The current scheme would be a useful step towards the realization of complex quantum algorithms in the quantum dot system.

**8.    Multi-qubit stabilizer and cluster entanglement witnesses**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, G. Najarbashi, Y. Akbari, H. Habibian  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2414  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the problems concerning entanglement witnesses (EWs) is the construction of them by a given set of operators. Here several multi-qubit EWs called stabilizer EWs are constructed by using the stabilizer operators of some given multi-qubit states such as GHZ, cluster and exceptional states. The general approach to manipulate the multi-qubit stabilizer EWs by exact(approximate) linear programming (LP) method is described and it is shown that the Clifford group play a crucial role in finding the hyper-planes encircling the feasible region. The optimality, decomposability and non-decomposability of constructed stabilizer EWs are discussed.

**9.    Investigation of continuous-time quantum walks via spectral analysis and Laplace transform**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, R. Sufiani  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2602  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a given graph is investigated by using the techniques of the spectral analysis and inverse Laplace transform of the Stieltjes function (Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution) associated with the graph. It is shown that, the probability amplitude of observing the CTQW at a given site at time $t$ is related to the inverse Laplace transformation of the Stieltjes function, namely, one can calculate the probability amplitudes only by taking the inverse laplace transform of the function $iG_{\mu}(is)$, where $G_{\mu}(x)$ is the Stieltjes function of the graph. The preference of this procedure is that, there is no any need to know the spectrum of the graph

**10.    A remark on helical waveguides**  
Pavel Exner, Martin Fraas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2770  
<blockquote>
<p>
Motivated by a proposal to create an optical helix-shaped waveguides for cold atoms and molecules, we discuss local perturbations which can create bound states in such a setting. This is known about a local slowdown of the twist; we show that a similar effect can result from a local tube protrusion or a change of the helix radius in correlation with its pitch angle.

**11.    Quantum Parrondo's game with random strategies**  
J. Kosik, J. A. Miszczak, V. Buzek  
J. Mod. Optics, Vol. 54, 13 (2007), pp. 2275 - 2287  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2937  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum implementation of Parrondo's game with randomly switched strategies using 1) a quantum walk as a source of ``randomness'' and 2) a completely positive (CP) map as a randomized evolution. The game exhibits the same paradox as in the classical setting where a combination of two losing strategies might result in a winning strategy. We show that the CP-map scheme leads to significantly lower net gain than the quantum walk scheme.

**12.    Selective cloning of Gaussian states by linear optics**  
Stefano Olivares  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 022305 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2952  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the performances of a selective cloning machine based on linear optical elements and Gaussian measurements, which allows to clone at will one of the two incoming input states. This machine is a complete generalization of a 1 to 2 cloning scheme demonstrated by U. L. Andersen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 94, 240503 (2005)]. The input-output fidelity is studied for generic Gaussian input state and the effect of non-unit quantum efficiency is also taken into account. We show that if the states to be cloned are squeezed states with known squeezing parameter, then the fidelity can be enhanced using a third suitable squeezed state during the final stage of the cloning process. A binary communication protocol based on the selective cloning machne is also discussed.

**13.    The effect of dissipation on quantum transmission resonance**  
Kohkichi Konno, Munehiro Nishida, Satoshi Tanda, Noriyuki Hatakenaka  
Physics Letters A 368 (2007) 442-449  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3300  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum transmissions of a free particle passing through a rectangular potential barrier with dissipation are studied using a path decomposition technique. Dissipative processes strongly suppress the transmission probability at resonance just above the barrier resulting in an unexpected reduction of the mean traversal time through the potential barrier.

**14.    Two-color atom guide and 1D optical lattice using evanescent fields of high-order transverse modes**  
Jian Fu, Xiang Yin, Limin Tong  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3460  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a two-color scheme of atom guide and 1D optical lattice using evanescent light fields of different transverse modes. The optical waveguide carries a red-detuned light and a blue-detuned light, with both modes far from resonance. The atom guide and 1D optical lattice potentials can be transformed to each other by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to accurately control mode transformation. This might provide a new approach to realize flexible transition between the guiding and trapping states of atoms.

**16.    Effects of frequency correlation in linear optical entangling gate operated with independent photons**  
Marco Barbieri  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 043825 (2007).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3763  
<blockquote>
<p>
Bose-Einstein coalescence of independent photons at the surface of a beam splitter is the physical process that allows linear optical quantum gates to be built. When distinct parametric down-conversion events are used as an independent photon source, distinguishability arises form the energy correlation of each photon with its twin. We find that increasing the pump bandwidth may help in improving the visibility of non-classical interference and reaching a level of near perfect indistinguishability.

**17.    Computation and visualization of Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries: non-monotonic lateral forces and failure of proximity-force approximations**  
Alejandro Rodriguez, Mihai Ibanescu, Davide Iannuzzi, Federico Capasso, John D. Joannopoulos, Steven G. Johnson  
Physical Review Letters, Vol. 99, No. 8, 80401 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1890  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries, with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls.

**18.    Nontrivial edge coupling from a Dirichlet network squeezing: the case of a bent waveguide**  
Claudio Cacciapuoti, Pavel Exner  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2912  
<blockquote>
<p>
In distinction to the Neumann case the squeezing limit of a Dirichlet network leads in the threshold region generically to a quantum graph with disconnected edges, exceptions may come from threshold resonances. Our main point in this paper is to show that modifying locally the geometry we can achieve in the limit a nontrivial coupling between the edges including, in particular, the class of $\delta$-type boundary conditions. We work out an illustration of this claim in the simplest case when a bent waveguide is squeezed.

**19.    Anderson localization and nonlinearity in one dimensional disordered photonic lattices**  
Yoav Lahini, Assaf Avidan, Francesca Pozzi, Marc Sorel, Roberto Morandotti, Demetrios N. Christodoulides, Yaron Silberberg  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 013906 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3788  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate the evolution of linear and nonlinear waves in a realization of the Anderson model using disordered one dimensional waveguide lattices. Two types of localized eigenmodes, flat-phased and staggered, are directly measured. Nonlinear perturbations enhances localization in one type, and induce delocalization in the other. In a complementary approach, we study the evolution on short time scales of $\delta$-like wavepackets in the presence of disorder. A transition from ballistic wavepacket expansion to exponential (Anderson) localization is observed. We find an intermediate regime in which the ballistic and localized components coexist while diffusive dynamics is absent. Evidence is found for a faster transition into localization under nonlinear conditions.
