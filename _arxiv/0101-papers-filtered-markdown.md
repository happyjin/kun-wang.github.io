**1.    Quantum Networks for Concentrating Entanglement**  
Phillip Kaye, Michele Mosca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101009  
<blockquote>
<p>
If two parties, Alice and Bob, share some number, n, of partially entangled pairs of qubits, then it is possible for them to concentrate these pairs into some smaller number of maximally entangled states. We present a simplified version of the algorithm for such entanglement concentration, and we describe efficient networks for implementing these operations.

**2.    Entangled state based on nonorthogonal state**  
Osamu Hirota, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101018  
<blockquote>
<p>
Properties of entangled states based on nonorthogonal states are clarified. Especially, it is shown that they can have complete degree of entanglement.

**3.    Nonlinear optics with less than one photon**  
K.J. Resch, J.S. Lundeen, A.M. Steinberg  
Physical Review Letters 87, 123603 (2001).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101020  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate suppression and enhancement of spontaneous parametric down- conversion via quantum interference with two weak fields from a local oscillator (LO). Pairs of LO photons are observed to upconvert with high efficiency for appropriate phase settings, exhibiting an effective nonlinearity enhanced by at least 10 orders of magnitude. This constitutes a two-photon switch, and promises to be useful for a variety of nonlinear optical effects at the quantum level.

**4.    Topological Quantum Computation**  
Michael H. Freedman, Alexei Kitaev, Michael J. Larsen, Zhenghan Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101025  
<blockquote>
<p>
The theory of quantum computation can be constructed from the abstract study of anyonic systems. In mathematical terms, these are unitary topological modular functors. They underlie the Jones polynomial and arise in Witten-Chern-Simons theory. The braiding and fusion of anyonic excitations in quantum Hall electron liquids and 2D-magnets are modeled by modular functors, opening a new possibility for the realization of quantum computers. The chief advantage of anyonic computation would be physical error correction: An error rate scaling like $e^{-\a\l}$, where $\l$ is a length scale, and $\alpha$ is some positive constant. In contrast, the $\q$presumptive" qubit-model of quantum computation, which repairs errors combinatorically, requires a fantastically low initial error rate (about $10^{-4}$) before computation can be stabilized.

**5.    Decomposing Finite Abelian Groups**  
Kevin K. H. Cheung, Michele Mosca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0101004  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper describes a quantum algorithm for efficiently decomposing finite Abelian groups. Such a decomposition is needed in order to apply the Abelian hidden subgroup algorithm. Such a decomposition (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) also leads to an efficient algorithm for computing class numbers (known to be at least as difficult as factoring).
