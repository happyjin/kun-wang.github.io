**1.    Noisy Grover's search algorithm**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Christos Konstadakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110010  
<blockquote>
<p>
External environment influences on Grover's search algorithm modeled by quantum noise are investigated. The algorithm is shown to be robust under that external dissipation. Explicitly we prove that the resulting search positive maps acting on unsorted N-dimensional database made of projective density matrices depend on x the strength of the environment, and that there are infinitely many x values for which search is successful after O(\sqrt{N}) queries. These algorithms are quantum entropy increasing.

**2.    Extracting Quantum Entanglement (General Entanglement Purification Protocols)**  
Andris Ambainis, Ke Yang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110011  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the problem of general entanglement purification protocols. Suppose Alice and Bob share a bipartite state $\rho$ which is ``reasonably close'' to perfect EPR pairs. The only information Alice and Bob possess is a lower bound on the fidelity of $\rho$ and a maximally entangled state. They wish to ``purify'' $\rho$ using local operations and classical communication and create a state that is arbitrarily close to EPR pairs. We prove that on average, Alice and Bob cannot increase the fidelity of the input state significantly. We also construct protocols that may fail with a small probability, and otherwise will output states arbitrarily close to EPR pairs with very high probability. Our constructions are efficient, i.e., they can be implemented by polynomial-size quantum circuits.

**3.    Quantum channel of continuous variable teleportation and nonclassicality of quantum states**  
Masahiro Takeoka, Masashi Ban, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110031  
<blockquote>
<p>
Noisy teleportation of nonclassical quantum states via a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state is studied with the completely positive map and the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. Using the nonclassical depth as a measure of transmission performance, we compare the teleportation scheme with the direct transmission through a noisy channel. The noise model is based on the coupling to the vacuum field. It is shown that the teleportation channel has better transmission performance than the direct transmission channel in a certain region. The bounds for such region and for obtaining the nonvanished nonclassicality of the teleported quantum states are also discussed. Our model shows a reasonable agreement with the observed teleportation fidelity in the experiment by Furusawa et al. [Science {\bf 282}, 706 (1998)]. We finally mention the required conditions for transmitting nonclassical features in real experiments.

**4.    Implementation of quantum search algorithm using classical Fourier optics**  
N. Bhattacharya, H. B. van Linden van den Heuvell, R. J. C. Spreeuw  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 137901 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110034  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on an experiment on Grover's quantum search algorithm showing that {\em classical waves} can search a $N$-item database as efficiently as quantum mechanics can. The transverse beam profile of a short laser pulse is processed iteratively as the pulse bounces back and forth between two mirrors. We directly observe the sought item being found in $\sim\sqrt{N}$ iterations, in the form of a growing intensity peak on this profile. Although the lack of quantum entanglement limits the {\em size} of our database, our results show that entanglement is neither necessary for the algorithm itself, nor for its efficiency.

**5.    Are Quantum Computing Models Realistic?**  
Subhash Kak  
ACM Ubiquity, 7 (11): 1-9, 2006  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110040  
<blockquote>
<p>
The commonly used circuit model of quantum computing leaves out the problems of imprecision in the initial state preparation, particle statistics (indistinguishability of particles belonging to the same quantum state), and error correction (current techniques cannot correct all small errors). The initial state in the circuit model computation is obtained by applying potentially imprecise Hadamard gate operations whereas useful quantum computation requires a state with no uncertainty. We review some limitations of the circuit model and speculate on the question if a hierarchy of quantum-type computing models exists.

<p>
A dynamical treatment of Markovian diffusion is presented and several applications discussed. The stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics is considered within this framework. A model for Brownian movement which includes second order quantum effects is derived.

**7.    Similarity between Grover's quantum search algorithm and classical two-body collisions**  
Jingfu Zhang, Zhiheng Lu  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110077  
<blockquote>
<p>
By studying the attribute of the inversion about average operation in quantum searching algorithm, we find the similarity between the quantum searching and the course of two rigid bodies'collision. Some related questions are discussed from this similarity.

**8.    Decoherence on Grover's quantum algorithm: perturbative approach**  
Hiroo Azuma  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 042311 (2002); Phys. Rev. A 66, 019903(E) (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110101  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study decoherence on Grover's quantum searching algorithm using a perturbative method. We assume that each two-state system (qubit) suffers \sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\leq p\leq 1) independently at every step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which Grover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit. (In this large n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\geq 0) can take any real positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an arbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth order term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative parameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of probability P_{th} or more. It satisfies 2Mnp<(8/5)(1-P_{th}) around 2Mnp\simeq 0 and P_{th}\simeq 1, and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of P_{th} approximately. This observation is similar to a result obtained by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani concerning accuracy of quantum gates for general algorithms. We cannot investigate a quantum to classical phase transition of the algorithm, because it is outside the reliable domain of our perturbation theory.

**9.    Continuous quantum error correction via quantum feedback control**  
Charlene Ahn, Andrew C. Doherty, Andrew J. Landahl  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 042301 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110111  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a protocol for continuously protecting unknown quantum states from decoherence that incorporates design principles from both quantum error correction and quantum feedback control. Our protocol uses continuous measurements and Hamiltonian operations, which are weaker control tools than are typically assumed for quantum error correction. We develop a cost function appropriate for unknown quantum states and use it to optimize our state-estimate feedback. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study our protocol for the three-qubit bit-flip code in detail and demonstrate that it can improve the fidelity of quantum states beyond what is achievable using quantum error correction when the time between quantum error correction cycles is limited.

Proceedings of the 7th international symposium on Foundations of Quantum Mechanics in the Light of New Technology, edited by Y.A. Ono and K. Fujikawa, World Scientific 2002  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110127  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the loss of fidelity in continuous variable teleportation due to non-maximal entanglement. It is shown that the quantum state distortions correspond to the measurement back-action of a field amplitude measurement. Results for coherent states and for photon number states are presented.

**11.    The feasible generation of entangled photon states by using linear optical elements**  
XuBo Zou, K. Pahlke, W. Mathis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110168  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a feasible scheme to produce a polarization-entangled photon states $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H>|V>+|V>|H>)$ in a controllable way. This scheme requires single-photon sources, linear optical elements and photon detectors. It generates the entanglement of spatially separated photons. The interaction takes place in the photon detectors. We also show that the same idea can be used to produce the entangled $N$-photon state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0,N>+|N,0>)$
