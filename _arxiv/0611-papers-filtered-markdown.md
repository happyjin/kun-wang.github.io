**1.    Wigner formula of rotation matrices and quantum walks**  
Takahiro Miyazaki, Makoto Katori, Norio Konno  
Phys. Rev. A76 (2007) 012332/1-14  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611022  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantization of a random-walk model is performed by giving a qudit (a multi-component wave function) to a walker at site and by introducing a quantum coin, which is a matrix representation of a unitary transformation. In quantum walks, the qudit of walker is mixed according to the quantum coin at each time step, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum walks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun, Carteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as the unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum coins. We show that Wigner's $(2j+1)$-dimensional unitary representations of rotations with half-integers $j$'s are useful to analyze the probability laws of quantum walks. For any value of half-integer $j$, convergence of all moments of walker's pseudovelocity in the long-time limit is proved. It is generally shown for the present models that, if $(2j+1)$ is even, the probability measure of limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled Konno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$ terms of scaled Konno's density functions and a Dirac's delta function at the origin. For the two-, three-, and four-component models, the probability densities of limit distributions are explicitly calculated and their dependence on the parameters of quantum coins and on the initial qudit of walker is completely determined. Comparison with computer simulation results is also shown.

**2.    Electron Fabry-Perot interferometer with two entangled magnetic impurities**  
F. Ciccarello, G. M. Palma, M. Zarcone, Y. Omar, V. R. Vieira  
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40, 7993 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611025  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a one-dimensional (1D) wire along which single conduction electrons can propagate in the presence of two spin-1/2 magnetic impurities. The electron may be scattered by each impurity via a contact-exchange interaction and thus a spin-flip generally occurs at each scattering event. Adopting a quantum waveguide theory approach, we derive the stationary states of the system at all orders in the electron-impurity exchange coupling constant. This allows us to investigate electron transmission for arbitrary initial states of the two impurity spins. We show that for suitable electron wave vectors, the triplet and singlet maximally entangled spin states of the impurities can respectively largely inhibit the electron transport or make the wire completely transparent for any electron spin state. In the latter case, a resonance condition can always be found, representing an anomalous behaviour compared to typical decoherence induced by magnetic impurities. We provide an explanation for these phenomena in terms of the Hamiltonian symmetries. Finally, a scheme to generate maximally entangled spin states of the two impurities via electron scattering is proposed.

**3.    Introduction to error correcting codes in quantum computers**  
P. J. Salas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611026  
<blockquote>
<p>
The goal of this paper is to review the theoretical basis for achieving a faithful quantum information transmission and processing in the presence of noise. Initially encoding and decoding, implementing gates and quantum error correction will be considered error free. Finally we will relax this non realistic assumption, introducing the quantum fault-tolerant concept. The existence of an error threshold permits to conclude that there is no physical law preventing a quantum computer from being built. An error model based on the depolarizing channel will be able to provide a simple estimation of the storage or memory computation error threshold: < 5.2 10-5. The encoding is made by means of the [[7,1,3]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum code and the Shor's fault-tolerant method to measure the stabilizer's generators is used.

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611048  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the error in trapped-ion, hyperfine qubit, quantum gates due to spontaneous scattering of photons from the gate laser beams. We investigate single-qubit rotations that are based on stimulated Raman transitions and two-qubit entangling phase-gates that are based on spin-dependent optical dipole forces. This error is compared between different ion species currently being investigated as possible quantum information carriers. For both gate types we show that with realistic laser powers the scattering error can be reduced to below current estimates of the fault-tolerance error threshold.

**5.    Robustness of quantum Markov chains**  
Ben Ibinson, Noah Linden, Andreas Winter  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611057  
<blockquote>
<p>
If the conditional information of a classical probability distribution of three random variables is zero, then it obeys a Markov chain condition. If the conditional information is close to zero, then it is known that the distance (minimum relative entropy) of the distribution to the nearest Markov chain distribution is precisely the conditional information. We prove here that this simple situation does not obtain for quantum conditional information. We show that for tri-partite quantum states the quantum conditional information is always a lower bound for the minimum relative entropy distance to a quantum Markov chain state, but the distance can be much greater; indeed the two quantities can be of different asymptotic order and may even differ by a dimensional factor.

**6.    Some Possibility and Impossibility Results related to Discrete Fourier type transforms in Quantum Information**  
Arpita Maitra  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611060  
<blockquote>
<p>
Very recently the most general ensemble of qubits are identified using the notion of linearity; any of these qubits gets accepted by a Hadamard gate to generate the equal superposition of the qubit and its orthogonal. Towards more generalization, we investigate the possibility and impossibility results related to Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) type of operations for a more general set up of qutrits.

**7.    Unambiguous discrimination of mixed states: A description based on system-ancilla coupling**  
Xiang-Fa Zhou, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Guang-Can Guo  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 052314 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611095  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a general description on the unambiguous discrimination of mixed states according to the system-environment coupling, and present a procedure to reduce this to a standard semidefinite programming problem. In the two states case, we introduce the canonical vectors and partly simplify the problem to the case of discrimination between pairs of canonical vectors. By considering the positivity of the two by two matrices, we obtain a series of new upper bounds of the total success probability which depends on both the prior probabilities and specific state structures.

**8.    Non-Markovian Decay and Lasing Condition in an Optical Microcavity Coupled to a Structured Reservoir**  
Stefano Longhi  
Phys. Rev. A 74, 063826 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611113  
<blockquote>
<p>
The decay dynamics of the classical electromagnetic field in a leaky optical resonator supporting a single mode coupled to a structured continuum of modes (reservoir) is theoretically investigated, and the issue of threshold condition for lasing in presence of an inverted medium is comprehensively addressed. Specific analytical results are given for a single-mode microcavity resonantly coupled to a coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW), which supports a band of continuous modes acting as decay channels. For weak coupling, the usual exponential Weisskopf-Wigner (Markovian) decay of the field in the bare resonator is found, and the threshold for lasing increases linearly with the coupling strength. As the coupling between the microcavity and the structured reservoir increases, the field decay in the passive cavity shows non exponential features, and correspondingly the threshold for lasing ceases to increase, reaching a maximum and then starting to decrease as the coupling strength is further increased. A singular behavior for the "laser phase transition", which is a clear signature of strong non-Markovian dynamics, is found at critical values of the coupling between the microcavity and the reservoir.

**9.    Continuous-Time Quantum Random Walks Require Discrete Space**  
K. Manouchehri, J.B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611129  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks are shown to have non-intuitive dynamics which makes them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for long-standing open problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum computing. In the case of continuous-time quantum random walks, such peculiar dynamics can arise from simple evolution operators closely resembling the quantum free-wave propagator. We investigate the divergence of quantum walk dynamics from the free-wave evolution and show that in order for continuous-time quantum walks to display their characteristic propagation, the state space must be discrete. This behavior rules out many continuous quantum systems as possible candidates for implementing continuous-time quantum random walks.

**10.    Coherent control of photon transmission : slowing light in coupled resonator waveguide doped with $Λ$ Atoms**  
Lan Zhou, Jing Lu, C. P. Sun  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 012313 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611159  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid mechanism for coherent transmission of photons in the coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) by incorporating the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect into the controllable band gap structure of the CROW. Here, the configuration setup of system consists of a CROW with homogeneous couplings and the artificial atoms with $\Lambda$-type three levels doped in each cavity. The roles of three levels are completely considered based on a mean field approach where the collection of three-level atoms collectively behave as two-mode spin waves. We show that the dynamics of low excitations of atomic ensemble can be effectively described by an coupling boson model. The exactly solutions show that the light pulses can be stopped and stored coherently by adiabatically controlling the classical field.

**11.    Non-exponential decay via tunneling in tight-binding lattices and the optical Zeno effect**  
Stefano Longhi  
S. Longhi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 110402 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611164  
<blockquote>
<p>
An exactly-solvable model for the decay of a metastable state coupled to a semi-infinite tight-binding lattice, showing large deviations from exponential decay in the strong coupling regime, is presented. An optical realization of the lattice model, based on discrete diffraction in a semi-infinite array of tunneling-coupled optical waveguides, is proposed to test non-exponential decay and for the observation of an optical analog of the quantum Zeno effect.

**12.    Precision measurement with an optical Josephson junction**  
H. T. Ng, K. Burnett, J. A. Dunningham  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 063607 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611190  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a new type of Josephson device, the so-called "optical Josephson junction" as proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 170402 (2005). Two condensates are optically coupled through a waveguide by a pair of Bragg beams. This optical Josephson junction is analogous to the usual Josephson junction of two condensates weakly coupled via tunneling. We discuss the use of this optical Josephson junction, for making precision measurements.

**13.    Language Diversity of Measured Quantum Processes**  
Karoline Wiesner, James P. Crutchfield  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611203  
<blockquote>
<p>
The behavior of a quantum system depends on how it is measured. How much of what is observed comes from the structure of the quantum system itself and how much from the observer's choice of measurement? We explore these questions by analyzing the \emph{language diversity} of quantum finite-state generators. One result is a new way to distinguish quantum devices from their classical (stochastic) counterparts. While the diversity of languages generated by these two computational classes is the same in the case of periodic processes, quantum systems generally generate a wider range of languages than classical systems.

**14.    Non-Markovian generalization of the Lindblad theory of open quantum systems**  
Heinz-Peter Breuer  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 022103 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611208  
<blockquote>
<p>
A systematic approach to the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems is given by the projection operator techniques of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Combining these methods with concepts from quantum information theory and from the theory of positive maps, we derive a class of correlated projection superoperators that take into account in an efficient way statistical correlations between the open system and its environment. The result is used to develop a generalization of the Lindblad theory to the regime of highly non-Markovian quantum processes in structured environments.

**15.    Physical propositions and quantum languages**  
Claudio Garola  
International Journal of Theoretical Physics (2008), 47: 90-103  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611227  
<blockquote>
<p>
The word \textit{proposition} is used in physics with different meanings, which must be distinguished to avoid interpretational problems. We construct two languages $\mathcal{L}^{\ast}(x)$ and $\mathcal{L}(x)$ with classical set-theoretical semantics which allow us to illustrate those meanings and to show that the non-Boolean lattice of propositions of quantum logic (QL) can be obtained by selecting a subset of \textit{p-testable} propositions within the Boolean lattice of all propositions associated with sentences of $\mathcal{L}(x)$. Yet, the aforesaid semantics is incompatible with the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) because of known no-go theorems. But if one accepts our criticism of these theorems and the ensuing SR (semantic realism) interpretation of QM, the incompatibility disappears, and the classical and quantum notions of truth can coexist, since they refer to different metalinguistic concepts (\textit{truth} and \textit{verifiability according to QM}, respectively). Moreover one can construct a quantum language $\mathcal{L}_{TQ}(x)$ whose Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is isomorphic to QL, the sentences of which state (testable) properties of individual samples of physical systems, while standard QL does not bear this interpretation.

**16.    Approximate locality for quantum systems on graphs**  
Tobias J. Osborne  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140503 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611231  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this Letter we make progress on a longstanding open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis [Theory of Computing 1, 47 (2005)]: we show that if A is the adjacency matrix of a sufficiently sparse low-dimensional graph then the unitary operator e^{itA} can be approximated by a unitary operator U(t) whose sparsity pattern is exactly that of a low-dimensional graph which gets more dense as |t| increases. Secondly, we show that if U is a sparse unitary operator with a gap \Delta in its spectrum, then there exists an approximate logarithm H of U which is also sparse. The sparsity pattern of H gets more dense as 1/\Delta increases. These two results can be interpreted as a way to convert between local continuous-time and local discrete-time processes. As an example we show that the discrete-time coined quantum walk can be realised as an approximately local continuous-time quantum walk. Finally, we use our construction to provide a definition for a fractional quantum fourier transform.

**17.    Efficient classical simulation of the approximate quantum Fourier transform**  
Nadav Yoran, Anthony J. Short  
Phys. Rev. A 76, 042321 (2007).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611241  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method for classically simulating quantum circuits based on the tensor contraction model of Markov and Shi (quant-ph/0511069). Using this method we are able to classically simulate the approximate quantum Fourier transform in polynomial time. Moreover, our approach allows us to formulate a condition for the composability of simulable quantum circuits. We use this condition to show that any circuit composed of a constant number of approximate quantum Fourier transform circuits and log-depth circuits with limited interaction range can also be efficiently simulated.

**18.    Decoherence induced by interacting quantum spin baths**  
Davide Rossini, Tommaso Calarco, Vittorio Giovannetti, Simone Montangero, Rosario Fazio  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 032333 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611242  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study decoherence induced on a two-level system coupled to a one-dimensional quantum spin chain. We consider the cases where the dynamics of the chain is determined by the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian. This model of quantum baths can be of fundamental importance for the understanding of decoherence in open quantum systems, since it can be experimentally engineered by using atoms in optical lattices. As an example, here we show how to implement a pure dephasing model for a qubit system coupled to an interacting spin bath. We provide results that go beyond the case of a central spin coupled uniformly to all the spins of the bath, in particular showing what happens when the bath enters different phases, or becomes critical; we also study the dependence of the coherence loss on the number of bath spins to which the system is coupled and we describe a coupling-independent regime in which decoherence exhibits universal features, irrespective of the system-environment coupling strength. Finally, we establish a relation between decoherence and entanglement inside the bath. For the Ising and the XY models we are able to give an exact expression for the decay of coherences, while for the Heisenberg bath we resort to the numerical time-dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group.

**19.    High fidelity transfer of an arbitrary quantum state between harmonic oscillators**  
K. Jahne, B. Yurke, U. Gavish  
Phys. Rev. A 75, 010301(R) (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611249  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that by switching a specific time-dependent interaction between a harmonic oscillator and a transmission line (a waveguide, an optical fiber, etc.) the quantum state of the oscillator can be transferred into that of another oscillator coupled to the distant other end of the line, with a fidelity that is independent of the initial state of both oscillators. For a transfer time $T$, the fidelity approaches 1 exponentially in $\gamma T$ where $\gamma$ is a characteristic damping rate. Hence, a good fidelity is achieved even for a transfer time of a few damping times. Some implementations are discussed.

**20.    Manipulating Multi-qudit Entanglement Witnesses by Using Linear Programming**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, G. Najarbashi, H. Habibian  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611256  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new class of entanglement witnesses (EWs) called reduction type entanglement witnesses is introduced, which can detect some multi-qudit entangeled states including PPT ones with Hilbert space of dimension $d_{_{1}}\otimes d_{_{2}}\otimes...\otimes d_{_{n}}$. The novelty of this work comes from the fact that the feasible regions turn out to be convex polygons, hence the manipulation of these EWs reduces to linear programming which can be solved \emph{exactly} by using simplex method. The decomposability and non-decomposability of these EWs are studied and it is shown that it has a close connection with eigenvalues and optimality of EWs. Also using the Jamio\l kowski isomorphism, the corresponding possible positive maps, including the generalized reduction maps of Ref. \cite{Hall1}, are obtained.

**21.    Quantum Optical Random Walk: Quantization Rules and Quantum Simulation of Asymptotics**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Smyrnakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611265  
<blockquote>
<p>
Rules for quantizing the walker+coin parts of a classical random walk are provided by treating them as interacting quantum systems. A quantum optical random walk (QORW), is introduced by means of a new rule that treats quantum or classical noise affecting the coin's state, as sources of quantization. The long term asymptotic statistics of QORW walker's position that shows enhanced diffusion rates as compared to classical case, is exactly solved. A quantum optical cavity implementation of the walk provides the framework for quantum simulation of its asymptotic statistics. The simulation utilizes interacting two-level atoms and/or laser randomly pulsating fields with fluctuating parameters.

**22.    Improving information/disturbance and estimation/distortion trade-offs with non universal protocols**  
Stefano Olivares, Matteo G. A. Paris  
J. Phys. A 40, 7945 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611272  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze in details a conditional measurement scheme based on linear optical components, feed-forward loop and homodyne detection. The scheme may be used to achieve two different tasks. On the one hand it allows the extraction of information with minimum disturbance about a set of coherent states. On the other hand, it represents a nondemolitive measurement scheme for the annihilation operator, i.e. an indirect measurement of the Q-function. We investigate the information/disturbance trade-off for state inference and introduce the estimation/distortion trade-off to assess estimation of the Q-function. For coherent states chosen from a Gaussian set we evaluate both information/disturbance and estimation/distortion trade-offs and found that non universal protocols may be optimized in order to achieve better performances than universal ones. For Fock number states we prove that universal protocols do not exist and evaluate the estimation/distortion trade-off for a thermal distribution.

**23.    A direct approach to fault-tolerance in measurement-based quantum computation via teleportation**  
Marcus Silva, Vincent Danos, Elham Kashefi, Harold Ollivier  
New J. Phys. 9 192 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611273  
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss a simple variant of the one-way quantum computing model [R. Raussendorf and H.-J. Briegel, PRL 86, 5188, 2001], called the Pauli measurement model, where measurements are restricted to be along the eigenbases of the Pauli X and Y operators, while auxiliary qubits can be prepared both in the $\ket{+_{\pi\over 4}}:={1/\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+e^{i{\pi\over 4}}\ket{1})$ state, and the usual $\ket{+}:={1/ \sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$ state. We prove the universality of this quantum computation model, and establish a standardization procedure which permits all entanglement and state preparation to be performed at the beginning of computation. This leads us to develop a direct approach to fault-tolerance by simple transformations of the entanglement graph and preparation operations, while error correction is performed naturally via syndrome-extracting teleportations.

**24.    Quantum non-demolition measurement of a superconducting two-level system**  
A. Lupascu, S. Saito, T. Picot, P. C. de Groot, C. J. P. M. Harmans, J. E. Mooij  
Nature Physics 3, 119 (2007)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611505  
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum mechanics, the process of measurement is a subtle interplay between extraction of information and disturbance of the state of the quantum system. A quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement minimizes this disturbance by using a particular system - detector interaction which preserves the eigenstates of a suitable operator of the quantum system. This leads to an ideal projective measurement. We present experiments in which we perform two consecutive measurements on a quantum two -level system, a superconducting flux qubit, by probing the hysteretic behaviour of a coupled nonlinear resonator. The large correlation between the results of the two measurements demonstrates the QND nature of the readout method. The fact that a QND measurement is possible for superconducting qubits strengthens the notion that these fabricated mesoscopic systems are to be regarded as fundamental quantum objects. Our results are also relevant for quantum information processing, where projective measurements are used for protocols like state preparation and error correction.

Nature, Vol 444, 733-736 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611561  
<blockquote>
<p>
Noise in a quantum system is fundamentally governed by the statistics and the many-body state of the underlying particles. Whereas for bosonic particles the correlated noise observed for e.g. photons or bosonic neutral atoms can still be explained within a classical field description with fluctuating phases, the anticorrelations in the detection of fermionic particles have no classical analogue. The observation of such fermionic antibunching is so far scarce and has been confined to electrons and neutrons. Here we report on the first direct observation of antibunching of neutral fermionic atoms. Through an analysis of the atomic shot noise in a set of standard absorption images, of a gas of fermionic 40K atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced correlations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped atoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to characterise the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice. Moreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental fermionic many-body quantum phases in periodic potentials, which are at the focus of current research.

This represents the extreme limit presently reached in the infrared by ICLAS with Doppler limited resolution.

**27.    Decoherence of Macroscopic States at Finite Temperatures**  
Carlos L. Benavides, Claudia M. Ojeda  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0611688  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the macroscopic superposition of light coherent states of the type Schrodinger cat states; analizying, in particular, the role of the temperature in the decoherence processes, characteristic of the superposition of macroscopic states. The method we use here is based on the Master equation formalism, introducing an original approach. We use a modified Mandel function that is well adapted to the problem. This work is motivated by the experiments proposed by S. Haroche and collaborators in the 90's. In these experiments two Rydberg atoms were sent to a cavity in which a coherent state had been previously injected, monitoring the decay of quantum states due to dissipation. We find Haroche and collaborator's result at zero temperature and we predict the behavior of the field states in the cavity at finite temperatures.
