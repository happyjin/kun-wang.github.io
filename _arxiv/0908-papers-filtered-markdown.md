**1.    Driving quantum walk spreading with the coin operator**  
Alejandro Romanelli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0019  
<blockquote>
<p>
We generalize the discrete quantum walk on the line using a time dependent unitary coin operator. We find an analytical relation between the long-time behaviors of the standard deviation and the coin operator. Selecting the coin time sequence allows to obtain a variety of predetermined asymptotic wave-function spreadings: ballistic, sub-ballistic, diffusive, sub-diffusive and localized.

**2.    Measure for the Degree of Non-Markovian Behavior of Quantum Processes in Open Systems**  
Heinz-Peter Breuer, Elsi-Mari Laine, Jyrki Piilo  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0238  
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a general measure for the degree of non-Markovian behavior in open quantum systems. This measure is based on the trace distance which quantifies the distinguishability of quantum states. It represents a functional of the dynamical map describing the time evolution of physical states, and can be interpreted in terms of the information flow between the open system and its environment. The measure takes on nonzero values whenever there is a flow of information from the environment back to the open system, which is the key feature of non-Markovian dynamics.

**3.    Error-correcting one-way quantum computation with global entangling gates**  
Jaewoo Joo, David L. Feder  
PHYSICAL REVIEW A 80, 032312 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0768  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an approach to one-way quantum computation (1WQC) that can compensate for single-qubit errors, by encoding the logical information residing on physical qubits into five-qubit error-correcting code states. A logical two-qubit cluster state that is the fundamental resource for encoded quantum teleportation is then described by a graph state containing ten vertices with constant degree seven. Universal 1WQC that incorporates error correction requires only multiple copies of this logical two-qubit state and a logical four-qubit linear cluster state, which are prepared only just in advance of their use in order to minimize the accumulation of errors. We suggest how to implement this approach in systems characterized by qubits in regular two-dimensional lattices for which entangling gates are generically global operations, such as atoms in optical lattices, quantum dots, or superconducting qubits.

**4.    Non-Markovian non-stationary completely positive open quantum system dynamics**  
Adrian A. Budini Paolo Grigolini  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 022103 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0769  
<blockquote>
<p>
By modeling the interaction of a system with an environment through a renewal approach, we demonstrate that completely positive non-Markovian dynamics may develop some unexplored non-standard statistical properties. The renewal approach is defined by a set of disruptive events, consisting in the action of a completely positive superoperator over the system density matrix. The random time intervals between events are described by an arbitrary waiting-time distribution. We show that, in contrast to the Markovian case, if one performs a system-preparation (measurement) at an arbitrary time, the subsequent evolution of the density matrix evolution is modified. The non-stationary character refers to the absence of an asymptotic master equation even when the preparation is performed at arbitrary long times. In spite of this property, we demonstrate that operator expectation values and operators correlations have the same dynamical structure, establishing the validity of a non-stationary quantum regression hypothesis. The non-stationary property of the dynamic is also analyzed through the response of the system to an external weak perturbation.

**5.    Generators of KMS Symmetric Markov Semigroups on B(h) Symmetry and Quantum Detailed Balance**  
F. Fagnola, V. Umanit√°  
Commun. Math. Phys. 298 (2), (2010), 523-547  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0967  
<blockquote>
<p>
We find the structure of generators of norm continuous quantum Markov semigroups on B(h) that are symmetric with respect to the scalar product tr(\rho^{1/2}x\rho^{1/2}y) induced by a faithful normal invariant state invariant state \rho and satisfy two quantum generalisations of the classical detailed balance condition related with this non-commutative notion of symmetry: the so-called standard detailed balance condition and the standard detailed balance condition with an antiunitary time reversal.

**6.    The speed of Markovian relaxation towards the ground state**  
Malte Vogl, Gernot Schaller, Tobias Brandes  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 012102 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1026  
<blockquote>
<p>
For sufficiently low reservoir temperatures, it is known that open quantum systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS) approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the reservoir temperature as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$. We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state. We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.

**7.    Parameter Estimation, Model Reduction and Quantum Filtering**  
Bradley A. Chase  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1200  
<blockquote>
<p>
This dissertation explores the topics of parameter estimation and model reduction in the context of quantum filtering. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a review of classical and quantum probability theory, stochastic calculus and filtering. Chapter 4 studies the problem of quantum parameter estimation and introduces the quantum particle filter as a practical computational method for parameter estimation via continuous measurement. Chapter 5 applies these techniques in magnetometry and studies the estimator's uncertainty scalings in a double-pass atomic magnetometer. Chapter 6 presents an efficient feedback controller for continuous-time quantum error correction. Chapter 7 presents an exact model of symmetric processes of collective qubit systems.

**8.    Using the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to determine parts of an array and apply a specified function to each independent part**  
Samir Lipovaca  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1262  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, we will develop a method for solving a class of problems in which we need to determine parts of an array and then apply a specified function to each independent part. Since present quantum computers are not robust enough for code writing and execution, we will build a model of a vector quantum computer that implements the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm from a machine language view using the APL2 programming language. The core of the method is an operator (DJBOX) which allows evaluation of an arbitrary function f by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Two key functions of the method are GET_PARTITION and CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS. The GET_PARTITION function determines parts of an array based on the function f. The CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS function determines parts of an array based on the function f and then applies another function to each independent part. We will imagine the method is implemented on the above vector quantum computer. We will show that the method can be successfully executed.

**9.    Matchgate and space-bounded quantum computations are equivalent**  
Richard Jozsa, Barbara Kraus, Akimasa Miyake, John Watrous  
Proc. R. Soc. A 466, 809-830 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1467  
<blockquote>
<p>
Matchgates are an especially multiflorous class of two-qubit nearest neighbour quantum gates, defined by a set of algebraic constraints. They occur for example in the theory of perfect matchings of graphs, non-interacting fermions, and one-dimensional spin chains. We show that the computational power of circuits of matchgates is equivalent to that of space-bounded quantum computation with unitary gates, with space restricted to being logarithmic in the width of the matchgate circuit. In particular, for the conventional setting of polynomial-sized (logarithmic-space generated) families of matchgate circuits, known to be classically simulatable, we characterise their power as coinciding with polynomial-time and logarithmic-space bounded universal unitary quantum computation.

**10.    Quantum random walks on the $N$-cycle subject to decoherence on the coin degree of freedom**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
Phys. Rev. E 81, 031113 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1524  
<blockquote>
<p>
For a discrete time quantum walk (QW) on the $N$-cycle, allowing for decoherence on the coin, we derive a number of new results, including an explicit formula for the position probability distribution. For a QW of this type, we show that the mixing behavior tends, in the long-run, to a uniform distribution, regardless of the initial state of the system and irrespective of the parity of the number of nodes $N$. These results confirm the findings of previous authors who arrived at similar conclusions through extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we infer that the mixing time $\bar{M(\epsilon)}$ for the time-everaged probability distribution is of order no greater than $O(N^2/\epsilon)$.

**11.    Steady-State Two Atom Entanglement in a Pumped Cavity**  
Hideomi Nihira, C. R. Stroud Jr  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1560  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we explore the possibility of a steady-state entanglement of two two-level atoms inside a pumped cavity by taking into account cavity leakage and the spontaneous emission of photons by the atoms. We describe the system in the dressed state picture in which the coherence is built into the dressed states while transitions between the dressed states are incoherent. Our model assumes the vacuum Rabi splitting of the dressed states to be much larger than any of the decay parameters of the system which allows atom-field coherence to build up before any decay process takes over. We show that, under our model, a pumping field cannot entangle two closed two-level atoms inside the cavity in the steady-state, but a steady-state entanglement can be achieved with two open two-level atoms.

**12.    Probabilistic theories with purification**  
G. Chiribella, G. M. D'Ariano, P. Perinotti  
Phys. Rev. A 81, 062348 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1583  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate general probabilistic theories in which every mixed state has a purification, unique up to reversible channels on the purifying system. We show that the purification principle is equivalent to the existence of a reversible realization of every physical process, namely that every physical process can be regarded as arising from a reversible interaction of the system with an environment, which is eventually discarded. From the purification principle we also construct an isomorphism between transformations and bipartite states that possesses all structural properties of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism in quantum mechanics. Such an isomorphism allows one to prove most of the basic features of quantum mechanics, like e.g. existence of pure bipartite states giving perfect correlations in independent experiments, no information without disturbance, no joint discrimination of all pure states, no cloning, teleportation, no programming, no bit commitment, complementarity between correctable channels and deletion channels, characterization of entanglement-breaking channels as measure-and-prepare channels, and others, without resorting to the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces.

**13.    Resonance Phenomenon Related to Spectral Singularities, Complex Barrier Potential, and Resonating Waveguides**  
Ali Mostafazadeh  
Phys.Rev.A80:032711,2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1713  
<blockquote>
<p>
A peculiar property of complex scattering potentials is the appearance of spectral singularities. These are energy eigenvalues for certain scattering states that similarly to resonance states have infinite reflection and transmission coefficients. This property reveals an interesting resonance effect with possible applications in waveguide physics. We study the spectral singularities of a complex barrier potential and explore their application in designing a waveguide that functions as a resonator. We show that for the easily accessible sizes of the waveguide and its gain region, we can realize the spectral singularity-related resonance phenomenon at almost every wavelength within the visible spectrum or outside it.

**14.    Quantum Picturalism**  
Bob Coecke  
Contemporary Physics 51, 59-83, 2010.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1787  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum mechanical formalism doesn't support our intuition, nor does it elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are subject to the laws of quantum physics. The arrays of complex numbers are kin to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice. In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory, logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict genuine quantum phenomena.

**15.    Non-Markovian Quantum Jumps in Excitonic Energy Transfer**  
Patrick Rebentrost, Rupak Chakraborty, Alan Aspuru-Guzik  
J. Chem. Phys. 131, 184102 (2009).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1961  
<blockquote>
<p>
We utilize the novel non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach to stochastically simulate exciton dynamics derived from a time-convolutionless master equation. For relevant parameters and time scales, the time-dependent, oscillatory decoherence rates can have negative regions, a signature of non-Markovian behavior and of the revival of coherences. This can lead to non-Markovian population beatings for a dimer system at room temperature. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling to low frequency modes can considerably modify transport properties. We observe increased exciton transport, which can be seen as an extension of recent environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT) concepts to the non-Markovian regime. Within the NMQJ method, the Fenna-Matthew-Olson protein is investigated as a prototype for larger photosynthetic complexes.

**18.    Average/Worst-Case Gap of Quantum Query Complexities by On-Set Size**

http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2468  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper considers the query complexity of the functions in the family F_{N,M} of N-variable Boolean functions with onset size M, i.e., the number of inputs for which the function value is 1, where 1<= M <= 2^{N}/2 is assumed without loss of generality because of the symmetry of function values, 0 and 1. Our main results are as follows: (1) There is a super-linear gap between the average-case and worst-case quantum query complexities over F_{N,M} for a certain range of M. (2) There is no super-linear gap between the average-case and worst-case randomized query complexities over F_{N,M} for every M. (3) For every M bounded by a polynomial in N, any function in F_{N,M} has quantum query complexity Theta (sqrt{N}). (4) For every M=O(2^{cN}) with an arbitrary large constant c<1, any function in F_{N,M} has randomized query complexity Omega (N).

**19.    Tight bound on coherent-state-based entanglement generation over lossy channels**  
Koji Azuma, Naoya Sota, Masato Koashi, Nobuyuki Imoto  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2735  
<blockquote>
<p>
The first stage of the hybrid quantum repeaters is entanglement generation based on transmission of pulses in coherent states over a lossy channel. Protocols to make entanglement with only one type of error are favorable for rendering subsequent entanglement distillation efficient. Here we provide the tight upper bound on performances of these protocols that is determined only by the channel loss. In addition, we show that this bound is achievable by utilizing a proposed protocol [arXiv:0811.3100] composed of a simple combination of linear optical elements and photon-number-resolving detectors.

We use a point-matching approach to numerically compute the Casimir interaction energy for a two perfect-conductor waveguide of arbitrary section. We present the method and describe the procedure used to obtain the numerical results. At first, our technique is tested for geometries with known solutions, such as concentric and eccentric cylinders. Then, we apply the point-matching technique to compute the Casimir interaction energy for new geometries such as concentric corrugated cylinders and cylinders inside conductors with focal lines.

**21.    Fault Tolerance in Parity-State Linear Optical Quantum Computing**  
A. J. F. Hayes, H. L. Haselgrove, Alexei Gilchrist, T. C. Ralph  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3932  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to calculate the noise threshold and resource requirements for a linear optical quantum computing scheme based on parity-state encoding. Parity-state encoding is used at the lowest level of code concatenation in order to efficiently correct errors arising from the inherent nondeterminism of two-qubit linear-optical gates. When combined with teleported error-correction (using either a Steane or Golay code) at higher levels of concatenation, the parity-state scheme is found to achieve a saving of approximately three orders of magnitude in resources when compared to a previous scheme, at a cost of a somewhat reduced noise threshold.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 233901 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4000  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a study of the propagation of higher-order spatial modes in a waveguided parametric down-conversion photon pair source. Observing the multimode photon pair spectrum from a periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ waveguide allowed us to isolate individual spatial modes through their distinctive spectral properties. We have measured directly the spatial distribution of each mode of the photon pairs, confirming the findings of our waveguide model, and demonstrated by coincidence measurements that the total parity of the modes is conserved in the nonlinear interaction. Furthermore, we show that we can combine the advantages of a waveguide source with the potential to generate spatially entangled photon pairs as in bulk crystal down-converters.

Physica E 42, 477 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4181  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the effects of frequent, impulsive quantum nondemolition measurements of the energy of two-level systems (TLS), alias qubits, in contact with a thermal bath. The resulting entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are found to be completely determined by the measurement rate, and unrelated to what is expected by standard thermodynamical rules that hold for Markovian baths. These anomalies allow for very fast control of heating, cooling and state-purification (entropy reduction) of qubits, much sooner than their thermal equilibration time.

We introduce a family of 2D topological subsystem quantum error-correcting codes. The gauge group is generated by 2-local Pauli operators, so that 2-local measurements are enough to recover the error syndrome. We study the computational power of code deformation in these codes, and show that boundaries cannot be introduced in the usual way. In addition, we give a general mapping connecting suitable classical statistical mechanical models to optimal error correction in subsystem stabilizer codes that suffer from depolarizing noise.

**25.    Limitations on the simulation of non-sparse Hamiltonians**  
Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari  
Quantum Information and Computation 10, 669-684 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4398  
<blockquote>
<p>
The problem of simulating sparse Hamiltonians on quantum computers is well studied. The evolution of a sparse N x N Hamiltonian H for time t can be simulated using O(||Ht||poly(log N)) operations, which is essentially optimal due to a no--fast-forwarding theorem. Here, we consider non-sparse Hamiltonians and show significant limitations on their simulation. We generalize the no--fast-forwarding theorem to dense Hamiltonians, ruling out generic simulations taking time o(||Ht||), even though ||H|| is not a unique measure of the size of a dense Hamiltonian $H$. We also present a stronger limitation ruling out the possibility of generic simulations taking time poly(||Ht||,log N), showing that known simulations based on discrete-time quantum walk cannot be dramatically improved in general. On the positive side, we show that some non-sparse Hamiltonians can be simulated efficiently, such as those with graphs of small arboricity.

**26.    Continuous-time quantum walks on semi-regular spidernet graphs via quantum probability theory**  
S. Salimi  
Quantum Inf. Process 9 (2010) 75.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4546  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze continuous-time quantum and classical random walk on spidernet lattices. In the framework of Stieltjes transform, we obtain density of states, which is an efficiency measure for the performance of classical and quantum mechanical transport processes on graphs, and calculate the spacetime transition probabilities between two vertices of the lattice. Then we analytically show that there are two power law decays $\sim t^{-3}$ and $\sim t^{-1.5}$ at the beginning of the transport for transition probability in the continuous-time quantum and classical random walk respectively. This results illustrate the decay of quantum mechanical transport processes is quicker than that of the classical one. Due to the result, the characteristic time $t_c$, which is the time when the first maximum of the probabilities occur on an infinite graph, for the quantum walk is shorter than that of the classical walk. Therefore, we can interpret that the quantum transport speed on spidernet is faster than that of the classical one. In the end, we investigate the results by numerical analysis for two examples.

**27.    Simple Error Scattering Model for improved Information Reconciliation**  
Stefan Rass  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2069  
<blockquote>
<p>
Implementations of quantum key distribution as available nowadays suffer from inefficiencies due to post processing of the raw key that severely cuts down the final secure key rate. We present a simple model for the error scattering across the raw key and derive "closed form" expressions for the probability of a parity check failure, or experiencing more than some fixed number of errors. Our results can serve for improvement for key establishment, as information reconciliation via interactive error correction and privacy amplification rests on mostly unproven assumptions. We support those hypotheses on statistical grounds.

**28.    The Complexity of Relating Quantum Channels to Master Equations**  
Toby S. Cubitt, Jens Eisert, Michael M. Wolf  
Commun. Math. Phys. 310, 383 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2128  
<blockquote>
<p>
Completely positive, trace preserving (CPT) maps and Lindblad master equations are both widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in mathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to Lindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete characterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive semi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map, is there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find it's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it is asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental observations. We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also give an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite programming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that resolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations is tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for Markovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our algorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P does equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a CPT map has a master equation description. However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for current quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales efficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master equation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case. Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related long-standing open problem in probability theory.

Eur.Phys.J.C66:295-306,2010  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3291  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor for a massless scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified dimensions. The topological parts in the expectation values are explicitly extracted and in this way the renormalization is reduced to that for the model with trivial topology. In the limit when the comoving lengths of the compact dimensions are very short compared to the Hubble length, the topological parts coincide with those for a conformal coupling and they are related to the corresponding quantities in the flat spacetime by standard conformal transformation. In the opposite limit of large comoving lengths of the compact dimensions, in dependence of the curvature coupling parameter, two regimes are realized with monotonic or oscillatory behavior of the vacuum expectation values. In the monotonic regime and for nonconformally and nonminimally coupled fields the vacuum stresses are isotropic and the equation of state for the topological parts in the energy density and pressures is of barotropic type. In the oscillatory regime, the amplitude of the oscillations for the topological part in the expectation value of the field squared can be either decreasing or increasing with time, whereas for the energy-momentum tensor the oscillations are damping.

<p>
We present exact analytical solutions for the zero-energy modes of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions fully confined within a smooth one-dimensional potential V(x)= - {\alpha}/cosh({\beta}x), which provides a good fit for potential profiles of existing top-gated graphene structures. We show that there is a threshold value of the characteristic potential strength {\alpha}/{\beta} for which the first mode appears, in striking contrast to the non-relativistic case. A simple relationship between the characteristic strength and the number of modes within the potential is found. An experimental setup is proposed for the observation of these modes. The proposed geometry could be utilized in future graphene-based devices with high on/off current ratios.
