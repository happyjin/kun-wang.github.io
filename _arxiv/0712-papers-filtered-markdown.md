**1.    Tunable resonators for quantum circuits**  
A. Palacios-Laloy, F. Nguyen, F. Mallet, P. Bertet, D. Vion, D. Esteve  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0221  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have designed, fabricated and measured high-Q $\lambda/2$ coplanar waveguide microwave resonators whose resonance frequency is made tunable with magnetic field by inserting a DC-SQUID array (including 1 or 7 SQUIDs) inside. Their tunability range is 30% of the zero field frequency. Their quality factor reaches up to 3$\times10^4$. We present a model based on thermal fluctuations that accounts for the dependance of the quality factor with magnetic field.

**2.    Mixing Times in Quantum Walks on the Hypercube**  
F.L. Marquezino, R. Portugal, G. Abal, R. Donangelo  
Phys. Rev. A 77, 042312 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0625  
<blockquote>
<p>
The mixing time of a discrete-time quantum walk on the hypercube is considered. The mean probability distribution of a Markov chain on a hypercube is known to mix to a uniform distribution in time O(n log n). We show that the mean probability distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on a hypercube mixes to a (generally non-uniform) distribution pi(x) in time O(n) and the stationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk. An explicit expression for pi(x) is derived for the particular case of a symmetric walk. These results are consistent with those obtained previously for a continuous-time quantum walk. The effect of decoherence due to randomly breaking links between connected sites in the hypercube is also considered. We find that the probability distribution mixes to the uniform distribution as expected. However, the mixing time has a minimum at a critical decoherence rate $p \approx 0.1$. A similar effect was previously reported for the QW on the N-cycle with decoherence from repeated measurements of position. A controlled amount of decoherence helps to obtain--and preserve--a uniform distribution over the $2^n$ sites of the hypercube in the shortest possible time.

**3.    Classical capacity of quantum channels with general Markovian correlated noise**  
Nilanjana Datta, Tony Dorlas  
Journal of Statistical Physics, vol. 134, nos. 5-6, pp. 1173-1195, 2009  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0722  
<blockquote>
<p>
The classical capacity of a quantum channel with arbitrary Markovian correlated noise is evaluated. For the general case of a channel with long-term memory, which corresponds to a Markov chain which does not converge to equilibrium, the capacity is expressed in terms of the communicating classes of the Markov chain. For an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain, the channel is forgetful, and one retrieves the known expression for the capacity.

**4.    Quantum Simulated Annealing**  
R. Somma, S. Boixo, H. Barnum  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1008  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a quantum algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems through quantum simulation of a classical annealing process. Our algorithm combines techniques from quantum walks, quantum phase estimation, and quantum Zeno effect. It can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the discrete-time Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of classical simulated annealing. Our implementation scales with the inverse of the square root of the minimum spectral gap of the stochastic matrix used in the classical simulation. The quantum algorithm outperforms the classical one, which scales with the inverse of the gap.

**5.    Quantum Computations: Fundamentals And Algorithms**  
Steven Duplij, Illia Shapoval  
Problems Of Atomic Science And Technology (PAST-VANT).-2007.-No.3(1).-p.230-235  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1098  
<blockquote>
<p>
Basic concepts of quantum theory of information, principles of quantum calculations and the possibility of creation on this basis unique on calculation power and functioning principle device, named quantum computer, are briefly reviewed. The main blocks of quantum logic, schemes of implementation of quantum calculations, as well as some known today effective quantum algorithms, called to realize advantages of quantum calculations upon classical, are concerned. Among them special place is taken by Shor's algorithm of number factorization, Grover's algorithm of unsorted database search and, finally, the most promising in application methods of quantum phenomena simulation, particularly quantum chaos. The most perspective methods of experimental realization of quantum computer, namely nuclear-magnetic resonance and trapped ions realizations, are discussed. Phenomena of decoherence, its influence on quantum computer stability and methods of quantum error correction are described.

**6.    Active one-way quantum computation with 2-photon 4-qubit cluster states**  
Giuseppe Vallone, Enrico Pomarico, Francesco De Martini, Paolo Mataloni  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160502 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1889  
<blockquote>
<p>
By using 2-photon 4-qubit cluster states we demonstrate deterministic one-way quantum computation in single qubit rotation algorithm. In this operation feed-forward measurements are automatically implemented by properly choosing the measurement basis of the qubits, while Pauli error corrections are realized by using two fast driven Pockels cells. We realized also a C-NOT gate for equatorial qubits and a C-Phase gate for a generic target qubit. Our results demonstrate that 2-photon cluster states can be used for rapid and efficient deterministic one-way quantum computing.

**7.    A random-coding based proof for the quantum coding theorem**  
Rochus Klesse  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2558  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a proof for the quantum channel coding theorem which relies on the fact that a randomly chosen code space typically is highly suitable for quantum error correction. In this sense, the proof is close to Shannon's original treatment of information transmission via a noisy classical channel.

**8.    Distribution of Time-Energy Entanglement over 100 km fiber using superconducting single-photon detectors**  
Qiang Zhang, Hiroki Takesue, Sae Woo Nam, Carsten Langrock, Xiuping Xie, M. M. Fejer, Yoshihisa Yamamoto  
Opt. Express. 16, 5776 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4084  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this letter, we report an experimental realization of distributing entangled photon pairs over 100 km of dispersion-shifted fiber. In the experiment, we used a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide to generate the time-energy entanglement and superconducting single-photon detectors to detect the photon pairs after 100 km. We also demonstrate that the distributed photon pairs can still be useful for quantum key distribution and other quantum communication tasks.
