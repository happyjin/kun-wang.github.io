**1.    Quantum error correction for continuously detected errors**  
Charlene Ahn, H. W. Wiseman, G. J. Milburn  
Phys. Rev. A 67, 052310 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302006  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that quantum feedback control can be used as a quantum error correction process for errors induced by weak continuous measurement. In particular, when the error model is restricted to one, perfectly measured, error channel per physical qubit, quantum feedback can act to perfectly protect a stabilizer codespace. Using the stabilizer formalism we derive an explicit scheme, involving feedback and an additional constant Hamiltonian, to protect an ($n-1$)-qubit logical state encoded in $n$ physical qubits. This works for both Poisson (jump) and white-noise (diffusion) measurement processes. In addition, universal quantum computation is possible in this scheme. As an example, we show that detected-spontaneous emission error correction with a driving Hamiltonian can greatly reduce the amount of redundancy required to protect a state from that which has been previously postulated [e.g., Alber \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4402 (2001)].

**2.    Entanglement generation in continuously coupled parametric generators**  
Jiri Herec, Jaromir Fiurasek, Ladislav Mista Jr  
J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 5, 419 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302016  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a compact source of entanglement. This device is composed of a pair of linearly coupled nonlinear waveguides operating by means of degenerate parametric downconversion. For the vacuum state at the input the generalized squeeze variance and logarithmic negativity are used to quantify the amount of nonclassicality and entanglement of output beams. Squeezing and entanglement generation for various dynamical regimes of the device are discussed.

**3.    Experimental implementation of an adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm**  
Matthias Steffen, Wim van Dam, Tad Hogg, Greg Breyta, Isaac Chuang  
Physical Review Letters, Volume 90, Number 6, Article 067903 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302057  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the realization of a nuclear magnetic resonance computer with three quantum bits that simulates an adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm. Adiabatic quantum algorithms offer new insight into how quantum resources can be used to solve hard problems. This experiment uses a particularly well suited three quantum bit molecule and was made possible by introducing a technique that encodes general instances of the given optimization problem into an easily applicable Hamiltonian. Our results indicate an optimal run time of the adiabatic algorithm that agrees well with the prediction of a simple decoherence model.

**4.    Squeezing Quantum Information through a Classical Channel: Measuring the "Quantumness" of a Set of Quantum States**  
Christopher A. Fuchs, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302092  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we propose a general method to quantify how "quantum" a set of quantum states is. The idea is to gauge the quantumness of the set by the worst-case difficulty of transmitting the states through a purely classical communication channel. Potential applications of this notion arise in quantum cryptography, where one might like to use an alphabet of states that promises to be the most sensitive to quantum eavesdropping, and in laboratory demonstrations of quantum teleportation, where it is necessary to check that quantum entanglement has actually been used in the protocol.

**5.    Non-post-selection entanglement concentration by ordinary linear optical devices**  
Wang Xiang-bin, Fan Heng  
Physical Review A 68, 060302(R), (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302105  
<blockquote>
<p>
Two remote parties, Alice and Bob initially share some non-maximally entangled states. Through the entanglement concentration by local operation and classical communication(LOCC), they may obtain an outcome of maximally entangled states in the price of decreasing the number of pairs shared by them. Recently, entanglement concentration have been experimently demonstrated by post-selection (T. Yamamoto et al, Nature, 421, 343(2003) and Z. Zhao et al, quant-ph/0301118). Here we give a modified scheme which can be used for the entanglement concentration without any post selection by using only practically existing linear optical devices. In particular, a sophisticated photon detector to distinguish one photon or two photons is not required. Our scheme can be used to really produce the event-ready maximally entangled pairs through LOCC provided that the requested raw pairs are supplied deterministically. A detailed experimental plan with spontaneous parametric down conversion(SPDC) is shown.

**6.    The Quantumness of a Set of Quantum States**  
Christopher A. Fuchs, Masahide Sasaki  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302108  
<blockquote>
<p>
This article is an introduction to quant-ph/0302092. We propose to quantify how "quantum" a set of quantum states is. The quantumness of a set is the worst-case difficulty of transmitting the states through a classical communication channel. Potential applications of this measure arise in quantum cryptography, where one might like to use an alphabet of states most sensitive to quantum eavesdropping, and in lab demonstrations of quantum teleportation, where it is necessary to check that entanglement has indeed been used.

**7.    Applications of Coherent Population Transfer to Quantum Information Processing**  
R. G.Beausoleil, W. J. Munro, T. P. Spiller  
Topic Review in JMO 51, 1559-1601 (2004)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302109  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a theoretical framework for the exploration of quantum mechanical coherent population transfer phenomena, with the ultimate goal of constructing faithful models of devices for classical and quantum information processing applications. We begin by outlining a general formalism for weak-field quantum optics in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture, and we include a general phenomenological representation of Lindblad decoherence mechanisms. We use this formalism to describe the interaction of a single stationary multilevel atom with one or more propagating classical or quantum laser fields, and we describe in detail several manifestations and applications of electromagnetically induced transparency. In addition to providing a clear description of the nonlinear optical characteristics of electromagnetically transparent systems that lead to ``ultraslow light,'' we verify that -- in principle -- a multi-particle atomic or molecular system could be used as either a low power optical switch or a quantum phase shifter. However, we demonstrate that the presence of significant dephasing effects destroys the induced transparency, and that increasing the number of particles weakly interacting with the probe field only reduces the nonlinearity further. Finally, a detailed calculation of the relative quantum phase induced by a system of atoms on a superposition of spatially distinct Fock states predicts that a significant quasi-Kerr nonlinearity and a low entropy cannot be simultaneously achieved in the presence of arbitrary spontaneous emission rates. Within our model, we identify the constraints that need to be met for this system to act as a one-qubit and a two-qubit conditional phase gate.

**8.    Classical and quantum communication without a shared reference frame**  
Stephen D. Bartlett, Terry Rudolph, R. W. Spekkens  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 027901 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302111  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that communication without a shared reference frame is possible using entangled states. Both classical and quantum information can be communicated with perfect fidelity without a shared reference frame at a rate that asymptotically approaches one classical bit or one encoded qubit per transmitted qubit. We present an optical scheme to communicate classical bits without a shared reference frame using entangled photon pairs and linear optical Bell state measurements.

**9.    Notes on Hallgren's efficient quantum algorithm for solving Pell's equation**  
Richard Jozsa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302134  
<blockquote>
<p>
Pell's equation is x^2-d*y^2=1 where d is a square-free integer and we seek positive integer solutions x,y>0. Let (x',y') be the smallest solution (i.e. having smallest A=x'+y'sqrt(d)). Lagrange showed that every solution can easily be constructed from A so given d it suffices to compute A. It is known that A can be exponentially large in d so just to write down A we need exponential time in the input size log d. Hence we introduce the regulator R=ln A and ask for the value of R to n decimal places. The best known classical algorithm has sub-exponential running time O(exp(sqrt(log d)), poly(n)). Hallgren's quantum algorithm gives the result in polynomial time O(poly(log d),poly(n)) with probability 1/poly(log d). The idea of the algorithm falls into two parts: using the formalism of algebraic number theory we convert the problem of solving Pell's equation into the problem of determining R as the period of a function on the real numbers. Then we generalise the quantum Fourier transform period finding algorithm to work in this situation of an irrational period on the (not finitely generated) abelian group of real numbers. These notes are intended to be accessible to a reader having no prior acquaintance with algebraic number theory; we give a self contained account of all the necessary concepts and we give elementary proofs of all the results needed. Then we go on to describe Hallgren's generalisation of the quantum period finding algorithm, which provides the efficient computational solution of Pell's equation in the above sense.

**10.    Quantum circuit implementation of the Hamiltonian versions of Grover's algorithm**  
J. Roland, N. J. Cerf  
Phys. Rev. A 68, 062311 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302138  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze three different quantum search algorithms, the traditional Grover's algorithm, its continuous-time analogue by Hamiltonian evolution, and finally the quantum search by local adiabatic evolution. We show that they are closely related algorithms in the sense that they all perform a rotation, at a constant angular velocity, from a uniform superposition of all states to the solution state. This make it possible to implement the last two algorithms by Hamiltonian evolution on a conventional quantum circuit, while keeping the quadratic speedup of Grover's original algorithm.

**11.    New features of the thermal Casimir force at small separations**  
F. Chen, G.L. Klimchitskaya, U. Mohideen, V.M. Mostepanenko  
Phys. Rev. Lett., v.90, N16, p.160404-(1-4), 2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302149  
<blockquote>
<p>
The difference of the thermal Casimir forces at different temperatures between real metals is shown to increase with a decrease of the separation distance. This opens new opportunities for the demonstration of the thermal dependence of the Casimir force. Both configurations of two parallel plates and a sphere above a plate are considered. Different approaches to the theoretical description of the thermal Casimir force are shown to lead to different measurable predictions.

**12.    Quantum walks based on an interferometric analogy**  
Mark Hillery, Janos Bergou, Edgar Feldman  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302161  
<blockquote>
<p>
There are presently two models for quantum walks on graphs. The "coined" walk uses discrete time steps, and contains, besides the particle making the walk, a second quantum system, the coin, that determines the direction in which the particle will move. The continuous walk operates with continuous time. Here a third model for a quantum walk is proposed, which is based on an analogy to optical interferometers. It is a discrete-time model, and the unitary operator that advances the walk one step depends only on the local structure of the graph on which the walk is taking place. No quantum coin is introduced. This type of walk allows us to introduce elements, such as phase shifters, that have no counterpart in classical random walks. Walks on the line and cycle are discussed in some detail, and a probability current for these walks is introduced. The relation to the coined quantum walk is also discussed. The paper concludes by showing how to define these walks for a general graph.

**13.    Probing Planck-scale Physics with Extragalactic Sources?**  
Y. Jack Ng, W. A. Christiansen, H. van Dam  
Astrophys.J.591:L87-L90,2003  
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302372  
<blockquote>
<p>
At Planck-scale, spacetime is "foamy" due to quantum fluctuations predicted by quantum gravity. Here we consider the possibility of using spacetime foam-induced phase incoherence of light from distant galaxies and gamma-ray bursters to probe Planck-scale physics. In particular, we examine the cumulative effects of spacetime fluctuations over a huge distance. Our analysis shows that they are far below what is required in this approach to shed light on the foaminess of spacetime.

**14.    Cryptographic Randomized Response Techniques**  
Andris Ambainis, Markus Jakobsson, Helger Lipmaa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0302025  
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop cryptographically secure techniques to guarantee unconditional privacy for respondents to polls. Our constructions are efficient and practical, and are shown not to allow cheating respondents to affect the ``tally'' by more than their own vote -- which will be given the exact same weight as that of other respondents. We demonstrate solutions to this problem based on both traditional cryptographic techniques and quantum cryptography.
