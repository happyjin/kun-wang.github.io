**1.    Mutually unbiased bases for quantum states defined over p-adic numbers**  
Wim van Dam, Alexander Russell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0060  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) for quantum states defined over the p-adic numbers Q_p, i.e. the states that can be described as elements of the (rigged) Hilbert space L2(Q_p). We find that for every prime p>2 there are at least p+1 MUBs, which is in contrast with the situation for quantum states defined over the real line R for which only 3 MUBs are known. We comment on the possible reason for the difference regarding MUBs between these two infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.

**2.    Spatially dependent decoherence and anomalous diffussion of quantum walks**  
A. Perez, A. Romanelli  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0122  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the long time behavior of a discrete time quantum walk subject to decoherence with a strong spatial dependence, acting on one half of the lattice. We show that, except for limiting cases on the decoherence parameter, the quantum walk at late times behaves sub-ballistically, meaning that the characteristic features of the quantum walk are not completely spoiled. Contrarily to expectations, the asymptotic behavior is non Markovian, and depends on the amount of decoherence. This feature can be clearly shown on the long time value of the Generalized Chiral Distribution (GCD).

**3.    Non-Markovian effects on non-locality of a qubit-oscillator system**  
Jie Li, Gerard McKeown, Fernando L. Semiao, Mauro Paternostro  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 022116 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0133  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian evolutions are responsible for a wide variety of physically interesting effects. Here, we study non-locality of the non-classical state of a system consisting of a qubit and an oscillator exposed to the effects of non-Markovian evolutions. We find that the different facets of non-Markovianity affect non-locality in different and non-obvious ways: ranging from pronounced insensitivity of the Bell function to quite a spectacular evidence of information kick-back.

**4.    Quantifying non-Markovianity of continuous variable Gaussian dynamical maps**  
Ruggero Vasile, Sabrina Maniscalco, Matteo G. A. Paris, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Jyrki Piilo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0242  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a non-Markovianity measure for continuous variable open quantum systems based on the idea put forward in H.-P. Breuer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\textbf{103}, 210401 (2009), i.e., by quantifying the flow of information from the environment back to the open system. Instead of the trace distance we use here the fidelity to assess distinguishability of quantum states. We employ our measure to evaluate non-Markovianity of two paradigmatic Gaussian channels: the purely damping channel and the quantum Brownian motion channel with Ohmic environment. We consider different classes of Gaussian states and look for pairs of states maximizing the backflow of information. For coherent states we find simple analytical solutions, whereas for squeezed states we provide both exact numerical and approximate analytical solutions in the weak coupling limit.

**5.    Arrays of waveguide-coupled optical cavities that interact strongly with atoms**  
G. Lepert, M. Trupke, M. J. Hartmann, M. B. Plenio, E. A. Hinds  
New J. Phys. 13 113002 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0886  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a realistic scheme for coupling atoms or other quantum emitters with an array of coupled optical cavities. We consider open Fabry-Perot microcavities coupled to the emitters. Our central innovation is to connect the microcavities to waveguide resonators, which are in turn evanescently coupled to each other on a photonic chip to form a coupled cavity chain. In this paper, we describe the components, their technical limitations and the factors that need to be determined experimentally. This provides the basis for a detailed theoretical analysis of two possible experiments to realize quantum squeezing and controlled quantum dynamics. We close with an outline of more advanced applications.

**6.    Improved Data Post-Processing in Quantum Key Distribution and Application to Loss Thresholds in Device Independent QKD**  
Xiongfeng Ma, Norbert LÃ¼tkenhaus  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 12, No. 3&4 (2012) 0203-0214  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1203  
<blockquote>
<p>
Security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) often require post-processing schemes to simplify the data structure, and hence the security proof. We show a generic method to improve resulting secure key rates by partially reversing the simplifying post-processing for error correction purposes. We apply our method to the security analysis of device-independent QKD schemes and of detection-device-independent QKD schemes, where in both cases one is typically required to assign binary values even to lost signals. In the device-independent case, the loss tolerance threshold is cut down by our method from 92.4% to 90.9%.The lowest tolerable transmittance of the detector-device-independent scheme can be improved from 78.0% to 65.9%.

**7.    Dynamics of interacting qubits coupled to a common bath: Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion approach**  
Xinyu Zhao, Jun Jing, Brittany Corn, Ting Yu  
Phys Rev A. 84, 032101 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1239  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian dynamics is studied for two interacting quibts strongly coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. For the first time, we have derived the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation for the coupled two-qubit system without any approximations, and in particular, without the Markov approximation. As an application and illustration of our derived time-local QSD equation, we investigate the temporal behavior of quantum coherence dynamics. In particular, we find a strongly non-Markovian regime where entanglement generation is significantly modulated by the environmental memory. Additionally, we studied the residual entanglement in the steady state by analyzing the steady state solution of the QSD equation. Finally, we have discussed an approximate QSD equation.

**8.    Non-Markovian quantum trajectories, instruments and time-continuous measurements**  
Sven Kr?nke, Walter T. Strunz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1338  
<blockquote>
<p>
The linear and the nonlinear non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equation (NMQSD) are well known tools for the description of certain non-Markovian open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically investigate whether the normalized linear NMQSD or the nonlinear NMQSD solutions can be generated by means of a time-continuous measurement. By considering any conceivable measurement scheme in the framework of instruments, we derive a necessary criterion for a measurement interpretation of both equations. Concrete examples show that the normalized linear NMQSD solutions are realizable only in the Markovian limit in general. The application of the presented criterion to the nonlinear NMQSD remains an open issue.

**9.    A Linear-Optical Proof that the Permanent is #P-Hard**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1674  
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the crown jewels of complexity theory is Valiant's 1979 theorem that computing the permanent of an n*n matrix is #P-hard. Here we show that, by using the model of linear-optical quantum computing---and in particular, a universality theorem due to Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn---one can give a different and arguably more intuitive proof of this theorem.

**10.    Encoding an Arbitrary State in a [7,1,3] Quantum Error Correction Code**  
Sidney D. Buchbinder, Channing L. Huang, Yaakov S. Weinstein  
Quantum Information Processing 12, 699 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1714  
<blockquote>
<p>
We calculate the fidelity with which an arbitrary state can be encoded into a [7,1,3] CSS quantum error correction code in a non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment with the goal of determining whether this encoding can be used for practical implementations of quantum computation. This determination is accomplished by applying ideal error correction to the encoded state which demonstrates the correctability of errors that occurred during the encoding process. We then apply single-qubit Clifford gates to the encoded state and determine the accuracy with which these gates can be applied. Finally, fault tolerant noisy error correction is applied to the encoded states in the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment allowing us to compare noisy (realistic) and perfect error correction implementations. We note that this maintains the fidelity of the encoded state for certain error-probability values. These results have implications for when non-fault tolerant procedures may be used in practical quantum computation and whether quantum error correction should be applied at every step in a quantum protocol.

**11.    Quantum Walks on the Line with Phase Parameters**  
Marcos Villagra, Masaki Nakanishi, Shigeru Yamashita, Yasuhiko Nakashima  
IEICE Trans. Inf. & Syst., Vol. E95.D, No. 3, pp.722-730, 2012  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1866  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, a study on discrete-time coined quantum walks on the line is presented. Clear mathematical foundations are still lacking for this quantum walk model. As a step towards this objective, the following question is being addressed: {\it Given a graph, what is the probability that a quantum walk arrives at a given vertex after some number of steps?} This is a very natural question, and for random walks it can be answered by several different combinatorial arguments. For quantum walks this is a highly non-trivial task. Furthermore, this was only achieved before for one specific coin operator (Hadamard operator) for walks on the line. Even considering only walks on lines, generalizing these computations to a general SU(2) coin operator is a complex task. The main contribution is a closed-form formula for the amplitudes of the state of the walk (which includes the question above) for a general symmetric SU(2) operator for walks on the line. To this end, a coin operator with parameters that alters the phase of the state of the walk is defined. Then, closed-form solutions are computed by means of Fourier analysis and asymptotic approximation methods. We also present some basic properties of the walk which can be deducted using weak convergence theorems for quantum walks. In particular, the support of the induced probability distribution of the walk is calculated. Then, it is shown how changing the parameters in the coin operator affects the resulting probability distribution.

**12.    Hermitian scattering behavior for the non-Hermitian scattering center**  
L. Jin, Z. Song  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 012111 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2187  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the scattering problem for the non-Hermitian scattering center, which consists of two Hermitian clusters with anti-Hermitian couplings between them. Counterintuitively, it is shown that it acts as a Hermitian scattering center, satisfying $|r| ^{2}+|t| ^{2}=1$, i.e., the Dirac probability current is conserved, when one of two clusters is embedded in the waveguides. This conclusion can be applied to an arbitrary parity-symmetric real Hermitian graph with additional PT-symmetric potentials, which is more feasible in experiment. Exactly solvable model is presented to illustrate the theory. Bethe ansatz solution indicates that the transmission spectrum of such a cluster displays peculiar feature arising from the non-Hermiticity of the scattering center.

Jian-Shun Tang, Chuan-Feng Li, Yu-Long Li, Xu-Bo Zou, Guang-Can Guo, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Elsi-Mari Laine, Jyrki Piilo  
EPL 97, 10002 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2438  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian processes have recently become a central topic in the study of open quantum systems. We realize experimentally non-Markovian decoherence processes of single photons by combining time delay and evolution in a polarization-maintaining optical fiber. The experiment allows the identification of the process with strongest memory effects as well as the determination of a recently proposed measure for the degree of quantum non-Markovianity based on the exchange of information between the open system and its environment. Our results show that an experimental quantification of memory in quantum processes is indeed feasible which could be useful in the development of quantum memory and communication devices.

**14.    Inherent Mach-Zehnder interference with "which-way" detection for single particle scattering in one dimension**  
Lan Zhou, Yue Chang, H. Dong, Le-Man Kuang, C. P. Sun  
Phys. Rev. A 85, 013806 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2470  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the coherent transport of single photon in a one-dimensional coupled-resonator-array, "non-locally" coupled to a two-level system. Since its inherent structure is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we explain the destructive interference phenomenon of the transmission spectrums according to the effect of which-way detection. The quantum realization of the present model is a nano-electromechanical resonator arrays with two nearest resonators coupled to a single spin via their attached magnetic tips. Its classical simulation is a waveguide of coupled defected cavity array with double couplings to a side defected cavity.

**15.    The Heun differential equation and the Gauss differential equation related to quantum walks**  
Norio Konno, Takuya Machida, Tohru Wakasa  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2662  
<blockquote>
<p>
The limit theorems of discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks on the line have been intensively studied. We show a relation among limit distributions of quantum walks, Heun differential equations and Gauss differential equations. Indeed, we derive the second-order Fucksian differential equations which limit density functions of quantum walks satisfy. Moreover, using both differential equations, we discuss a relationship between discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks. Taking suitable limit, we can transform a Heun equation obtained from the limit density function of the discrete-time quantum walk to a Gauss equation given by that of the continuous-time quantum walk.

**16.    Experimental control of the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems**  
Bi-Heng Liu, Li Li, Yun-Feng Huang, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Elsi-Mari Laine, Heinz-Peter Breuer, Jyrki Piilo  
Nature Physics 7, 931-934 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2677  
<blockquote>
<p>
Realistic quantum mechanical systems are always exposed to an external environment. The presence of the environment often gives rise to a Markovian process in which the system loses information to its surroundings. However, many quantum systems exhibit a pronounced non-Markovian behavior in which there is a flow of information from the environment back to the system, signifying the presence of quantum memory effects [1-5]. The environment is usually composed of a large number of degrees of freedom which are difficult to control, but some sophisticated schemes for modifying the environment have been developed [6]. The physical realization and control of dynamical processes in open quantum systems plays a decisive role, for example, in recent proposals for the generation of entangled states [7-9], for schemes of dissipative quantum computation [10], for the design of quantum memories [11] and for the enhancement of the efficiency in quantum metrology [12]. Here we report an experiment which allows through selective preparation of the initial environmental states to drive the open system from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, to control the information flow between the system and the environment, and to determine the degree of non-Markovianity by direct measurements on the open system.

Appl. Phys. Lett. 100, 233704 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3128  
<blockquote>
<p>
Optical interferometry is amongst the most sensitive techniques for precision measurement. By increasing the light intensity a more precise measurement can usually be made. However, in some applications the sample is light sensitive. By using entangled states of light the same precision can be achieved with less exposure of the sample. This concept has been demonstrated in measurements of fixed, known optical components. Here we use two-photon entangled states to measure the concentration of the blood protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) in an aqueous buffer solution. We use an opto-fluidic device that couples a waveguide interferometer with a microfluidic channel. These results point the way to practical applications of quantum metrology to light sensitive samples.

We give new arguments in support of \emph{signed quantum key establishment}, where quantum cryptography is used in a public-key infrastructure that provides the required authentication. We also analyze more thoroughly than previous works the benefits that quantum key establishment protocols have over certain classical protocols, motivated in part by the various objections to quantum key establishment that are sometimes raised. Previous knowledge of quantum cryptography on the reader's part is not required for this article, as the definition of "quantum key establishment" that we use is an entirely classical and black-box characterization (one need only trust that protocols satisfying the definition exist).

**19.    Establishing spin-network topologies by repeated projective measurements**  
Christian O. Bretschneider, Gonzalo A. Alvarez, Gershon Kurizki, Lucio Frydman  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 140403 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3796  
<blockquote>
<p>
It has been recently shown that in quantum systems, the complex time evolution typical of many-bodied coupled networks can be transformed into a simple, relaxation-like dynamics, by relying on periodic dephasings of the off-diagonal density matrix elements. This represents a case of "quantum Zeno effects", where unitary evolutions are inhibited by projective measurements. We present here a novel exploitation of these effects, by showing that a relaxation-like behaviour is endowed to the polarization transfers occurring within a N-spin coupled network. Experimental implementations and coupling constant determinations for complex spin-coupling topologies, are thus demonstrated within the field of liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

**20.    Spin-guides and spin-splitters: Waveguide analogies in one-dimensional spin chains**  
Melissa I. Makin, Jared H. Cole, Charles D. Hill, Andrew D. Greentree  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4456  
<blockquote>
<p>
Here we show a direct mapping between waveguide theory and spin chain transport, opening an alternative approach to quantum information transport in the solid-state. By applying temporally varying control profiles to a spin chain, we design a virtual waveguide or 'spin-guide' to conduct individual spin excitations along defined space-time trajectories of the chain. We explicitly show that the concepts of confinement, adiabatic bend loss and beamsplitting can be mapped from optical waveguide theory to spin-guides (and hence 'spin-splitters'). Importantly, the spatial scale of applied control pulses is required to be large compared to the inter-spin spacing, and thereby allowing the design of scalable control architectures.

<p>
We present a general methodology to obtain the basis of qudits which are admissible to Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). We first study this method for qubits to characterize the ensemble that works for the Hadamard transformation (QFT for two dimension). In this regard we identify certain incompleteness in the result of Maitra and Parashar (IJQI, 2006). Next we characterize the ensemble of qutrits for which QFT is possible. Further, some theoretical results related to higher dimensions are also discussed.

**22.    Experimental quantum error correction with high fidelity**  
Jingfu Zhang, Dorian Gangloff, Osama Moussa, Raymond Laflamme  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4821  
<blockquote>
<p>
More than ten years ago a first step towards quantum error correction (QEC) was implemented [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2152 (1998)]. The work showed there was sufficient control in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to implement QEC, and demonstrated that the error rate changed from $\epsilon$ to approximatively $\sim\epsilon^2$. In the current work we reproduce a similar experiment using control techniques that have been since developed, such as GRAPE pulses. We show that the fidelity of the QEC gate sequence, and the comparative advantage of QEC are appreciably improved. This advantage is maintained despite the errors introduced by the additional operations needed to protect the quantum states.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4871  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate that single-photon as well as biphoton revivals are possible in a new class of dynamic optical systems-the so-called Glauber-Fock oscillator lattices. In these arrays, both Bloch-like oscillations and dynamic delocalization can occur which can be described in closed form. The bunching and anti-bunching response of path-entangled photons can be pre-engineered in such coupled optical arrangements and the possibility of emulating Fermionic behavior in this family of lattices is also considered. We elucidate these effects via pertinent examples and we discuss the prospect of experimentally observing these quantum interactions.

M. D. Reed, L. DiCarlo, S. E. Nigg, L. Sun, L. Frunzio, S. M. Girvin, R. J. Schoelkopf  
Nature 482, 382-385 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4948  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems exponentially faster than possible classically but are challenging to build because of their increased susceptibility to errors. Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting codes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code used [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by encoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all three qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or Toffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit, in 63 ns. We find 85\pm1% fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate and 78\pm1% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction with 76\pm0.5% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. When combined with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times [5,6], this may lead to scalable quantum technology.

**26.    Coherent destruction of tunneling in a lattice array under selective in-phase modulations**  
Xiaobing Luo, Jiahao Huang, Chaohong Lee  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 053847 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5622  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) in a lattice array under selective in-phase harmonic modulations, in which some selected lattice sites are driven by in-phase harmonic oscillating fields and other lattice sites are undriven. Due to the occurrence of CDT, if the driving amplitude $A$ and the driving frequency $\omega$ are tuned to satisfy the zeroth-order Bessel function $J_0(A/\omega)=0$, the driven lattice sites are approximately decoupled with the undriven lattice sites. The CDT even takes place in lattice systems with high-order couplings between non-nearest lattice sites. By using the CDT, we propose a scheme for realizing directed transport of a single particle. It is possible to observe the CDT in the engineered optical waveguide array, which provides a new opportunity for controlling light propagation and designing switch-like couplers.

**27.    Specific heat anomalies of small quantum systems subjected to finite baths**  
Hideo Hasegawa  
J. Math. Phys. 52 (2011) 123301  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0108  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied the specific heat of the $(N_S+N_B)$ model for an $N_S$-body harmonic oscillator (HO) system which is strongly coupled to an $N_B$-body HO bath without dissipation. The system specific heat of $C_S(T)$ becomes $N_S k_B$ at $T \rightarrow \infty$ and vanishes at $T = 0$ in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics. The calculated $C_S(T)$ at low temperatures is not proportional to $N_S$ and shows an anomalous temperature dependence, strongly depending on $N_S$, $N_B$ and the system-bath coupling. In particular at very low (but finite) temperatures, it may become {\it negative} for a strong system-bath coupling, which is in contrast with {\it non-negative} specific heat of an HO system with $N_S=1$ reported by G-L. Ingold, P. H\"{a}nggi and P. Talkner [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 79}, 061105 (2005)]. Our calculation indicates an importance of taking account of finite $N_S$ in studying open quantum systems which may include an arbitrary number of particles in general.

We report on the controlled insertion of individual Cs atoms into an ultracold Rb gas at about 400 nK.

In our approach, both systems are prepared in separated traps and then combined. Our results pave the way for coherent interaction between a quantum gas and a single or few neutral atoms of another species.

We test our quantum machine by executing codes that involve seven quantum elements: Two superconducting qubits coupled through a quantum bus, two quantum memories, and two zeroing registers. Two vital algorithms for quantum computing are demonstrated, the quantum Fourier transform, with 66% process fidelity, and the three-qubit Toffoli OR phase gate, with 98% phase fidelity. Our results, in combination especially with longer qubit coherence, illustrate a potentially viable approach to factoring numbers and implementing simple quantum error correction codes.

Systems of photonic crystal cavities coupled to quantum dots are a promising architecture for quantum networking and quantum simulators. The ability to independently tune the frequencies of laterally separated quantum dots is a crucial component of such a scheme. Here, we demonstrate independent tuning of laterally separated quantum dots in photonic crystal cavities coupled by in-plane waveguides by implanting lines of protons which serve to electrically isolate different sections of a diode structure.

Inertial sensors relying on atom interferometry offer a breakthrough advance in a variety of applications, such as inertial navigation, gravimetry or ground- and space-based tests of fundamental physics. These instruments require a quiet environment to reach their performance and using them outside the laboratory remains a challenge. Here we report the first operation of an airborne matter-wave accelerometer set up aboard a 0g plane and operating during the standard gravity (1g) and microgravity (0g) phases of the flight. At 1g, the sensor can detect inertial effects more than 300 times weaker than the typical acceleration fluctuations of the aircraft. We describe the improvement of the interferometer sensitivity in 0g, which reaches 2 x 10-4 ms-2 / \surdHz with our current setup. We finally discuss the extension of our method to airborne and spaceborne tests of the Universality of free fall with matter waves.

<p>
To advance hierarchial equations of motion as a standard theory for quantum dissipative dynamics, we put forward a mixed Heisenberg--Schrodinger scheme with block-matrix implementation on efficient evaluation of nonlinear optical response function. The new approach is also integrated with optimized hierarchical theory and numerical filtering algorithm. Different configurations of coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy of model excitonic dimer systems are investigated, with focus on the effects of intermolecular transfer coupling and bi-exciton interaction.

We study the parameter dependence of the internal structure of resonance states by formulating Complex two-dimensional (2D) Matrix Model, where the two dimensions represent two-levels of resonances. We calculate a critical value of the parameter at which "nature transition" with character exchange occurs between two resonance states, from the viewpoint of geometry on complex-parameter space. Such critical value is useful to know the internal structure of resonance states with variation of the parameter in the system. We apply the model to analyze the internal structure of hadrons with variation of the color number Nc from infinity to a realistic value 3. By regarding 1/Nc as the variable parameter in our model, we calculate a critical color number of nature transition between hadronic states in terms of quark-antiquark pair and mesonic molecule as exotics from the geometry on complex-Nc plane. For the large-Nc effective theory, we employ the chiral Lagrangian induced by holographic QCD with D4/D8/D8-bar multi-D brane system in the type IIA superstring theory.
