**1.    Implementation of Quantum and Classical Discrete Fractional Fourier Transforms**

<blockquote>
<p>
Fourier transforms are ubiquitous mathematical tools in basic and applied sciences. We here report classical and quantum optical realizations of the discrete fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform. In the integrated configuration used in our experiments, the order of the transform is mapped onto the longitudinal coordinate, thus opening up the prospect of simultaneously observing all Transformation orders. In the context of classical optics, we implement discrete fractional Fourier transforms, both integer and fractional, of exemplary wave functions and experimentally demonstrate the shift theorem. Moreover, we apply this approach in the quantum realm to transform separable and highly entangled biphoton wave functions. The proposed approach is versatile and could find applications in various fields where Fourier transforms are essential tools, such as quantum chemistry and biology, physics and mathematics.

**2.    Quantum Walks and Gauge Fields in Discrete Space-Time**  
Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00038  
<blockquote>
<p>
The connection between gauge fields and Discrete Time Quantum Walks (DTQWs) is revisited on a new family of (1 + 2)-dimensional walks whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and by constructing a gauge-invariant discrete electromagnetic field. Numerical simulations outside the scope of the continuous limit confirm the existence of phenomena typical of the electromagnetic coupling, such as Bloch oscillations and the $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift. Applications to quantum simulations and quantum algorithmics are discussed.

**3.    Recursive quantum spatial search does not need ancilla qubit**  
Avatar Tulsi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00207  
<blockquote>
<p>
Spatial search is a widely studied application of quantum algorithms. Several algorithms have been proposed for spatial search without using ancilla qubits which are easier to implement physically. All such algorithms are based on the widely studied quantum walk approach. Here we consider another approach by Aaronson and Ambainis based on the recursive application of Grover's algorithm rather than quantum walks. Their algorithm needs one ancilla qubit for successful implementation. We present a different recursive algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubit and hence it offers physical implementation advantages.

**4.    Accurate and precise characterization of linear optical interferometers**  
Ish Dhand, Abdullah Khalid, He Lu, Barry C. Sanders  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00283  
<blockquote>
<p>
We combine single- and two-photon interference procedures for characterizing any multi-port linear optical interferometer accurately and precisely. Accuracy is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced precision is attained by curve fitting to measured quantities based on a Poissonian shot noise assumption, and we employ bootstrapping statistics to quantify the resultant degree of precision. A scattershot approach is devised to effect a reduction in the experimental time required to characterize the interferometer.

**5.    Blueprint for a microwave ion trap quantum computer**

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00420  
<blockquote>
<p>
A universal quantum computer will have fundamental impact on a vast number of research fields and technologies. Therefore an increasingly large scientific and industrial community is working towards the realization of such a device. A large scale quantum computer is best constructed using a modular approach. We present the blueprint for an ion trap based scalable quantum computer module which makes it possible to create an arbitrarily large quantum computer architecture powered by long-wavelength radiation. This quantum computer module controls all operations as a stand-alone unit, is constructed using silicon microfabrication techniques and within reach of current technology. To perform the required quantum computations, the module makes use of long-wavelength-radiation quantum gate technology and relies only on a vacuum environment and global laser and microwave fields. To scale this microwave quantum computer architecture beyond one module we also present a new approach that makes use of ion transport between different modules, thereby allowing connections between arbitrarily many modules for a large scale architecture. A high-error-threshold surface error correction code making use of such module interactions can be implemented in the proposed architecture to execute fault-tolerant quantum logic operations. With only minor adjustments these modules are also suitable for alternative ion trap quantum computer architectures, such as schemes using photonic interconnects.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00782  
<blockquote>
<p>
The identification of phenomena able to pinpoint quantum interference is attracting large interest. Indeed, a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an important leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical applications, such as certification of photonic quantum devices, whose computational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle interference. Quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many particles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the Fourier transformation in the Fock space. In this work we develop a scalable approach for the implementation of quantum fast Fourier transform using 3-D photonic integrated interferometers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique. We observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4- and 8-mode optical circuits: the experimental results demonstrate genuine quantum interference between the injected photons, thus offering a powerful tool for diagnostic of photonic platforms.

**7.    Hyperentanglement-enhanced Weak Value Amplification with High-Order Correlation Function**  
Jing-Zheng Huang, Qin-Zheng Li, Chen Fang, Gui-Hua Zeng  
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 48 (2015) 195501  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01268  
<blockquote>
<p>
By exploiting the hyperentanglement, we propose a new concrete scheme to realize weak value amplification, which can be implemented by N hyperentangled photons along with coincidence detection. Our scheme can optimally increase the amplification factor by a factor of N compared to the usage of N uncorrelated photons, and achieve the Heisenberg limit for the purpose of parameter estimation. We expect our study can inspire a further investigation on the usage of hyperentanglement in weak measurement and quantum metrology.

**8.    Spatial search by quantum walk is optimal for almost all graphs**  
Shantanav Chakraborty, Leonardo Novo, Andris Ambainis, Yasser Omar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01327  
<blockquote>
<p>
Finding a given node in a network exploiting the speed-up offered by quantum search was only known to hold for a handful of specific graphs. In this work, we prove that for Erd\"os-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\ graphs of $n$ vertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by continuous time quantum walk is \textit{almost surely} optimal as long as $p\geq \log^{3/2}(n)/n$. Consequently, we prove that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for \emph{almost all} graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices for which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish high fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random network of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as well as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks typically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered structures.

**9.    Repeated quantum error correction on a continuously encoded qubit by real-time feedback**  
Julia Cramer, Norbert Kalb, M. Adriaan Rol, Bas Hensen, Machiel S. Blok, Matthew Markham, Daniel J. Twitchen, Ronald Hanson, Tim H. Taminiau  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01388  
<blockquote>
<p>
Reliable quantum information processing in the face of errors is a major fundamental and technological challenge. Quantum error correction protects quantum states by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) in multiple physical qubits, so that errors can be detected without affecting the encoded state. To be compatible with universal fault-tolerant computations, it is essential that the states remain encoded at all times and that errors are actively corrected. Here we demonstrate such active error correction on a continuously protected qubit using a diamond quantum processor. We encode a logical qubit in three long-lived nuclear spins, repeatedly detect phase errors by non-destructive measurements using an ancilla electron spin, and apply corrections on the encoded state by real-time feedback. The actively error-corrected qubit is robust against errors and multiple rounds of error correction prevent errors from accumulating. Moreover, by correcting phase errors naturally induced by the environment, we demonstrate that encoded quantum superposition states are preserved beyond the dephasing time of the best physical qubit used in the encoding. These results establish a powerful platform for the fundamental investigation of error correction under different types of noise and mark an important step towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

**10.    Hong-Ou-Mandel interference without beam splitters**  
S. M?hrlein, S. Oppel, R. Wiegner, J. von Zanthier  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01639  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new interferometric setup which displays a completely destructive generalized N-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. The key property of this scheme is that is does not require any optical elements like beam splitters or integrated waveguide structures. The interference is intrinsically produced by the evolution of N photons in free space when emitted by N identical statistically independent single photon sources and measured by N detectors in the far field. In this sense the setup is a most simple and natural implementation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect, i.e., of a completely destructive multi-photon interference produced by statistically independent incoherent sources.

**11.    Entanglement formation under random interactions**  
Christoph Wick, Jaegon Um, Haye Hinrichsen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01652  
<blockquote>
<p>
The temporal evolution of the entanglement between two qubits evolving by random interactions is studied analytically and numerically. Two different types of randomness are investigated. Firstly we analyze an ensemble of systems with randomly chosen but time-independent interaction Hamiltonians. Secondly we consider the case of a temporally fluctuating Hamiltonian, where the unitary evolution can be understood as a random walk on the SU (4) group manifold. As a by-product we compute the metric tensor and its inverse as well as the Laplace-Beltrami for SU (4).

**12.    A general dichotomization procedure to provide qudits entanglement criteria**  
Ibrahim Saideh, Alexandre Dias Ribeiro, Giulia Ferrini, Thomas Coudreau, P√©rola Milman, Arne Keller  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01684  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general strategy to derive entanglement criteria which consists in performing a mapping from qudits to qubits that preserves the separability of the parties and SU(2) rotational invariance. Consequently, it is possible to apply the well known positive partial transpose criterion to reveal the existence of quantum correlations between qudits. We discuss some examples of entangled states that are detected using the proposed strategy. Finally, we demonstrate, using our scheme, how some variance-based entanglement witnesses can be generalized from qubits to higher dimensional spin systems.

Philip J. Bustard, Khabat Heshami, Duncan G. England, Michael Spanner, Benjamin J. Sussman  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01729  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme to generate optically-controlled delays based on off-resonant Raman absorption. Dispersion in a transparency window between two neighboring, optically-activated Raman absorption lines is used to reduce the group velocity of broadband 765 nm pulses. We implement this approach in a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) waveguide at room temperature, and demonstrate Raman-induced delays of up to 140 fs for a 650-fs duration, 1.8-THz bandwidth, signal pulse; the available delay-bandwidth product is $\approx1$. Our approach is applicable to single photon signals, offers wavelength tunability, and is a step toward processing ultrafast photons.

**14.    Experimental quantum-walk revival with a time-dependent coin**  
Peng Xue, Rong Zhang, Hao Qin, Xiang Zhan, Zhihao Bian, Jian Li, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review Letters 114, 140502 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01989  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a quantum walk with time-dependent coin bias. With this technique we realize an experimental single-photon one-dimensional quantum walk with a linearly-ramped time-dependent coin flip operation and thereby demonstrate two periodic revivals of the walker distribution. In our beam-displacer interferometer, the walk corresponds to movement between discretely separated transverse modes of the field serving as lattice sites, and the time-dependent coin flip is effected by implementing a different angle between the optical axis of half-wave plate and the light propagation at each step. Each of the quantum-walk steps required to realize a revival comprises two sequential orthogonal coin-flip operators, with one coin having constant bias and the other coin having a time-dependent ramped coin bias, followed by a conditional translation of the walker.

**15.    Quantum filter for a non-Markovian single qubit system**  
Shibei Xue, Matthew R. James, Alireza Shabani, Valery Ugrinovskii, Ian R. Petersen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.02121  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, a quantum filter for estimating the states of a non-Markovian qubit system is presented in an augmented Markovian system framework including both the qubit system of interest and multi-ancillary systems for representing the internal modes of the non-Markovian environment. The colored noise generated by the multi-ancillary systems disturbs the qubit system via a direct interaction. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit is determined by a memory kernel function arising from the dynamics of the ancillary system. In principle, colored noise with arbitrary power spectrum can be generated by a combination of Lorentzian noises. Hence, the quantum filter can be constructed for the qubit disturbed by arbitrary colored noise and the conditional state of the qubit system can be obtained by tracing out the multi-ancillary systems. An illustrative example is given to show the non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit system with Lorentzian noise.

**16.    Performance of two different quantum annealing correction codes**  
Anurag Mishra, Tameem Albash, Daniel Lidar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.02785  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving optimization problems, but like all other quantum information processing methods, it requires error correction to ensure scalability. In this work we experimentally compare two quantum annealing correction codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains, using two different quantum annealing processors. The lower temperature processor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in a number of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubits per encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which we explain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respective redundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with the higher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lower degree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an important tradeoff between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealing correction codes.

**17.    Anomalous behavior of the energy gap in the one-dimensional quantum XY model**  
Manaka Okuyama, Yuuki Yamanaka, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Marek M. Rams  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.02814  
<blockquote>
<p>
We re-examine the well-studied one dimensional spin-1/2 $XY$ model to reveal its nontrivial energy spectrum, in particular the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. In the case of the isotropic $XY$ model -- the $XX$ model -- the gap behaves very irregularly as a function of the system size at a second order transition point. This is in stark contrast to the usual power-law decay of the gap and is reminiscent of the similar behavior at the first order phase transition in the infinite-range quantum $XY$ model. The gap also shows nontrivial oscillatory behavior for the phase transitions in the anisotropic model in the incommensurate phase. We observe a close relation between this anomalous behavior of the gap and the correlation functions. These results, those for the isotropic case in particular, are important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing where the efficiency of computation is strongly affected by the size dependence of the energy gap.

**18.    Two-dimensional quantum walk under artificial magnetic field**  
?. Yal??nkaya, Z. Gedik  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03083  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the Peierls substitution to two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk on a square lattice to examine the spreading dynamics and the coin-position entanglement in the presence of an artificial gauge field. We use the ratio of magnetic flux through unit cell to the flux quantum as a control parameter. For a given flux ratio, we obtain faster spreading for small number of steps and the walker tends to be highly localized around the origin. Moreover, the spreading of the walk can be suppressed and decreased within a limited time interval for specific rational values of flux ratio. When the flux ratio is an irrational number, even for large number of steps, the spreading exhibit diffusive behavior rather than the well-known ballistic one as in the classical random walk and there is a significant probability to find the walker at the origin. We also analyse the coin-position entanglement and show that asymptotic behavior vanishes when the flux ratio is different from zero and the coin-position entanglement become maximal in a periodic manner at long-time range.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03214  
<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated photonics has enabled much progress towards quantum technologies. Many applications, including quantum communication, sensing, and distributed and cloud quantum computing, will require coherent photonic interconnection between separate chip-based sub-systems. Large-scale quantum computing systems and architectures may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable scaling beyond the limits of a single wafer and towards "multi-chip" systems. However, coherently interconnecting separate chips is challenging due to the fragility of these quantum states and the demanding challenges of transmitting photons in at least two media within a single coherent system. Distribution and manipulation of qubit entanglement between multiple devices is one of the most stringent requirements of the interconnected system. Here, we report a quantum photonic interconnect demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and manipulation between two separate chips, implemented using state-of-the-art silicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated and manipulated on-chip, and distributed between the chips by interconverting between path-encoding and polarisation-encoding. We use integrated state analysers to confirm a Bell-type violation of $S$=2.638+-0.039 between two chips. With improvements in loss, this quantum interconnect will provide new levels of flexible systems and architectures for quantum technologies.

**20.    Grover's search with local and total depolarizing channel errors**  
Ilan Cohn, Andr√© L. Fonseca de Oliveira, Efrain Buksman, Jes√∫s Garc√≠a L√≥pez de Lacalle  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03302  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article the effect of noise on Grover's algorithm is analyzed, modeled as a total depolarizing channel (TDCh) and a local depolarizing channel in each qubit (LDCh). The focus was not in error correction (e.g. by the fault-tolerant method), but to provide an insight to the kind of error, or degradation, that needs to be corrected. The results extend previous works regarding only the TDCh model, concluding that the degradation of Grover's algorithm with local error (LDCh) is worse than with total error (TDCh). It has been shown that for both cases with an $N$-dependent small enough error-width, smaller than $1/\sqrt{N}$ for total error and $1/(\sqrt{N}\log_2{N})$ for the local case, correction is not needed.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03429  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is a fundamental challenge in quantum optics to deterministically generate indistinguishable single photons through non-deterministic nonlinear optical processes, due to the intrinsic coupling of single- and multi-photon generation probabilities in these processes. Actively multiplexing photons generated in many temporal modes can decouple these probabilities, but key issues are to minimize resource requirements to allow scalability, and to ensure indistinguishability of the generated photons. We demonstrate the multiplexing of photons from four temporal modes solely using fiber-integrated optics and off-the-shelf electronic circuits. We show a 100% enhancement to the single photon output probability without introducing additional multi-photon noise. Photon indistinguishability is confirmed by a four-fold Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference with a 91% visibility. Our demonstration paves the way for scalable multiplexing of many non-deterministic photon sources to a single near-deterministic source, which will be of benefit to future quantum photonic technologies.

**22.    Strongly driven nonlinear quantum optics in microring resonators**  
Z. Vernon, J.E. Sipe  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03741  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed analysis of strongly driven spontaneous four-wave mixing in a lossy integrated microring resonator side-coupled to a channel waveguide. A nonperturbative, analytic solution within the undepleted pump approximation is developed for a cw pump input of arbitrary intensity. In the strongly driven regime self- and cross-phase modulation, as well as multi-pair generation, lead to a rich variety of power-dependent effects; the results are markedly different than in the low power limit. The photon pair generation rate, single photon spectrum, and joint spectral intensity (JSI) distribution are calculated. Splitting of the generated single photon spectrum into a doublet structure associated with both pump detuning and cross-phase modulation is predicted, as well as substantial narrowing of the generated signal and idler bandwidths associated with the onset of optical parametric oscillation at intermediate powers. Both the correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the JSI are calculated, and for sufficient powers the uncorrelated part of the JSI is found to form a quadruplet structure. The pump detuning is found to play a crucial role in all of these phenomena, and a critical detuning is identified which divides the system behaviour into distinct regimes, as well as an optimal detuning strategy which preserves many of the low-power characteristics of the generated photons for arbitrary input power.

**23.    Continuous error correction for Ising anyons**  
Adrian Hutter, James R. Wootton  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.04033  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum gates in topological quantum computation are performed by braiding non-Abelian anyons. These braiding processes can be performed with very low error rates. However, to make a topological quantum computation architecture truly scalable, even rare errors need to be corrected. Error correction for non-Abelian anyons is complicated by the fact that it needs to be performed on a continuous basis and further errors may occur while we are correcting existing ones. Here, we provide the first study of this problem and prove its feasibility, establishing non-Abelian anyons as a viable platform for scalable quantum computation. We thereby focus on Ising anyons as the most prominent example of non-Abelian anyons and show that for these a finite error rate can indeed be corrected continuously. There is a threshold error rate $p_c>0$ such that for all error rates $p<p_c$ the probability of a logical error per time-step can be made exponentially small in the distance of a logical qubit.

Expressions with permanents in quantum processes with bosons deserved recently certain attention. A difference between couple relevant models is discussed in presented work.

**25.    Photon Correlations Generated by Inelastic Scattering in a One-Dimensional Waveguide Coupled to Three-Level Systems**  
Yao-Lung L. Fang, Harold U. Baranger  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.04164  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study photon correlations generated by scattering from three-level systems (3LS) in one dimension. The two systems studied are a 3LS in a semi-infinite waveguide (3LS plus a mirror) and two 3LS in an infinite waveguide (double 3LS). Our scattering approach naturally connects photon correlation effects with inelastically scattered photons; it corresponds to input-output theory in the weak-probe limit. At the resonance where electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) occurs, we find that no photons are scattered inelastically and hence there are no induced correlations. Slightly away from EIT, the total inelastically scattered flux is large, being substantially enhanced due to the additional interference paths. This enhancement carries over to the two-photon correlation function, which exhibits non-classical behavior such as strong bunching with a very long time-scale. The long time scale originates from the slow-light effect associated with EIT.

**26.    Linear optics only allows every possible quantum operation for one photon or one port**  
Julio Jos√© Moyano-Fern√°ndez, Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.04342  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the evolution of the quantum state of $n$ photons in $m$ different modes when they go through a lossless linear optical system. We show that there are quantum evolution operators $U$ that cannot be built with linear optics alone unless the number of photons or the number of modes is equal to one. The evolution for single photons can be controlled with the known realization of any unitary proved by Reck, Zeilinger, Bernstein and Bertani. The evolution for a single mode corresponds to the trivial evolution in a phase shifter. We analyze these two cases and prove that any other combination of the number of photons and modes produces a Hilbert state too big for the linear optics system to give any desired evolution.

<blockquote>
<p>
The possibility to induce predetermined coherent quantum dynamics by controlling only the dissipative environmental parameters (such as temperature and pressure) is studied using the combined optimal control and environment engineering frameworks. As an example, we consider the problem of transforming an optically excited donor state into free charge carriers via intermediate higher-lying bridge state(s), with a view to solar energy conversion. In this context, vibrational bath engineering allows to promote fast, directional charge transfer and to suppress recombinative losses.

**28.    Ultrafast Optimal Sideband Cooling under Non-Markovian Evolution**  
Johan F. Triana, Andr√©s F. Estrada, Leonardo A. Pachon  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.04869  
<blockquote>
<p>
A sideband cooling strategy that incorporates (i) the dynamics induced by structured (non-Markovian) environments in the target and auxiliary systems and (ii) the optimally-time-modulated interaction between them is developed. For the context of cavity optomechanics, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered in the target system, ground state cooling is reached at much faster rates and at much lower phonon occupation number than previously reported. In constrast to similar current strategies, ground state cooling is reached here for coupling-strength rates that are experimentally accesible for the state-of-the-art implementations. After the ultrafast optimal-ground-state-cooling protocol is accomplished, an additional optimal control strategy is considered to maintain the phonon number as closer as possible to the one obtained in the cooling procedure. Contrary to the conventional expectation, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered in the auxiliary system, the efficiency of the cooling protocol is undermined.

Numerical simulations show distinctly different distributions for the most important figure of merit of adiabatic quantum computing --- the success probability --- in these two cases.

**30.    Grover's search with faults on some marked elements**  
Dmitry Kravchenko, Nikolajs Nahimovs, Alexander Rivosh  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05108  
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover's algorithm is a quantum query algorithm solving the unstructured search problem of size $N$ using $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. It provides a significant speed-up over any classical algorithm \cite{Gro96}. The running time of the algorithm, however, is very sensitive to errors in queries. It is known that if query may fail (report all marked elements as unmarked) the algorithm needs $\Omega(N)$ queries to find a marked element \cite{RS08}. \cite{AB+13} have proved the same result for the model where each marked element has its own probability to be reported as unmarked. We study the behavior of Grover's algorithm in the model where the search space contains both faulty and non-faulty marked elements. We show that in this setting it is indeed possible to find one of non-faulty marked items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. We also analyze the limiting behavior of the algorithm for a large number of steps and show the existence and the structure of limiting state $\rho_{lim}$.

**31.    Simulating the discrete-time quantum walk dynamics with simultaneous coin and shift operators**  
Jalil Khatibi Moqadam, Marcos Cesar de Oliveira  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05270  
<blockquote>
<p>
We implement the discrete-time quantum walk model using the continuous-time evolution of the Hamiltonian that includes both the shift and the coin generators. Based on the Trotter-Suzuki first-order approximation, we consider an optimization problem in which the Hellinger distance between the walker probability distributions resulted from the evolution of such Hamiltonian and the quantum walk dynamics is minimized. The phase space implementation of the quantum walk is considered where the walker state is encoded on the coherent state of a resonator and the coin on the two-level state of a qubit. In this approach, no mechanism for switching between the coin and the shift operators is included. We show the Hellinger distance is bounded for large number of time steps. The distance is small when we deviate from the standard quantum walk model, namely, when the walker is allowed to move in between the sites. In simulating the standard quantum walk model, the distance is large but bounded by $26\%$ for a relevant number of time steps. Even so, the system evolution shows the essential characteristics of the standard quantum walk dynamics, namely, the ballistic evolution of the probability distribution and the linear growth of the corresponding standard deviation. Moreover, the entanglement generated in this approach is approximately the same as the entanglement generated in the standard quantum walk dynamics. Finally, the system dynamics under the influence of the decoherence also shows the similar quantum-to-classical transition as in the standard quantum walk dynamics.

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05790  
<blockquote>
<p>
Dynamical decoupling protocols are one of the most used tools for efficient quantum error corrections and for reservoir engineering. In this paper we study the effect of dynamical decoupling pulses on the preservation of both quantum and classical correlations, and their influence on the intriguing phenomenon of time-invariant discord. We study two qubits experiencing local dephasing with an Ohmic class spectrum and subject to dynamical decoupling protocols. We investigate the connection between the dynamics of both classical and quantum correlations and the behaviour of information flow between system and environment. Finally, we establish a set of necessary conditions for which time-invariant discord can be created using dynamically decoupling techniques.

**33.    Serialized Quantum Error Correction Protocol for High-Bandwidth Quantum Repeaters**  
Andrew N. Glaudell, Edo Waks, Jacob M. Taylor  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05966  
<blockquote>
<p>
Advances in single photon creation, transmission, and detection suggest that sending quantum information over optical fibers may have losses low enough to be correctable using a quantum error correcting code. Such error-corrected communication is equivalent to a novel quantum repeater scheme, but crucial questions regarding implementation and system requirements remain open. Here we show that long range entangled bit generation with rates approaching $10^8$ ebits/s may be possible using a completely serialized protocol, in which photons are generated, entangled, and error corrected via sequential, one-way interactions with a minimal number of matter qubits. Provided loss and error rates of the required elements are below the threshold for quantum error correction, this scheme demonstrates improved performance over transmission of single photons. We find improvement in ebit rates at large distances using this serial protocol and various quantum error correcting codes.

<blockquote>
<p>
Magnonics is an emerging field with potential applications in classical and quantum information processing. Freely propagating magnons in two-dimensional media suffer from dispersion, which limits their effective range and fidelity. We show the design of controllable magnonic circuitry, that utilise surface current carrying wires to create magnonic waveguides. We also show the design of a magnonic directional coupler and controllable Michelson interferometer to demonstrate its utility for information processing tasks.

**35.    Quantum simulation of the Anderson Hamiltonian with an array of coupled nanoresonators: delocalization and thermalization effects**

http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.06984  
<blockquote>
<p>
The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool for quantum many-body effects is explored. It is demonstrated that an array of electrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the Bose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon regime to the Anderson tight-binding model. Employing a density matrix formalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the interplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization process. It is found that the phonon population remains localized for low enough temperatures even if the total population of excitations is lost from the array due to dissipative effects; with increasing temperatures the localization is lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing in the steady regime a fully thermalized system. Finally, we consider a possible experimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a superconducting qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators. We also consider the possibility of using the proposed quantum simulator for realizing continuous-time quantum walks.

**36.    PT-symmetric Rabi model: Perturbation theory**  
Tony E. Lee, Yogesh N. Joglekar  
Phys. Rev. A 92, 042103 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07001  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a non-Hermitian version of the Rabi model, where a two-level system is periodically driven with an imaginary-valued drive strength, leading to alternating gain and loss. In the Floquet picture, the model exhibits PT symmetry, which can be broken when the drive is sufficiently strong. We derive the boundaries of the PT phase diagram for the different resonances by doing perturbation theory beyond the rotating-wave approximation. For the main resonance, we show that the non-Hermitian analog of the Bloch-Siegert shift corresponds to maximal PT-breaking. For the higher-order resonances, we capture the boundaries to lowest order. We also solve the regime of high frequency by mapping to the Wannier-Stark ladder. Our model can be experimentally realized in waveguides with spatially-modulated loss or in atoms with time-modulated spontaneous decay.

**37.    Symmetry Protected Topological Phases and Majorana Mode in One-dimensional Quantum Walk with Boundary**  
Ho Tat Lam, Yue Yu, Kwok Yip Szeto  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07528  
<blockquote>
<p>
The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by the coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states in one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin parameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with quasi-energy $E=0,\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different boundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary conditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be computed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes are provided.

**38.    Generic Quantum Walks with Memory**  
Dan Li, Michael Mc Gettrick, Fei Gao, Jie Xu, Qiao-Yan Wen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07674  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks with memory are a type of modified quantum walk that records the walker's latest path. In this work, we show that a quantum walk with memory on a digraph can be transformed as a quantum walk without memory on the line digraph of the original one. With this correspondence, we construct a model which includes all possible standard quantum walks with memory on regular graphs. This construction would help us to study quantum walks with memory and also help in corresponding experiments. Based on this model, by taking the straight line as example, we study the general properties of quantum walks with memory, such as variance, occupancy rate and localization. Interestingly, we find that a quantum walk with memory can produce the same probability distribution as that of a standard quantum walk whose initial spin state is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|0\rangle_p(|1\rangle_c+i|-1\rangle_c)$.

**39.    Nonlinear Gamow vectors, shock waves and irreversibility in optically nonlocal media**

Physical Review A 92, 023801 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00692  
<blockquote>
<p>
Dispersive shock waves dominate wave-breaking phenomena in Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of loss, these highly irregular and disordered waves are potentially reversible. However, no experimental evidence has been given about the possibility of inverting the dynamics of a dispersive shock wave and turn it into a regular wave-front. Nevertheless, the opposite scenario, i.e., a smooth wave generating turbulent dynamics is well studied and observed in experiments. Here we introduce a new theoretical formulation for the dynamics in a highly nonlocal and defocusing medium described by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Our theory unveils a mechanism that enhances the degree of irreversibility. This mechanism explains why a dispersive shock cannot be reversed in evolution even for an arbitrarirly small amount of loss. Our theory is based on the concept of nonlinear Gamow vectors, i.e., power dependent generalizations of the counter-intuitive and hereto elusive exponentially decaying states in Hamiltonian systems. We theoretically show that nonlinear Gamow vectors play a fundamental role in nonlinear Schroedinger models: they may be used as a generalized basis for describing the dynamics of the shock waves, and affect the degree of irreversibility of wave-breaking phenomena. Gamow vectors allow to analytically calculate the amount of breaking of time-reversal with a quantitative agreement with numerical solutions. We also show that a nonlocal nonlinear optical medium may act as a simulator for the experimental investigation of quantum irreversible models, as the reversed harmonic oscillator.

**40.    Long-range Ising and Kitaev Models: Phases, Correlations and Edge Modes**  
Davide Vodola, Luca Lepori, Elisa Ercolessi, Guido Pupillo  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00820  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the quantum phases, correlation functions and edge modes for a class of spin-1/2 and fermionic models related to the one-dimensional Ising chain in the presence of a transverse field. These models are the Ising chain with anti-ferromagnetic long-range interactions that decay with distance as $1/r^\alpha$, as well as a related class of fermionic Hamiltonians that generalise the Kitaev chain, where both the hopping and pairing terms are long-range and their relative strength can be varied. For these models, we provide the complete phase diagram for all exponents $\alpha$, based on an analysis of the entanglement entropy, the decay of correlation functions, and the edge modes in the case of open chains. We demonstrate that violations of the area law can occur for $\alpha \lesssim1$, while connected correlation functions can decay with a hybrid exponential and power-law behaviour, with a power that is $\alpha$-dependent. Interestingly, for the fermionic models we provide an exact analytical derivation for such a behaviour at every $\alpha$. Along the critical lines, for all models breaking of conformal symmetry is argued at low enough $\alpha$. For the fermionic models we show that the edge modes, massless for $\alpha \gtrsim 1$, can acquire a mass for $\alpha < 1$. The mass of these states can be tuned by varying the relative strength of the kinetic and pairing terms in the Hamiltonian. Interestingly, for the Ising chain a similar edge localization appears for excited bulk states on the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram, where edge modes are not expected. We argue that, at least for the fermionic chains, these massive states correspond to the appearance of new phases, notably approached via quantum phase transitions without mass gap closure. Finally, we discuss the possibility to detect some of these effects in experiments with cold trapped ions.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantized lateral motional states and the spin states of electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed as basic building blocks of a scalable quantum computer. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) allows strong dipole coupling between electrons and a high-Q superconducting microwave resonator, enabling such sensitive detection and manipulation of electron degrees of freedom. Here we present the first realization of a hybrid circuit in which a large number of electrons are trapped on the surface of superfluid helium inside a coplanar waveguide resonator. The high finesse of the resonator allows us to observe large dispersive shifts that are many times the linewidth and make fast and sensitive measurements on the collective vibrational modes of the electron ensemble, as well as the superfluid helium film underneath. Furthermore, a large ensemble coupling is observed in the dispersive regime during experiment, and it shows excellent agreement with our numeric model. The coupling strength of the ensemble to the cavity is found to be >1 MHz per electron, indicating the feasibility of achieving single electron strong coupling.

Kejie Fang, Matthew H. Matheny, Xingsheng Luan, Oskar Painter  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05138  
<blockquote>
<p>
The mechanical properties of light have found widespread use in the manipulation of gas-phase atoms and ions, helping create new states of matter and realize complex quantum interactions. The field of cavity-optomechanics strives to scale this interaction to much larger, even human-sized mechanical objects. Going beyond the canonical Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, here we explore a new paradigm in which multiple cavity-optomechanical elements are wired together to form optomechanical circuits. Using a pair of optomechanical cavities coupled together via a phonon waveguide we demonstrate a tunable delay and filter for microwave-over-optical signal processing. In addition, we realize a tight-binding form of mechanical coupling between distant optomechanical cavities, leading to direct phonon exchange without dissipation in the waveguide. These measurements indicate the feasibility of phonon-routing based information processing in optomechanical crystal circuitry, and further, to the possibility of realizing topological phases of photons and phonons in optomechanical cavity lattices.

<blockquote>
<p>
The absolute frequency of the $^{87}{\rm Sr}$ lattice clock transition was evaluated with an uncertainty of $1.1\times 10^{-15}$ using a frequency link to the international atomic time (TAI). The frequency uncertainty of a hydrogen maser used as a transfer oscillator was reduced by homogeneously distributed intermittent measurement over a five-day grid of TAI. Three sets of four or five days measurements as well as systematic uncertainty of the clock at $8.6\times 10^{-17}$ have resulted in an absolute frequency of $^{87}{\rm Sr}\ {}^1S_0 - {}^3P_0$ clock transition to be 429 228 004 229 872.85 (47) Hz.

L. Ferialdi, D. D√ºrr  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07860  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a system coupled to chain of first neighbor interacting oscillators. After deriving the exact dynamics of the system, we prove that one can effectively describe the exact dynamics by considering a suitable shorter chain. We provide the explicit expression for such an effective dynamics and we provide an upper bound on the error one makes considering it instead of the dynamics of the full chain. We eventually prove how error, timescale and number of modes in the truncated chain are related.
