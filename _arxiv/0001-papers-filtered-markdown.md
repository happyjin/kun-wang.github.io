**1.    The class of languages recognizable by 1-way quantum finite automata is not closed under union**  
Maris Valdats  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001005  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we develop little further the theory of quantum finite automata (QFA). There are already few properties of QFA known, that deterministic and probabilistic finite automata do not have e.g. they cannot recognize all regular languages. In this paper we show, that class of languages recognizable by QFA is not closed under union, even not under any Boolean operation, where both arguments are significant.

**2.    Separability and Fourier representations of density matrices**  
Arthur O. Pittenger, Morton H. Rubin  
Phys. Rev. A62, 032313 (2000).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001014  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using the finite Fourier transform, we introduce a generalization of Pauli-spin matrices for $d$-dimensional spaces, and the resulting set of unitary matrices $S(d) $ is a basis for $d\times d$ matrices. If $N=d_{1}\times d_{2}\times...\times d_{b}$ and $H^{[ N]}=\bigotimes H^{ % [ d_{k}]}$, we give a sufficient condition for separability of a density matrix $\rho $ relative to the $H^{[ d_{k}]}$ in terms of the $L_{1}$ norm of the spin coefficients of $\rho >.$ Since the spin representation depends on the form of the tensor product, the theory applies to both full and partial separability on a given space $H^{[ N]}$% . It follows from this result that for a prescribed form of separability, there is always a neighborhood of the normalized identity in which every density matrix is separable. We also show that for every prime $p$ and $n>1$ the generalized Werner density matrix $W^{[ p^{n}]}(s) $ is fully separable if and only if $s\leq (1+p^{n-1}) ^{-1}$.

**3.    Quantum Diffusions and Appell Systems**  
Demosthenes Ellinas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001047  
<blockquote>
<p>
Within the algebraic framework of Hopf algebras, random walks and associated diffusion equations (master equations) are constructed and studied for two basic operator algebras of Quantum Mechanics i.e the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra (hw) and its q-deformed version hw_q. This is done by means of functionals determined by the associated coherent state density operators. The ensuing master equations admit solutions given by hw and hw_q-valued Appell systems.

**4.    Geometric Phase, Curvature, and Extrapotentials in Constrained Quantum Systems**  
Kevin A. Mitchell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001059  
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive an effective Hamiltonian for a quantum system constrained to a submanifold (the constraint manifold) of configuration space (the ambient space) by an infinite restoring force. We pay special attention to how this Hamiltonian depends on quantities which are external to the constraint manifold, such as the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the (Riemannian) curvature of the ambient space, and the constraining potential. In particular, we find the remarkable fact that the twisting of the constraining potential appears as a gauge potential in the constrained Hamiltonian. This gauge potential is an example of geometric phase, closely related to that originally discussed by Berry. The constrained Hamiltonian also contains an effective potential depending on the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the curvature of the ambient space, and the twisting of the constraining potential. The general nature of our analysis allows applications to a wide variety of problems, such as rigid molecules, the evolution of molecular systems along reaction paths, and quantum strip waveguides.

**5.    Actual computational time-cost of the Quantum Fourier Transform in a quantum computer using nuclear spins**  
A.Saito, K.Kioi, Y.Akagi, N.Hashizume, K.Ohta  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0001113  
<blockquote>
<p>
We found that the actual computational time-cost of the QFT is O(n 2^n) for large n in a quantum computer using nuclear spins. The computational cost of a quantum algorithm has usually been estimated as the sum of the universal gates required in such ideal mathematical models as the Quantum Turing Machine(QTM) and the quantum circuit. This cost is proportional to an actual time-cost in the physical implementation where all quantum operations can be achieved in the same time. However, if the implementation takes a different time for each quantum gate, there is a possibility that the actual time-cost will have a different behavior from the ideal cost. So we estimated the actual time-cost of the QFT in these implementations by considering the gating time. The actual time-cost is drastically different from O(n^2) estimated by complexity analysis.

**6.    Photonic excess noise and wave localization**  
C.W.J. Beenakker, M. Patra, P.W. Brouwer  
Phys.Rev.A 61, 051801 (2000)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0001157  
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a theory for the effect of localization on the super-Poissonian noise of radiation propagating through an absorbing disordered waveguide. Localization suppresses both the mean photon current I and the noise power P, but the Fano factor P/I is found to remain unaffected. For strong absorption the Fano factor has the universal value 1+3f/2 (with f the Bose-Einstein function), regardless of whether the waveguide is long or short compared to the localization length.

**7.    Query Complexity: Worst-Case Quantum Versus Average-Case Classical**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0001013  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this note we investigate the relationship between worst-case quantum query complexity and average-case classical query complexity. Specifically, we show that if a quantum computer can evaluate a total Boolean function f with bounded error using T queries in the worst case, then a deterministic classical computer can evaluate f using O(T^5) queries in the average case, under a uniform distribution of inputs. If f is monotone, we show furthermore that only O(T^3) queries are needed. Previously, Beals et al. (1998) showed that if a quantum computer can evaluate f with bounded error using T queries in the worst case, then a deterministic classical computer can evaluate f using O(T^6) queries in the worst case, or O(T^4) if f is monotone. The optimal bound is conjectured to be O(T^2), but improving on O(T^6) remains an open problem. Relating worst-case quantum complexity to average-case classical complexity may suggest new ways to reduce the polynomial gap in the ordinary worst-case versus worst-case setting.
