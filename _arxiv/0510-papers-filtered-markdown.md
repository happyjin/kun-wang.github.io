**1.    Entanglement verification for quantum key distribution systems with an underlying bipartite qubit-mode structure**  
Johannes Rigas, Otfried Gühne, Norbert Lütkenhaus  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 012341 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510022  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider entanglement detection for quantum key distribution systems that use two signal states and continuous variable measurements. This problem can be formulated as a separability problem in a qubit-mode system. To verify entanglement, we introduce an object that combines the covariance matrix of the mode with the density matrix of the qubit. We derive necessary separability criteria for this scenario. These criteria can be readily evaluated using semidefinite programming and we apply them to the specific quantum key distribution protocol.

**2.    Programmable quantum channels and measurements**  
Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano, Paolo Perinotti  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510033  
<blockquote>
<p>
We review some partial results for two strictly related problems. The first problem consists in finding the optimal joint unitary transformation on system and ancilla which is the most efficient in programming any desired channel on the system by changing the state of the ancilla. In this respect we present a solution for dimension two for both system and ancilla. The second problem consists in finding the optimal universal programmable detector, namely a device that can be tuned to perform any desired measurement on a given quantum system, by changing the state of an ancilla. With a finite dimension for the ancilla only approximate universal programmability is possible, with minimal dimension increasing function versus the precision of the approximation. We show that one can achieve a dimension growing polynomially versus the precision, and even linearly in specific cases.

**3.    Decoherence induced by a chaotic environment: A quantum walker with a complex coin**  
Leonardo Ermann, Juan Pablo Paz, Marcos Saraceno  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 012302 (2006).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510037  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the differences between the process of decoherence induced by chaotic and regular environments. For this we analyze a family of simple models wich contain both regular and chaotic environments. In all cases the system of interest is a "quantum walker", i.e. a quantum particle that can move on a lattice with a finite number of sites. The walker interacts with an environment wich has a D dimensional Hilbert space. The results we obtain suggest that regular and chaotic environments are not distinguishable from each other in a (short) timescale t*, wich scales with the dimensionality of the environment as t*~log(D). Howeber, chaotic environments continue to be effective over exponentially longer timescales while regular environments tend to reach saturation much sooner. We present both numerical and analytical results supporting this conclusion. The family of chaotic evolutions we consider includes the so-called quantum multi-baker-map as a particular case.

**4.    Quantum Walk with a time-dependent coin**  
M.C. Banuls, C. Navarrete, A. Perez, Eugenio Roldan, J.C. Soriano  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510046  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce quantum walks with a time-dependent coin, and show how they include, as a particular case, the generalized quantum walk recently studied by Wojcik et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{93}, 180601(2004){]} which exhibits interesting dynamical localization and quasiperiodic dynamics. Our proposal allows for a much easier implementation of this particular rich dynamics than the original one. Moreover, it allows for an additional control on the walk, which can be used to compensate for phases appearing due to external interactions. To illustrate its feasibility, we discuss an example using an optical cavity. We also derive an approximated solution in the continuous limit (long--wavelength approximation) which provides physical insight about the process.

K.-A. Brickman, P. C. Haljan, P. J. Lee, M. Acton, L. Deslauriers, C. Monroe  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510066  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the implementation of Grover's quantum search algorithm in the scalable system of trapped atomic ion quantum bits. Any one of four possible states of a two-qubit memory is marked, and following a single query of the search space, the marked element is successfully recovered with an average probability of 60(2)%. This exceeds the performance of any possible classical search algorithm, which can only succeed with a maximum average probability of 50%.

**6.    Tsirelson bounds for generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities**  
Stephanie Wehner  
Phys. Rev. A, 73, 022110 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510076  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum theory imposes a strict limit on the strength of non-local correlations. It only allows for a violation of the CHSH inequality up to the value 2 sqrt(2), known as Tsirelson's bound. In this note, we consider generalized CHSH inequalities based on many measurement settings with two possible measurement outcomes each. We demonstrate how to prove Tsirelson bounds for any such generalized CHSH inequality using semidefinite programming. As an example, we show that for any shared entangled state and observables X_1,...,X_n and Y_1,...,Y_n with eigenvalues +/- 1 we have |<X_1 Y_1> + <X_2 Y_1> + <X_2 Y_2> + <X_3 Y_2> + ... + <X_n Y_n> - <X_1 Y_n>| <= 2 n cos(pi/(2n)). It is well known that there exist observables such that equality can be achieved. However, we show that these are indeed optimal. Our approach can easily be generalized to other inequalities for such observables.

**7.    Hashing protocol for distilling multipartite CSS states**  
Erik Hostens, Jeroen Dehaene, Bart De Moor  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 042316 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510096  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a hashing protocol for distilling multipartite CSS states by means of local Clifford operations, Pauli measurements and classical communication. It is shown that this hashing protocol outperforms previous versions by exploiting information theory to a full extent an not only applying CNOTs as local Clifford operations. Using the information-theoretical notion of a strongly typical set, we calculate the asymptotic yield of the protocol as the solution of a linear programming problem.

**8.    Experimental realization of a minimal disturbance quantum measurement**  
F. Sciarrino, M. Ricci, F. De Martini, R. Filip, L. Mista Jr  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 020408 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510097  
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the first experimental realization of an ''optimal'' quantum device able to perform a Minimal Disturbance Measurement (MDM) on polarization encoded qubits saturating the theoretical boundary established between the classical knowledge acquired of any input state, i.e. the classical "guess", and the fidelity of the same state after disturbance due to measurement . The device has been physically realized by means of a linear optical qubit manipulation, post-selection measurement and a classical feed-forward process.

**9.    Quantization and Asymptotic Behaviour of $ε_{V^{k}}$ Quantum Random Walk on Integers**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Smyrnakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510098  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantization and asymptotic behaviour of a variant of discrete random walk on integers are investigated. This variant, the $\epsilon_{V^{k}}$ walk, has the novel feature that it uses many identical quantum coins keeping at the same time characteristic quantum features like the quadratically faster than the classical spreading rate, and unexpected distribution cutoffs. A weak limit of the position probability distribution (pd) is obtained, and universal properties of this arch sine asymptotic distribution function are examined. Questions of driving the walk are investigated by means of a quantum optical interaction model that reveals robustness of quantum features of walker's asymptotic pd, against stimulated and spontaneous quantum noise on the coin system.

**10.    Error Analysis For Encoding A Qubit In An Oscillator**  
S. Glancy, E. Knill  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 012325 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510107  
<blockquote>
<p>
In the paper titled "Encoding A Qubit In An Oscillator" Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill [quant-ph/0008040] described a method to encode a qubit in the continuous Hilbert space of an oscillator's position and momentum variables. This encoding provides a natural error correction scheme that can correct errors due to small shifts of the position or momentum wave functions (i.e., use of the displacement operator). We present bounds on the size of correctable shift errors when both qubit and ancilla states may contain errors. We then use these bounds to constrain the quality of input qubit and ancilla states.

**11.    Asymptotics of Quantum Random Walk Driven by Optical Cavity**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Smyrnakis  
Journal of Optics B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 7 (2005) S152 - S157  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510112  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a novel quantum random walk (QRW) model, possibly useful in quantum algorithm implementation, that achieves a quadratically faster diffusion rate compared to its classical counterpart. We evaluate its asymptotic behavior expressed in the form of a limit probability distribution of a double horn shape. Questions of robustness and control of that limit distribution are addressed by introducing a quantum optical cavity in which a resonant Jaynes-Cummings type of interaction between the quantum walk coin system realized in the form of a two-level atom and a laser field is taking place. Driving the optical cavity by means of the coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state, we determine two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW. In the first one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling, while in the second one the quantum features of the walk, exemplified by enhanced diffusion rate, are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail. Verification of these findings in an experimental setup that involves two quantum optical cavities that implement the driven QRW and its quantum to classical transition is discussed.

**13.    On Algebraic and Quantum Random Walks**  
Demosthenes Ellinas  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510128  
<blockquote>
<p>
Algebraic random walks (ARW) and quantum mechanical random walks (QRW) are investigated and related. Based on minimal data provided by the underlying bialgebras of functions defined on e. g the real line R, the abelian finite group Z_N, and the canonical Heisenberg-Weyl algebra hw, and by introducing appropriate functionals on those algebras, examples of ARWs are constructed. These walks involve short and long range transition probabilities as in the case of R walk, bistochastic matrices as for the case of Z_N walk, or coherent state vectors as in the case of hw walk. The increase of classical entropy due to majorization order of those ARWs is shown, and further their corresponding evolution equations are obtained. Especially for the case of hw ARW, the diffusion limit of evolution equation leads to a quantum master equation for the density matrix of a boson system interacting with a bath of quantum oscillators prepared in squeezed vacuum state. A number of generalizations to other types of ARWs and some open problems are also stated. Next, QRWs are briefly presented together with some of their distinctive properties, such as their enhanced diffusion rates, and their behavior in respect to the relation of majorization to quantum entropy. Finally, the relation of ARWs to QRWs is investigated in terms of the theorem of unitary extension of completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) evolution maps by means of auxiliary vector spaces. It is applied to extend the CPTP step evolution map of a ARW for a quantum walker system into a unitary step evolution map for an associated QRW of a walker+quantum coin system. Examples and extensions are provided.

<p>
We describe a fault-tolerant one-way quantum computer on cluster states in three dimensions. The presented scheme uses methods of topological error correction resulting from a link between cluster states and surface codes. The error threshold is 1.4% for local depolarizing error and 0.11% for each source in an error model with preparation-, gate-, storage- and measurement errors.

**15.    Hitting time for quantum walks on the hypercube**  
Hari Krovi, Todd A. Brun  
Phys. Rev. A 73, 032341 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510136  
<blockquote>
<p>
Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before the walk reaches an ending condition. To be analogous to the hitting time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogues of hitting time suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of unitary ``coin'' is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems to play an important role in both dramatic speed-ups and slow-downs of quantum walks.

**16.    Quantum Analogical Modeling: A General Quantum Computing Algorithm for Predicting Language Behavior**  
Royal Skousen  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510146  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper proposes a general quantum algorithm that can be applied to any classical computer program. Each computational step is written using reversible operators, but the operators remain classical in that the qubits take on values of only zero and one. This classical restriction on the quantum states allows the copying of qubits, a necessary requirement for doing general classical computation. Parallel processing of the quantum algorithm proceeds because of the superpositioning of qubits, the only aspect of the algorithm that is strictly quantum mechanical. Measurement of the system collapses the superposition, leaving only one state that can be observed. In most instances, the loss of information as a result of measurement would be unacceptable. But the linguistically motivated theory of Analogical Modeling (AM) proposes that the probabilistic nature of language behavior can be accurately modeled in terms of the simultaneous analysis of all possible contexts (referred to as supracontexts) providing one selects a single supracontext from those supracontexts that are homogeneous in behavior (namely, supracontexts that allow no increase in uncertainty). The amplitude for each homogeneous supracontext is proportional to its frequency of occurrence, with the result that the probability of selecting one particular supracontext to predict the behavior of the system is proportional to the square of its frequency.

**17.    Numerical Implementation of Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion**  
Joshua Wilkie, Ray Ng  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510171  
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) is a non-relativistic but otherwise exact theory which expresses the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary subsystem, interacting linearly with an uncoupled harmonic oscillator bath, as an average of diadics formed from state vectors which obey stochastic variational-differential equations. The vacuum radiation field can be represented as such an oscillator bath, and so this model is in widespread use in quantum optics. Prior to the development of NMQSD, exact subsystem solutions could only be obtained in a few special cases (e.g. spin-1/2, harmonic oscillator). Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to obtain exact solutions to new problems using NMQSD due to the difficulty of solving the variational-differential equations. Here we show that these equations can be transformed into a pair of coupled nonlinear integrodifferential equations. We develop exact numerical methods for the integrodifferential equations and show that solutions can be readily obtained to good accuracy for quite general subsystems. We exactly solve various examples including tunneling in a double well representing molecular isomerization or racemization, suppression of fluorescence from a two-level atom in a band gap, and intermittent fluorescence from a driven three level system representing electronic states of singly ionized magnesium.

**18.    Investigation of Continuous-Time Quantum Walk Via Spectral Distribution Associated with Adjacency Matrix**  
M.A.Jafarizadeh, S. Salimi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510174  
<blockquote>
<p>
Using the spectral distribution associated with the adjacency matrix of graphs, we introduce a new method of calculation of amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on some rather important graphs, such as line, cycle graph $C_n$, complete graph $K_n$, graph $G_n$, finite path and some other finite and infinite graphs, where all are connected with orthogonal polynomials such as Hermite, Laguerre, Tchebichef and some other orthogonal polynomials. It is shown that using the spectral distribution, one can obtain the infinite time asymptotic behavior of amplitudes simply by using the method of stationary phase approximation(WKB approximation), where as an example, the method is applied to star, two-dimensional comb lattices, infinite Hermite and Laguerre graphs. Also by using the Gauss quadrature formula one can approximate infinite graphs with finite ones and vice versa, in order to derive large time asymptotic behavior by WKB method. Likewise, using this method, some new graphs are introduced, where their amplitude are proportional to product of amplitudes of some elementary graphs, even though the graphs themselves are not the same as Cartesian product of their elementary graphs. Finally, via calculating mean end to end distance of some infinite graphs at large enough times, it is shown that continuous time quantum walk at different infinite graphs belong to different universality classes which are also different than those of the corresponding classical ones.

**19.    Non-Markovian quantum dynamics: Correlated projection superoperators and Hilbert space averaging**  
Heinz-Peter Breuer, Jochen Gemmer, Mathias Michel  
Phys. Rev. E 73, 016139 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510177  
<blockquote>
<p>
The time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique allows a systematic analysis of the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems. We introduce a class of projection superoperators which project the states of the total system onto certain correlated system-environment states. It is shown that the application of the TCL technique to this class of correlated superoperators enables the non-perturbative treatment of the dynamics of system-environment models for which the standard approach fails in any finite order of the coupling strength. We demonstrate further that the correlated superoperators correspond to the idea of a best guess of conditional quantum expectations which is determined by a suitable Hilbert space average. The general approach is illustrated by means of the model of a spin which interacts through randomly distributed couplings with a finite reservoir consisting of two energy bands. Extensive numerical simulations of the full Schroedinger equation of the model reveal the power and efficiency of the method.

**20.    On the quantum hardness of solving isomorphism problems as nonabelian hidden shift problems**  
Andrew M. Childs, Pawel Wocjan  
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 7, No. 5-6 (2007) 504-521  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510185  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider an approach to deciding isomorphism of rigid n-vertex graphs (and related isomorphism problems) by solving a nonabelian hidden shift problem on a quantum computer using the standard method. Such an approach is arguably more natural than viewing the problem as a hidden subgroup problem. We prove that the hidden shift approach to rigid graph isomorphism is hard in two senses. First, we prove that Omega(n) copies of the hidden shift states are necessary to solve the problem (whereas O(n log n) copies are sufficient). Second, we prove that if one is restricted to single-register measurements, an exponential number of hidden shift states are required.

**21.    Markov property and strong additivity of von Neumann entropy for graded quantum systems**  
Hajime Moriya  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510197  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is easy to verify the equivalence of the quantum Markov property and the strong additivity of entropy for graded quantum systems as well. However, the structure of Markov states for graded systems is different from that for tensor product systems. For three-composed graded systems there are U(1)-gauge invariant Markov states whose restriction to the pair of marginal subsystems is non-separable.

**22.    Dipole induced transparency in drop-filter cavity-waveguide systems**  
Edo Waks, Jelena Vuckovic  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510228  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a waveguide that is normally opaque due to interaction with a drop-filter cavity can be made transparent when the drop filter is also coupled to a dipole. A transparency condition is derived between the cavity lifetime and vacuum Rabi frequency of the dipole. This condition is much weaker than strong coupling, and amounts to simply achieving large Purcell factors. Thus, we can observe transparency in the weak coupling regime. We describe how this effect can be useful for designing quantum repeaters for long distance quantum communication.

**23.    QMA/qpoly Is Contained In PSPACE/poly: De-Merlinizing Quantum Protocols**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510230  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper introduces a new technique for removing existential quantifiers over quantum states. Using this technique, we show that there is no way to pack an exponential number of bits into a polynomial-size quantum state, in such a way that the value of any one of those bits can later be proven with the help of a polynomial-size quantum witness. We also show that any problem in QMA with polynomial-size quantum advice, is also in PSPACE with polynomial-size classical advice. This builds on our earlier result that BQP/qpoly is contained in PP/poly, and offers an intriguing counterpoint to the recent discovery of Raz that QIP/qpoly = ALL. Finally, we show that QCMA/qpoly is contained in PP/poly and that QMA/rpoly = QMA/poly.

Phys. Rev. A 73, 042304 (2006)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510235  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a simple protocol to purify a coherent-state superposition that has undergone a linear lossy channel. The scheme constitutes only a single beam splitter and a homodyne detector, and thus is experimentally feasible. In practice, a superposition of coherent states is transformed into a classical mixture of coherent states by linear loss, which is usually the dominant decoherence mechanism in optical systems. We also address the possibility of producing a larger amplitude superposition state from decohered states, and show that in most cases the decoherence of the states are amplified along with the amplitude.

We consider a class of one-dimensional chains of weakly coupled many level systems. We present a theory which predicts energy diffusion within these chains for almost all initial states, if some concrete conditions on their Hamiltonians are met. By numerically solving the time dependent Schroedinger equation, we verify this prediction. Close to equilibrium we analyze this behavior in terms of heat conduction and compute the respective coefficient directly from the theory.

We show their relevance to quantum chaos, by displaying quantum eigenfunctions of the quantum bakers map that are approximated well by such measures, thereby extending our recent work where we pointed to the existence of ``Thue-Morse'' states.
