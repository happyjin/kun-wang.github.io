**1.    On the class of languages recognizable by 1-way quantum finite automata**  
Andris Ambainis, Arnolds Kikusts, Maris Valdats  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0009004  
<blockquote>
<p>
It is an open problem to characterize the class of languages recognized by quantum finite automata (QFA). We examine some necessary and some sufficient conditions for a (regular) language to be recognizable by a QFA. For a subclass of regular languages we get a condition which is necessary and sufficient. Also, we prove that the class of languages recognizable by a QFA is not closed under union or any other binary Boolean operation where both arguments are significant.

**2.    Classical wave-optics analogy of quantum information processing**  
Robert J. C. Spreeuw  
Phys. Rev. A 63, 062302 (2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0009066  
<blockquote>
<p>
An analogous model system for quantum information processing is discussed, based on classical wave optics. The model system is applied to three examples that involve three qubits: ({\em i}) three-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement, ({\em ii}) quantum teleportation, and ({\em iii}) a simple quantum error correction network. It is found that the model system can successfully simulate most features of entanglement, but fails to simulate quantum nonlocality. Investigations of how far the classical simulation can be pushed show that {\em quantum nonlocality} is the essential ingredient of a quantum computer, even more so than entanglement. The well known problem of exponential resources required for a classical simulation of a quantum computer, is also linked to the nonlocal nature of entanglement, rather than to the nonfactorizability of the state vector.

**3.    A Family of Grover's Quantum Searching Algorithms**  
Alberto Galindo, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0009086  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concepts of Grover operators and Grover kernels to systematically analyse Grover's searching algorithms. Then, we investigate a one-parameter family of quantum searching algorithms of Grover's type and we show that the standard Grover's algorithm is a distinguished member of this family. We show that all the algorithms of this class solve the searching problem with an efficiency of order $O(\sqrt{N})$, with a coefficient which is class-dependent. The analysis of this dependence is a test of the stability and robustness of the algorithms. We show the stability of this constructions under perturbations of the initial conditions and extend them upon a very general class of Grover operators.

**4.    Gravitational Experiment Below 1 Millimeter and Comment on Shielded Casimir Backgrounds for Experiments in the Micron Regime**  
Joshua C. Long, Allison B. Churnside, John C. Price  
Proceedings of the Ninth Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity (World Scientific, 2002), part C, 1825-1826.  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0009062  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the status of an experimental test for gravitational strength forces below 1 mm. Our experiment uses small 1 kilohertz oscillators as test masses, with a stiff counducting shield between them to suppress backgrounds. At the present sensitivity of approximately 1000 times gravitational strength, we see no evidence for new forces with interaction ranges between 75 microns and 1 mm. While the Casimir background is not expected to be significant at this range, an extension of the shielding technique we employ may be useful for reducing this background in experiments below a few microns. We describe a possible implementation.
