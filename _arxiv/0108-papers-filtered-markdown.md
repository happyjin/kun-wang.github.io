**1.    Quantum walks in higher dimensions**  
Troy D. Mackay, Stephen D. Bartlett, Leigh T. Stephenson, Barry C. Sanders  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, 2745 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108004  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the quantum walk in higher spatial dimensions and compare classical and quantum spreading as a function of time. Tensor products of Hadamard transformations and the discrete Fourier transform arise as natural extensions of the quantum coin toss in the one-dimensional walk simulation, and other illustrative transformations are also investigated. We find that entanglement between the dimensions serves to reduce the rate of spread of the quantum walk. The classical limit is obtained by introducing a random phase variable.

**2.    Giant light shift of atoms near optical microstructures**  
Peter Horak, Peter Domokos, Helmut Ritsch  
Europhys. Lett. 61, 459 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108006  
<blockquote>
<p>
Atoms coupled to optical fields confined in one and two spatial dimensions in solid state microstructures can experience very large light shifts if the driving frequencies are close to a resonance of the microstructures and an atomic transition. Using the simple example of a quasi one-dimensional waveguide structure we can analytically calculate the atomic AC Stark shift and the modifications of the light field induced by the presence of the atom. A large enhancement of the effective interaction strength is found due to a non uniform mode density. Experimentally this should be visible by monitoring the scattered light field as well as by the modification of the atomic trajectories bouncing from the evanescent light.

**3.    Robustness of adiabatic quantum computation**  
Andrew M. Childs, Edward Farhi, John Preskill  
Phys.Rev. A65 (2002) 012322  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108048  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the fault tolerance of quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, a quantum algorithm for solving various combinatorial search problems. We describe an inherent robustness of adiabatic computation against two kinds of errors, unitary control errors and decoherence, and we study this robustness using numerical simulations of the algorithm.

**4.    Simple Scheme for Efficient Linear Optics Quantum Gates**  
T.C.Ralph, A.G.White, W.J.Munro, G.J.Milburn  
Physical Review A 65, 012314(2001)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108049  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe the construction of a conditional quantum control-not (CNOT) gate from linear optical elements following the program of Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [Nature {\bf 409}, 46 (2001)]. We show that the basic operation of this gate can be tested using current technology. We then simplify the scheme significantly.

**5.    Polarization Entanglement Purification using Spatial Entanglement**  
Christoph Simon, Jian-Wei Pan  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 257901 (2002)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108063  
<blockquote>
<p>
Parametric down-conversion can produce photons that are entangled both in polarization and in space. Here we show how the spatial entanglement can be used to purify the polarization entanglement using only linear optical elements. Spatial entanglement as an additional resource leads to a substantial improvement in entanglement output compared to a previous scheme. Interestingly, in the present context the thermal character of down-conversion sources can be turned into an advantage. Our scheme is realizable with current technology.

**6.    Optical quantum computer based on RDS crystal**  
Z. S. Sazonova, Ranjit Singh  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108065  
<blockquote>
<p>
We have proposed the construction of optical quantum computer (OQC) on regular domain structure (RDS) crystal. By using RDS crystal, we can perform all the logical operations on one RDS crystal. Moreover, RDS crystals are parctically independent to the heating effects i.e., can perform logic operations constantly without cooling the RDS crystal. Also, we have proposed the quantum parallelsim i.e., parallel coherent laser beams are injected at the input of the RDS crystals. By using the RDS crystal we can perform the reduce the requirements of the linear and nonlinear optical components.

**7.    Polarization squeezing and continuous-variable polarization entanglement**  
Natalia Korolkova, Gerd Leuchs, Rodney Loudon, Timothy C. Ralph, Christine Silberhorn  
Phys. Rev. A 65, 052306, (2002).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108098  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Stokes-parameter operators and the associated Poincare sphere, which describe the quantum-optical polarization properties of light, are defined and their basic properties are reviewed. The general features of the Stokes operators are illustrated by evaluation of their means and variances for a range of simple polarization states. Some of the examples show polarization squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller than the coherent-state value. The main object of the paper is the application of these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam formed by interference of two orthogonally-polarized quadrature-squeezed beams exhibits squeezing in some of the Stokes parameters. Passage of such a primary polarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair of polarization-entangled light beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed state. The use of pairs of primary polarization-squeezed light beams leads to substantially increased entanglement and to the generation of EPR-entangled light beams. The important advantage of these nonclassical polarization states for quantum communication is the possibility of experimentally determining all of the relevant conjugate variables of both squeezed and entangled fields using only linear optical elements followed by direct detection.

**8.    Why 3 + 1 metric rather than 4 + 0 or 2 + 2?**  
H. van Dam, Y. Jack Ng  
Phys.Lett. B520 (2001) 159-162  
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0108067  
<blockquote>
<p>
Why does the physical 4-dimensional space have a 3 + 1 signature rather than a 4 + 0 or a 2 + 2 for its metric? We give a simple explanation based largely on a group-theoretic argument a la Wigner. Applied to flat spaces of higher dimensions the same approach indicates that metrics with more than one time dimension are physically unacceptable because the corresponding irreducible unitary representations are infinite dimensional (besides the trivial representation).

**9.    Detection of QED vacuum nonlinearities in Maxwell's equations by the use of waveguides**  
Gert Brodin, Mattias Marklund, Lennart Stenflo  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 (2001) 171801  
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0108022  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a novel method for detecting nonlinearities, due to quantum electrodynamics through photon-photon scattering, in Maxwell's equation. The photon-photon scattering gives rise to self-interaction terms, which are similar to the nonlinearities due to the polarisation in nonlinear optics. These self-interaction terms vanish in the limit of parallel propagating waves, but if instead of parallel propagating waves the modes generated in wavesguides are used, there will be a non-zero total effect. Based on this idea, we calculate the nonlinear excitation of new modes and estimate the strength of this effect. Furthermore, we suggest a principal experimental setup.
