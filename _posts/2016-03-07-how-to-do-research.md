Well, this is really a big subject for me under the consideration that I am only evolved in academia with no more than three years. Here I try to record down how I do research, mainly how to find and read interested or related papers.

### How to Find and Organize Papers
In this stage I work with two softwares: [EndNote](http://endnote.com/) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). The typical working procedure is depicted as:   
**Step1.** Search for published papers on interested topics in [Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com/). *DO NOT* forget to save your search history and have a monthly-summary of the searched topics if you wanna catch up with the latest news.   
**Step2.** Export the searched results into EndNote, thus you can glimpse, keyword and note these papers anytime you like. In this step, paper will be filtered by its title, abstract, authors and publication journals. Some papers are worthy reading further, but most of them will be marked as *useless* and neglected forever.   
**Step3.** For papers that need further attention, I will copy them to Zotero, keep an detailed bibliography with electronic PDF attached. Then Why Zotero is used in this step instead of EndNote? There are following reasons:

1. There are tooooooo many papers in EndNote after **Step2**, hard to locate these valuable ones. So EndNote is only used for first-step filtration.
2. Zotero has a more *easy-to-use* keyword marking system, and its interface is more compact.
3. And most most important, I met Zotero *before* Endnote. As you can guess, I am used to Zotero.   

After the above three steps, there ain't that many papers left. What you have to do now is rather simple yet very time and brain consuming - READ THEM. This introduces next topic - How to read papers?

### How to Read Papers

In this stage I work with two softwares: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [MindManager](https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/), [PDF-XChange Editor](http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) and [Sumatra PDF](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). 
I prefer to take notes directly on the pdf. PDF-XChange Editor is enough for make notations, Sumatra PDF can open the same file while I am reading in PDF-XChange Editor. Whenever I read something interesting or worthy, I will excerpt it into the mindmanager, or Zotero notes.
