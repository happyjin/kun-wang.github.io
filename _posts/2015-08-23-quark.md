title: My Research Group - Quark

Well, actually I have no research group now, but it cannot stop me from wondering what my group name will be if I had one.

***Quark***, which means ***QUA***-ntum ***R***-esearch ***K***-alon, is an institute dedicated to the study of quantum computation, quantum information and other researches in quantum theory. 

Kalon, its definition is "ideal perfect beauty in the physical and moral sense, especially as perceived by Greek philosophers" ([Definition of Kalon][1]). I used it here to compliment the beauty and elegance of quantum computing.

A trademark is needed, anyone who interested please contacts me. It's really my great honor to hear from you.
