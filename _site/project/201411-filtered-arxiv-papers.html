    <p><strong>1.    Universal hyperparallel hybrid photonic quantum gates with dipole-induced transparency in the weak-coupling regime</strong><br>
Bao-Cang Ren, Guan-Yu Wang, Fu-Guo Deng<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 032328 (2015)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We present the dipole induced transparency (DIT) of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center embedded in a photonic crystal cavity coupled to two waveguides, and it is obvious with the robust and flexible reflectance and transmittance difference of circularly polarized lights between the uncoupled and the coupled cavities even in the bad cavity regime (the Purcell regime). With this DIT, we propose two universal hyperparallel hybrid photonic quantum logic gates, including a hybrid hyper-controlled-not gate and a hybrid hyper-Toffoli gate, on photon systems in both the polarization and the spatial-mode degrees of freedom (DOFs), which are equal to two identical quantum logic gates operating simultaneously on the systems in one DOF. They can be used to perform more quantum operations with less resources in the quantum information protocols with multi-qubit systems in several DOFs, which may depress the resources consumed and the photonic dissipation. Moreover, they are more robust against asymmetric environment noise in the weak-coupling regime, compared with the integration of two cascaded quantum logic gates in one DOF.

<p>
The problem of Hamiltonian purification introduced by Burgarth et al. [D. K. Burgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] is formalized and discussed. Specifically, given a set of non-commuting Hamiltonians {h1, . . ., hm} operating on a d-dimensional quantum system Hd, the problem consists in identifying a set of commuting Hamiltonians {H1,...,Hm} operating on a larger dE-dimensional system H_{dE} which embeds H_d as a proper subspace, such that hj = PHjP with P being the projection which allows one to recover Hd from HdE . The notions of spanning-set purification and generator purification of an algebra are also introduced and optimal solutions for u(d) are provided.

<p><strong>3.    Quantized recurrence time in iterated open quantum dynamics</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0568">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0568</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The expected return time to the original state is a key concept characterizing systems obeying both classical or quantum dynamics. We consider iterated open quantum dynamical systems in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, a broad class of systems that includes classical Markov chains and unitary discrete time quantum walks on networks. Starting from a pure state, the time evolution is induced by repeated applications of a general quantum channel, in each timestep followed by a measurement to detect whether the system has returned to the original state. We prove that if the superoperator is unital in the relevant Hilbert space (the part of the Hilbert space explored by the system), then the expectation value of the return time is an integer, equal to the dimension of this relevant Hilbert space. We illustrate our results on partially coherent quantum walks on finite graphs. Our work connects the previously known quantization of the expected return time for bistochastic Markov chains and for unitary quantum walks, and shows that these are special cases of a more general statement. The expected return time is thus a quantitative measure of the size of the part of the Hilbert space available to the system when the dynamics is started from a certain state.

<p><strong>4.    Distilling and protecting the single-photon entangled state</strong><br>
Lan Zhou, Yu-Bo Sheng<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0744">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0744</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose two efficient entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) for arbitrary less-entangled single-photon entanglement (SPE). Different from all the previous ECPs, these protocols not only can obtain the maximally SPE, but also can protect the single qubit information encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. These protocols only require one pair of less-entangled single-photon entangled state and some auxiliary single photons, which makes them economical. The first ECP is operated with the linear optical elements, which can be realized in current experiment. The second ECP adopts the cross-Kerr nonlinearities. Moreover, the second ECP can be repeated to concentrate the discard states in some conventional ECPs, so that it can get a high success probability. Based on above properties, our ECPs may be useful in current and future quantum communication.

We study dynamics of genuine entanglement for quantum states of three and four qubits under non-Markovian dephasing.

We compare dynamics of chosen quantum states with dynamics of random pure states and weighted graph states.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1779">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1779</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We identify gauge freedoms in quantum error correction (QEC) codes and introduce strategies for optimal control algorithms to find the gauges which allow the easiest experimental realization. Hereby, the optimal gauge depends on the underlying physical system and the available means to manipulate it. The final goal is to obtain optimal decompositions of QEC codes into elementary operations which can be realized with high experimental fidelities. In the first part of this paper, this subject is studied in a general fashion, while in the second part, a system of trapped ions is treated as a concrete example. A detailed optimization algorithm is explained and various decompositions are presented for the three qubit code, the five qubit code and the seven qubit Steane code.

<p><strong>7.    A Perturbative Approach to Continuous-Time Quantum Error Correction</strong><br>
Matteo Ippoliti, Leonardo Mazza, Matteo Rizzi, Vittorio Giovannetti<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 042322 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2285">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2285</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a novel discussion of the continuous-time quantum error correction introduced by Paz and Zurek in 1998 [Paz and Zurek, Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 355 (1998)]. We study the general Lindbladian which describes the effects of both noise and error correction in the weak-noise (or strong-correction) regime through a perturbative expansion. We use this tool to derive quantitative aspects of the continuous-time dynamics both in general and through two illustrative examples: the 3-qubit and the 5-qubit stabilizer codes, which can be independently solved by analytical and numerical methods and then used as benchmarks for the perturbative approach. The perturbatively accessible time frame features a short initial transient in which error correction is ineffective, followed by a slow decay of the information content consistent with the known facts about discrete-time error correction in the limit of fast operations. This behavior is explained in the two case studies through a geometric description of the continuous transformation of the state space induced by the combined action of noise and error correction.

<p><strong>8.    Security Issues Associated With Error Correction And Privacy Amplification In Quantum Key Distribution</strong><br>
Horace Yuen<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2310">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2310</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Privacy amplification is a necessary step in all quantum key distribution protocols, and error correction is needed in each except when signals of many photons are used in the key communication in quantum noise approach. No security analysis of error correcting code information leak to the attacker has ever been provided, while an ad hoc formula is currently employed to account for such leak in the key generation rate. It is also commonly believed that privacy amplification allows the users to at least establish a short key of arbitrarily close to perfect security. In this paper we show how the lack of rigorous error correction analysis makes the otherwise valid privacy amplification results invalid, and that there exists a limit on how close to perfect a generated key can be obtained from privacy amplification. In addition, there is a necessary tradeoff between key rate and security, and the best theoretical values from current theories would not generate enough near-uniform key bits to cover the message authentication key cost in disturbance-information tradeoff protocols of the BB84 variety.

<blockquote>
<p>
A precise measurement of dephasing over a range of timescales is critical for improving quantum gates beyond the error correction threshold. We present a metrological tool, based on randomized benchmarking, capable of greatly increasing the precision of Ramsey and spin echo sequences by the repeated but incoherent addition of phase noise. We find our SQUID-based qubit is not limited by $1/f$ flux noise at short timescales, but instead observe a telegraph noise mechanism that is not amenable to study with standard measurement techniques.

<p><strong>10.    Superconducting circuit boundary conditions beyond the Dynamical Casimir Effect</strong><br>
Jason Doukas, Jorma Louko<br>
Phys. Rev. D 91, 044010 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2948">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2948</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study analytically the time-dependent boundary conditions of superconducting microwave circuit experiments in the high plasma frequency limit, in which the conditions are Robin-type and relate the value of the field to the spatial derivative of the field. We give an explicit solution to the field evolution for boundary condition modulations that are small in magnitude but may have arbitrary time dependence, in a formalism that applies both to a semiopen waveguide and to a closed waveguide with two independently adjustable boundaries. The correspondence between the microwave Robin boundary conditions and the mechanically-moving Dirichlet boundary conditions of the Dynamical Casimir Effect is shown to break down at high field frequencies, approximately one order of magnitude above the frequencies probed in the 2011 experiment of Wilson et al. Our results bound the parameter regime in which a microwave circuit can be used to model relativistic effects in a mechanically-moving cavity, and they show that beyond this parameter regime moving mirrors produce more particles and generate more entanglement than their non-moving microwave waveguide simulations.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the driven-dissipative dynamics of a network of spin-1/2 systems coupled to one or more chiral 1D bosonic waveguides within the framework of a Markovian master equation. We determine how the interplay between a coherent drive and collective decay processes can lead to the formation of pure multipartite entangled steady states. The key ingredient for the emergence of these many-body dark states is an asymmetric coupling of the spins to left and right propagating guided modes. Such systems are motived by experimental possibilities with internal states of atoms coupled to optical fibers, or motional states of trapped atoms coupled to a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We discuss the characterization of the emerging multipartite entanglement in this system in terms of the Fisher information.

<p><strong>12.    A fast fault-tolerant decoder for qubit and qudit surface codes</strong><br>
Fern H.E. Watson, Hussain Anwar, Dan E. Browne<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3028">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3028</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The surface code is one of the most promising candidates for combating errors in large scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. A fault-tolerant decoder is a vital part of the error correction process---it is the algorithm which computes the operations needed to correct or compensate for the errors according to the measured syndrome, even when the measurement itself is error prone. Previously decoders based on minimum-weight perfect matching have been studied. However, these are computationally expensive and not immediately generalizable from qubit to qudit codes. In this work, we develop a fast fault-tolerant decoder for the surface code, capable of efficient operation for qubits and qudits of any dimension, generalizing the decoder first introduced by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200501 (2013)]. We study its performance when both the physical qudits and the syndromes measurements are subject to generalized uncorrelated bit-flip noise (and the higher dimensional equivalent). We show that, with appropriate enhancements to the decoder and a high enough qudit dimension, a threshold at an error rate of more than 8% can be achieved.

<p><strong>13.    Quantum Key Distribution over Combined Atmospheric Fading Channels</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3153">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3153</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we analyze a quantum communication scheme for entanglement-based continuous variable quantum key distribution between two ground stations. Communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels dominated by turbulence-induced beam wander. In this scheme the engineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers, with the satellite acting simply as a reflector. We show how the use of a highly selective post-selection strategy may lead to a useful quantum key generation rate for this system. This work represents the first quantitative assessment of continuous variable quantum key rates in the pragmatic scenario of reflection off low-earth-orbit satellites.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3160">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3160</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum correlation lies at the very heart of almost all the non-classical phenomena exhibited by quantum systems composed of more than one subsystem. In the recent days it has been pointed out that there exists quantum correlation, namely discord which is more general than entanglement. Some authors have investigated that for certain initial states the quantum correlations as well as classical correlation exhibit sudden change under simple Markovian noise. We show that, this dy- namical behavior of the both types of correlations can be explained using the idea of complementary correlations introduced in [arXiv:1408.6851]. We also show that though certain class of mixed en- tangled states can resist the monotonic decay of quantum correlations,it is not true for all mixed states. Moreover, pure entangled states of two qubits will never exhibit such sudden change.

<blockquote>
<p>
The interplay between non-Markovian dynamics and driving fields in the survival of entanglement between two non-degenerate oscillators is considered here. Based on exact analytical results for the non-Markovian dynamics of two parametrically coupled non-degenerate oscillators in contact to non-identical independent thermal baths, the out-of-equilibrium quantum limit derived in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 180501 (2010)] is generalized to the non-Markovian regime. Specifically, it is shown that non-Markovian dynamics, when compared to the Markovian case, allow for the survival of stationary entanglement at higher temperatures, with larger coupling strength to the baths and at smaller driving rates. The effect of the asymmetry of the (i) coupled oscillators, (ii) coupling strength to the baths at equal temperature and (iii) temperature at equal coupling strength is discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to navigate light signals in two-dimensional networks of waveguide arrays is a prerequisite for the development of all-optical integrated circuits for information processing and networking. In this article, we present a theoretical analysis of bending losses in linear photonic lattices with engineered couplings, and discuss possible ways for their minimization. In contrast to previous work in the field, the lattices under consideration operate in the linear regime, in the sense that discrete solitons cannot exist. The present results suggest that the functionality of linear waveguide networks can be extended to operations that go beyond the recently demonstrated point-to-point transfer of signals, such as blocking, routing, logic functions, etc.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3928">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3928</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dark and bright excitons are shown to appear naturally in a linear atomic super-lattice with two atoms per unit cell. In bringing the super-lattice into a strong coupling regime with a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide, bright excitons and photons are coherently mixed to form polaritons. Treating excitons as bosons implies a mechanism that forbids two excitations from being at the same atomic state, which is included here through a bosonization procedure with kinematic interactions. Interestingly these interactions couple dark and bright excitons, and which we exploit as a new tool for exciting dark states in a controllable way. We suggest a pump-probe experiment where two polaritons scatter into two dark excitons that found to be correlated and are represented as dark bogolon-excitons. The results can be adapted for any super-lattice of active materials, e.g., of organic molecules.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4248">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4248</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that universal holonomic quantum computation (HQC) can be achieved fault-tolerantly by adiabatically deforming the gapped stabilizer Hamiltonian of the surface code, where quantum information is encoded in the degenerate ground space of the system Hamiltonian. We explicitly propose procedures to perform each logical operation, including logical state initialization, logical state measurement, logical CNOT, state injection and distillation,etc. In particular, adiabatic braiding of different types of holes on the surface leads to a topologically protected, non-Abelian geometric logical CNOT. Throughout the computation, quantum information is protected from both small perturbations and low weight thermal excitations by a constant energy gap, and is independent of the system size. Also the Hamiltonian terms have weight at most four during the whole process. The effect of thermal error propagation is considered during the adiabatic code deformation. With the help of active error correction, this scheme is fault-tolerant, in the sense that the computation time can be arbitrarily long for large enough lattice size. It is shown that the frequency of error correction and the physical resources needed can be greatly reduced by the constant energy gap.

<blockquote>
<p>
Blind quantum computation allows a user to delegate a computation to an untrusted server while keeping the computation hidden. A number of recent works have sought to establish bounds on the communication requirements necessary to implement blind computation, and a bound based on the no-programming theorem of Nielsen and Chuang has emerged as a natural limiting factor. Here we show that this constraints only hold in limited scenarios and show how to overcome it using a method based on iterated gate-teleportations. We present our results as a family of protocols, with varying degrees of computational-ability requirements on the client. Certain protocols in this family exponentially outperform previously known schemes in terms of total communication. The approach presented here can be adapted to other distributed computing protocols to reduce communication requirements.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum data is susceptible to decoherence induced by the environment and to errors in the hardware processing it. A future fault-tolerant quantum computer will use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In the smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits. For each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed stabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing the encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and NV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at the end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable to physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for fault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the two parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit repetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We construct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using ancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating three-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate stabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to coherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits. While increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are required to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a critical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.

<p><strong>21.    Forrelation: A Problem that Optimally Separates Quantum from Classical Computing</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We achieve essentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexities. We do so using a property-testing problem called Forrelation, where one needs to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function. This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs ~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^{1/4} lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N^{1-1/2t})-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear. We conjecture that a natural generalization of Forrelation achieves the optimal t versus ~N^{1-1/2t} separation for all t. As a bonus, we show that this generalization is BQP-complete. This yields what&#39;s arguably the simplest BQP-complete problem yet known, and gives a second sense in which Forrelation &quot;captures the maximum power of quantum computation.&quot;

The spontaneous emission rate of a quantum dot coupled to a structured photonic reservoir is determined by the frequency dependence of its local density of photon states.

We present a polaron master equation model to calculate the photoluminescence intensity from a coherently excited quantum dot coupled to a structured photonic reservoir.

We report the first experimental demonstration of interference-induced spectral line elimination predicted by Zhu and Scully [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 388 (1996)] and Ficek and Rudolph [Phys. Rev. A 60, 4245 (1999)]. We drive an exciton transition of a self-assembled quantum dot in order to realize a two-level system exposed to bichromatic laser field and observe nearly complete elimination of the resonance fluorescence spectral line at the driving laser frequency. This is caused by quantum interference between coupled transitions among the doubly dressed excitonic states, without population trapping. We also demonstrate multiphoton ac Stark effect with shifted subharmonic resonances and dynamical modifications of resonance fluorescence spectra by using double dressing.

<p><strong>25.    History Dependent Quantum Walk on the Cycle with an Unbalanced Coin</strong><br>
Walter O. Krawec<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6298">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6298</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, a new model of quantum walk, utilizing recycled coins, was introduced; however little is yet known about its properties. In this paper, we study its behavior on the cycle graph. In particular, we will consider its time averaged distribution and how it is affected by the walk&#39;s &quot;memory parameter&quot; - a real parameter, between zero and eight, which affects the walk&#39;s coin flip operator. Despite an infinite number of different parameters, our analysis provides evidence that only a few produce non-uniform behavior. Our analysis also shows that the initial state, and cycle size modulo four all affect the behavior of this walk. We also prove an interesting relationship between the recycled coin model and a different memory-based quantum walk recently proposed.

<p>
Optical emitters strongly coupled to photons propagating in one-dimensional waveguides are a promising platform for building an optical quantum computer. Here, we present a theoretical study of the scattering of two indistinguishable photons on a single two-level atom in a Hong-Ou-Mandel set-up. By computing the dynamics, we can describe the system at any time of the scattering event. This allows us to highlight the one-to-one correspondence between the saturation of the atom and the effective interaction induced between the photons. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications for on-chip quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
To use quantum systems for technological applications we first need to preserve their coherence for macroscopic timescales, even at finite temperature. Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct errors that affect a quantum memory. An attractive scenario is the construction of passive storage of quantum information with minimal active support. Indeed, passive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology, physically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard disk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open problem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been devised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes. Here we review the state-of-the-art developments in this field in an informative and pedagogical way. We give the main principles of self-correcting quantum memories and we analyze several milestone examples from the literature of two-, three- and higher-dimensional quantum memories.

Daniel Bedingham, Hendrik Ulbricht<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6921">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6921</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Wavefunction collapse models modify Schr\&quot;odinger&#39;s equation so that it describes the collapse of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states as a dynamical process. This provides a basis for the resolution of the quantum measurement problem. An additional generic consequence of the collapse mechanism is that it causes particles to exhibit a tiny random diffusive motion. Here it is shown that for the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model---one of the most well developed collapse models---the diffusions of two sufficiently nearby particles are positively correlated. An experimental test of this effect is proposed in which random displacements of pairs of free nanoparticles are measured after they have been simultaneously released from nearby traps. The experiment must be carried out at sufficiently low temperature and pressure in order for the collapse effects to dominate over the ambient environmental noise. It is argued that these constraints can be satisfied by current technologies for a large region of the viable parameter space of the CSL model. The effect disappears as the separation between particles exceeds the CSL length scale. The test therefore provides a means of bounding this length scale.

An all-optical scheme for simulating non-Markovian evolution of a quantum system is proposed.

Various criteria for detecting non-Markovianity are also investigated by checking the dynamical evolution of the channel.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computing becomes viable when a quantum state can be preserved from environmentally-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation by guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical failure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition (QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits and a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of environmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the many exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer.

<p>
We derive an upper bound for the distinguishability-based non-Markovianity measure of a two-level system and prove that for certain master equations the exact value of the measure achieves this bound. Furthermore, we obtain an easily calculable lower bound for the divisibility-based non-Markovianity measure of an $n$-level system. We illustrate the calculation of these bounds through examples, considering in detail the spin-boson model. We show that the differences between the two measures in the spin-boson model are caused by the drift vector that is also responsible for the non-unitality of the dynamical map.

<blockquote>
<p>
We predict that all-optically reconfigurable generation of photon pairs with tailored spatial entanglement can be realized via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in integrated nonlinear coupled waveguides. The required elements of the output quantum wavefunction are directly mapped from the amplitudes and phases of the classical laser pump inputs in each waveguide. This is achieved through special nonuniform domain poling, which locally inverts the sign of quadratic nonlinear susceptibility and accordingly shapes the interference of biphoton quantum states generated along the waveguides. We demonstrate a device configuration for the generation of any linear combination of two-photon Bell states.

<blockquote>
<p>
The low energy continuum limit of graphene is effectively known to be modeled using Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensions. We consider the possibility of using modulated high frequency periodic driving of a two-dimension system (optical lattice) to simulate properties of rippled graphene. We suggest that the Dirac Hamiltonian in a curved background space can also be effectively simulated by a suitable driving scheme in optical lattice. The time dependent system yields, in the approximate limit of high frequency pulsing, an effective time independent Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution, except for an initial and a final kick. We use a specific form of 4-phase pulsed forcing with suitably tuned choice of modulating operators to mimic the effects of curvature. The extent of curvature is found to be directly related to $\omega^{-1}$ the time period of the driving field at the leading order. We apply the method to engineer the effects of curved background space. We find that the imprint of curvilinear geometry modifies the electronic properties, such as LDOS, significantly. We suggest that this method shall be useful in studying the response of various properties of such systems to non-trivial geometry without requiring any actual physical deformations.

We demonstrate an elastically-tunable self-assembled quantum dot in a nanowire antenna that emits single photons with resolution-limited spectral linewidths. The single-photon device is comprised of a single quantum dot embedded in a top-down fabricated nanowire waveguide integrated onto a piezoelectric actuator. Non-resonant excitation leads to static (fluctuating) charges likely at the nanowire surface, causing DC Stark shifts (inhomogeneous broadening); for low excitation powers, the effects are not observed and resolution-limited linewidths are obtained. Despite significant strain-field relaxation in the high-aspect-ratio nanowires, we achieve up to 1.2 meV tuning of a dot&#39;s transition energy. Single-photon sources with high brightness, resolution-limited linewidths, and wavelength tunability are promising for future quantum technologies.

The operators {O[R]} defined on R are shown to belong to the Universal Enveloping Algebra UEA[io(2)] allowing, in this way, their algebraic discussion.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks on translation invariant regular graphs spread quadratically faster than their classical counterparts. The same coherence that gives them this quantum speedup inhibits, or even stops their spread in the presence of disorder. We ask how to create an efficient transport channel from a fixed source site (A) to fixed target site (B) in a disordered 2-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk by cutting some of the links. We show that the somewhat counterintuitive strategy of cutting links along a single line connecting A to B creates such a channel. The efficient transport along the cut is due to topologically protected chiral edge states, which exist even though the bulk Chern number in this system vanishes. We give a realization of the walk as a periodically driven lattice Hamiltonian, and identify the bulk topological invariant responsible for the edge states as the quasienergy winding of this Hamiltonian.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable anyons in one-dimensional lattices with both on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions based on the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. It is shown that the two-body correlations in position space are symmetric about the initial sites of two quantum walkers in the Bose limit ($\chi=0$ ) and Fermi limit ( $\chi=1$), while in momentum space this happens only in the Bose limit. An interesting asymmetry arises in the correlation for most cases with the statistical parameter $\chi$ varying in between. It turns out that the origin of this asymmetry comes from the fractional statistics that anyons obey. On the other hand, the two-body correlations of hard-core anyons in position spaceshow uniform behaviors from anti-bunching to co-walking regardless of the statistical parameter. The momentum correlations in the case of strong interaction undergo a smooth process of two stripes smoothly merging into a single one, i.e. the evolution of fermions into hard-core bosons.

<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that, regardless of the choice of the angles $\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3$, three fractional Fourier transforms $F_{\theta_1}$, $F_{\theta_2}$ and $F_{\theta_3}$ do not solve the phase retrieval problem. That is, there do not exist three angles $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$ such that any signal $\psi\in L^2(R)$ could be determined up to a constant phase by knowing only the three intensities $|F_{\theta_1}\psi|^2$, $|F_{\theta_2}\psi|^2$ and $|F_{\theta_3}\psi|^2$. This provides a negative argument against a recent speculation by P. Jaming, who stated that three suitably chosen fractional Fourier transforms are good candidates for phase retrieval in infinite dimension. We recast the question in the language of quantum mechanics, where our result shows that any fixed triple of rotated quadrature observables $Q_{\theta_1}$, $Q_{\theta_2}$ and $Q_{\theta_3}$ is not enough to determine all unknown pure quantum states. The sufficiency of four rotated quadrature observables, or equivalently fractional Fourier transforms, remains an open question.

<blockquote>
<p>
In a system with chiral topological order, there is a remarkable correspondence between the edge and entanglement spectra: the low-energy spectrum of the system in the presence of a physical edge coincides with the lowest part of the entanglement spectrum (ES) across a virtual cut of the system, up to rescaling and shifting. In this paper, we explore whether the edge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically, we consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The unperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and entanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat and equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic calculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the effective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement cut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and H_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk topological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy spectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement the Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance along the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry enriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian space in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model, whose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT. This is achieved because the presence of the global symmetry implies that both Hamiltonians, in addition to being Z_2 symmetric, are Kramers-Wannier self-dual. Thus, the bulk topological order and the global translational symmetry of the Wen-plaquette model as a SET imply an edge-ES correspondence at least in some finite domain in Hamiltonian space.

<p>
We point out a connection between the emergence of bulk locality in AdS/CFT and the theory of quantum error correction. Bulk notions such as Bogoliubov transformations, location in the radial direction, and the holographic entropy bound all have natural CFT interpretations in the language of quantum error correction. We also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a &quot;quantum secret sharing scheme&quot;, and suggest a tensor network calculation that may settle the issue. Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard &quot;operator algebra quantum error correction&quot; of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of the idea of &quot;subregion-subregion&quot; duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its validity.

Finite width of the analog event horizon is determined by the nonlinearity length in the Kerr nonlinear optical system, which is discussed here, or by the healing length in Bose-Einstein condensates. The various eigen modes of fluctuations are found in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon and the scattering matrix due to the finite width horizon is calculated to within the leading order correction in the nonlinearity length. The Hawking radiation is found to be that of a grey body with the emissivity larger than one. A procedure of paraxial quantization of the fluctuation field is discussed and its connection to the conventional quantization of the electromagnetic field is demonstrated.
