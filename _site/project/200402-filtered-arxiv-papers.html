    <p><strong>1.    A practical scheme for error control using feedback</strong><br>
Mohan Sarovar, Charlene Ahn, Kurt Jacobs, Gerard J. Milburn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 69, 052324 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402017">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402017</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a scheme for quantum error correction that employs feedback and weak measurement rather than the standard tools of projective measurement and fast controlled unitary gates. The advantage of this scheme over previous protocols (for example Ahn et. al, PRA, 65, 042301 (2001)), is that it requires little side processing while remaining robust to measurement inefficiency, and is therefore considerably more practical. We evaluate the performance of our scheme by simulating the correction of bit-flips. We also consider implementation in a solid-state quantum computation architecture and estimate the maximal error rate which could be corrected with current technology.

<p><strong>2.    Dissipation in systems of linear and nonlinear quantum scissors</strong><br>
Adam Miranowicz, Wieslaw Leonski<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402024">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402024</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze truncation of coherent states up to a single-photon Fock state by applying linear quantum scissors, utilizing the projection synthesis in a linear optical system, and nonlinear quantum scissors, implemented by periodically driven cavity with a Kerr medium. Dissipation effects on optical truncation are studied in the Langevin and master equation approaches. Formulas for the fidelity of lossy quantum scissors are found.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum Theory of Fiber Bragg Grating Solitons</strong><br>
Ray-Kuang Lee, Yinchieh Lai<br>
J. Opt. B, 6, S638 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402033">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402033</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Following the pioneering work of Prof. Hermann A. Haus, a general quantum theory for bi-directional nonlinear optical pulse propagation problems is developed and applied to study the quantum properties of fiber Bragg grating solitons. Fiber Bragg grating solitons are found to be automatically amplitude squeezed after passing through the grating and the squeezing ratio saturates after a certain grating length. The optimal squeezing ratio occurs when the pulse energy is slightly above the fundamental soliton energy. One can also compress the soliton pulsewidth and enhance the squeezing simultaneously by using an apodized grating, as long as the solitons evolve adiabatically.

<p><strong>4.    Proposed magneto-electrostatic ring trap for neutral atoms</strong><br>
Asa Hopkins, Benjamin Lev, Hideo Mabuchi<br>
Physical Review A 70, 053616 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402037">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402037</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a novel trap for confining cold neutral atoms in a microscopic ring using a magneto-electrostatic potential. The trapping potential is derived from a combination of a repulsive magnetic field from a hard drive atom mirror and the attractive potential produced by a charged disk patterned on the hard drive surface. We calculate a trap frequency of [29.7, 42.6, 62.8] kHz and a depth of [16.1, 21.8, 21.8] MHz for [133Cs, 87Rb, 40K], and discuss a simple loading scheme and a method for fabrication. This device provides a one-dimensional potential in a ring geometry that may be of interest to the study of trapped quantum degenerate one-dimensional gases.

<p><strong>5.    Experimental demonstration of entanglement assisted coding using a two-mode squeezed vacuum state</strong><br>
Jun Mizuno, Kentaro Wakui, Akira Furusawa, Masahide Sasaki<br>
PHYSICAL REVIEW A 71, 012304 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402040">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402040</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We have experimentally realized the scheme initially proposed as quantum dense coding with continuous variables [Ban, J. Opt. B \textbf{1}, L9 (1999), and Braunstein and Kimble, \pra\textbf{61}, 042302 (2000)]. In our experiment, a pair of EPR (Einstein-Podolski-Rosen) beams is generated from two independent squeezed vacua. After adding two-quadrature signal to one of the EPR beams, two squeezed beams that contain the signal were recovered. Although our squeezing level is not sufficient to demonstrate the channel capacity gain over the Holevo limit of a single-mode channel without entanglement, our channel is superior to conventional channels such as coherent and squeezing channels. In addition, optical addition and subtraction processes demonstrated are elementary operations of universal quantum information processing on continuous variables.

<p><strong>6.    Nonlinear optical properties of electromagnetically-induced-transparency medium interacting with two quantized fields</strong><br>
Le-Man Kuang, Guang-Hong Chen, Yong-Shi Wu<br>
J.Optics B5 (2003) 341-348<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402041">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402041</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study linear and nonlinear optical properties of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium interacting with two quantized laser fields for adiabatic EIT case. We show that EIT medium exhibits normal dispersion. Kerr and higher order nonlinear refractive-index coefficients are also calculated in a completely analytical form. It is indicated that EIT medium exhibits giant resonantly enhanced nonlinearities. We discuss the response of the EIT medium to nonclassical light fields and find that the polarization vanishes when the probe laser is initially in a nonclassical state of no single-photon coherence.

<p><strong>7.    Non stabilizer Clifford codes with qupits</strong><br>
Hagiwara Manabu, Hideki Imai<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402060">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402060</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Clifford codes can be understood as a generalization of stabilizer codes. To show the existence of a true Clifford code which is better than any stabilizer code is a well known open problem in the theory of Clifford codes. One of the main difficulties in solving this problem is that we know only about 110 examples of codes which are Clifford but not stabilizer codes. In this paper, we obtain infinite examples of Clifford codes which are not stabilizer codes. We expect our examples to be useful in the study of Clifford codes.

This work deals with both instantaneous uniform mixing property and temporal standard deviation for continuous-time quantum random walks on circles in order to study their fluctuations comparing with discrete-time quantum random walks, and continuous- and discrete-time classical random walks.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum error correction for continuously detected errors with any number of error channels per qubit</strong><br>
Charlene Ahn, H. M. Wiseman, Kurt Jacobs<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 024302(BR) (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402067">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402067</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was shown by Ahn, Wiseman, and Milburn [PRA {\bf 67}, 052310 (2003)] that feedback control could be used as a quantum error correction process for errors induced by weak continuous measurement, given one perfectly measured error channel per qubit. Here we point out that this method can be easily extended to an arbitrary number of error channels per qubit. We show that the feedback protocols generated by our method encode $n-2$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, thus requiring just one more physical qubit than in the previous case.

We introduce a new method of storing visual information in Quantum Mechanical systems which has certain advantages over more restricted classical memory devices.

<p><strong>11.    Non-Markovian Quantum Trajectories Versus Master Equations: Finite Temperature Heat Bath</strong><br>
Ting Yu<br>
Phys. Rev. A 69, 062107 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402086">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402086</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The interrelationship between the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger equations and the corresponding non-Markovian master equations is investigated in the finite temperature regimes. We show that the general finite temperature non-Markovian trajectories can be used to derive the corresponding non-Markovian master equations. A simple, yet important solvable example is the well-known damped harmonic oscillator model in which a harmonic oscillator is coupled to a finite temperature reservoir in the rotating wave approximation. The exact convolutionless master equation for the damped harmonic oscillator is obtained by averaging the quantum trajectories relying upon no assumption of coupling strength or time scale. The master equation derived in this way automatically preserves the positivity, Hermiticity and unity.

<p><strong>12.    Feasibility of detecting single atoms using photonic bandgap cavities</strong><br>
Benjamin Lev, Kartik Srinivasan, Paul Barclay, Oskar Painter, Hideo Mabuchi<br>
Nanotechnology 15, S556 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402093">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402093</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an atom-cavity chip that combines laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms with magnetic microtraps and waveguides to deliver a cold atom to the mode of a fiber taper coupled photonic bandgap (PBG) cavity. The feasibility of this device for detecting single atoms is analyzed using both a semi-classical treatment and an unconditional master equation approach. Single-atom detection seems achievable in an initial experiment involving the non-deterministic delivery of weakly trapped atoms into the mode of the PBG cavity.

<p><strong>13.    Limitations of Quantum Advice and One-Way Communication</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402095">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402095</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although a quantum state requires exponentially many classical bits to describe, the laws of quantum mechanics impose severe restrictions on how that state can be accessed. This paper shows in three settings that quantum messages have only limited advantages over classical ones. First, we show that BQP/qpoly is contained in PP/poly, where BQP/qpoly is the class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial time, given a polynomial-size &quot;quantum advice state&quot; that depends only on the input length. This resolves a question of Buhrman, and means that we should not hope for an unrelativized separation between quantum and classical advice. Underlying our complexity result is a general new relation between deterministic and quantum one-way communication complexities, which applies to partial as well as total functions. Second, we construct an oracle relative to which NP is not contained in BQP/qpoly. To do so, we use the polynomial method to give the first correct proof of a direct product theorem for quantum search. This theorem has other applications; for example, it can be used to fix a flawed result of Klauck about quantum time-space tradeoffs for sorting. Third, we introduce a new trace distance method for proving lower bounds on quantum one-way communication complexity. Using this method, we obtain optimal quantum lower bounds for two problems of Ambainis, for which no nontrivial lower bounds were previously known even for classical randomized protocols.

<p><strong>14.    Quantum Logic Using Linear Optics</strong><br>
J.D. Franson, B.C. Jacobs, T.B. Pittman<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402097">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402097</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In order for quantum communications systems to become widely used, it will probably be necessary to develop quantum repeaters that can extend the range of quantum key distribution systems and correct for errors in the transmission of quantum information. Quantum logic gates based on linear optical techniques appear to be a promising approach for the development of quantum repeaters, and they may have applications in quantum computing as well. Here we describe the basic principles of logic gates based on linear optics, along with the results from several experimental demonstrations of devices of this kind. A prototype source of single photons and a quantum memory device for photons are also discussed. These devices can be combined with a four-qubit encoding to implement a quantum repeater.

<p><strong>15.    Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation For Local Non-Markovian Noise</strong><br>
Barbara M. Terhal, Guido Burkard<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402104">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402104</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a threshold result for fault-tolerant quantum computation for local non-Markovian noise models. The role of error amplitude in our analysis is played by the product of the elementary gate time t_0 and the spectral width of the interaction Hamiltonian between system and bath. We discuss extensions of our model and the applicability of our analysis.

<p><strong>16.    Coins Make Quantum Walks Faster</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, Alexander Rivosh<br>
Proc. 16th ACM-SIAM SODA, p. 1099-1108 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402107">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402107</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to search N items arranged on a $\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$ grid in time $O(\sqrt N \log N)$, using a discrete time quantum walk. This result for the first time exhibits a significant difference between discrete time and continuous time walks without coin degrees of freedom, since it has been shown recently that such a continuous time walk needs time $\Omega(N)$ to perform the same task. Our result furthermore improves on a previous bound for quantum local search by Aaronson and Ambainis. We generalize our result to 3 and more dimensions where the walk yields the optimal performance of $O(\sqrt{N})$ and give several extensions of quantum walk search algorithms for general graphs. The coin-flip operation needs to be chosen judiciously: we show that another ``natural&#39;&#39; choice of coin gives a walk that takes $\Omega(N)$ steps. We also show that in 2 dimensions it is sufficient to have a two-dimensional coin-space to achieve the time $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$.

<p><strong>17.    Feedback control of quantum state reduction</strong><br>
Ramon van Handel, John K. Stockton, Hideo Mabuchi<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Feedback control of quantum mechanical systems must take into account the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement. We formulate quantum feedback control as a problem of stochastic nonlinear control by considering separately a quantum filtering problem and a state feedback control problem for the filter. We explore the use of stochastic Lyapunov techniques for the design of feedback controllers for quantum spin systems and demonstrate the possibility of stabilizing one outcome of a quantum measurement with unit probability.

<p><strong>19.    Comments on &quot;Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation for Local Non-Markovian Noise&quot;</strong><br>
Robert Alicki<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the recent paper Terhal and Burkard derived a threshold result for fault-tolerant quantum computation under the assumption of the non-Markovian noise and claimed to rebut the objections rised by Alicki and Horodecki&#39;s. The purpose of this note is to show that the main condition used by Terhal and Burkard, although looking quite innocently, implies the assumption of the extremally low probability error per single quantum gate - p &lt; 10^{-8} - 10^{-12} - i.e. the square of the expected threshold value for the case of Markovian noise.

<p><strong>20.    Pseudo Memory Effects, Majorization and Entropy in Quantum Random Walks</strong><br>
Anthony J. Bracken, Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Tsohantjis<br>
J. Phys. A : Math. Gen. 37 (2004) L91-L97<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402187">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402187</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum random walk on the integers exhibits pseudo memory effects, in that its probability distribution after N steps is determined by reshuffling the first N distributions that arise in a classical random walk with the same initial distribution. In a classical walk, entropy increase can be regarded as a consequence of the majorization ordering of successive distributions. The Lorenz curves of successive distributions for a symmetric quantum walk reveal no majorization ordering in general. Nevertheless, entropy can increase, and computer experiments show that it does so on average. Varying the stages at which the quantum coin system is traced out leads to new quantum walks, including a symmetric walk for which majorization ordering is valid but the spreading rate exceeds that of the usual symmetric quantum walk.

<blockquote>
<p>
A method is introduced whereby two non-interacting quantum subsystems, that each interact with a third subsystem, are entangled via repeated projective measurements of the state of the third subsystem. A variety of physical examples are presented. The method can be used to establish long range entanglement between distant parties in one parallel measurement step, thus obviating the need for entanglement swapping.
