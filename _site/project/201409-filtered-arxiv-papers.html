    <p><strong>1.    Statistics-dependent quantum co-walking of two particles in one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable particles [bosons, fermions or hard-core bosons (HCBs)] in one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions. The results for two HCBs are well consistent with the recent experimental observation of two-magnon dynamics [Nature 502, 76 (2013)]. The two interacting particles can undergo independent- and/or co-walking depending on both quantum statistics and interaction strength. Two strongly interacting particles may form a bound state and then co-walk like a single composite particle with statistics-dependent walk speed. Analytical solutions for the scattering and bound states, which appear in the two-particle quantum walks, are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem in the two-particle Hilbert space. In the context of degenerate perturbation theory, an effective single-particle model for the quantum co-walking is analytically derived and the walk seep of bosons is found to be exactly three times of the ones of fermions/HCBs. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring quantum statistics via two-particle quantum walks.

<p><strong>2.    Asymmetric transmission through a flux-controlled non-Hermitian scattering center</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the possibility of asymmetric transmission induced by a non-Hermitian scattering center embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide, motivated by the aim of realizing quantum diode in a non-Hermitian system. It is shown that a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric non-Hermitian scattering center always has symmetric transmission although the dynamics within the isolated center can be unidirectional, especially at its exceptional point. We propose a concrete scheme based on a flux-controlled non-Hermitian scattering center, which comprises a non-Hermitian triangular ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux. The analytical solution shows that such a complex scattering center acts as a diode at the resonant energy level of the spectral singularity, exhibiting perfect unidirectionality of the transmission. The connections between the phenomena of the asymmetric transmission and reflectionless absorption are also discussed.

<p><strong>3.    Interactions Between Evanescent Photons and Environment</strong><br>
Moses Fayngold<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0885">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0885</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The evanescent waves named as EW1, EW2, EW3 are described in 3 respective experimental setups: 1) total internal reflection; 2) scattering on an inhomogeneous planar target; and 3) propagation along a waveguide. Some interactions are considered between EW2 and the environment. The latter may include a beam of probing particles and/or the screen on which the EW2 are formed. Some new properties of EW are described, such as complex energy eigenvalues in case of a movable screen, and evanescence exchange between the interacting objects. This reveals the connection between evanescent states and the Gamow states of the studied system. The 4-momentum exchange between EW2 and the probe is highly selective and may collapse the superposition of studied EW2- eigenstates to a single EW-eigenstate of the probing particle. Possible imprints of EW2 in the far field are briefly discussed and a simple experiment is suggested for their observation. .

<p><strong>4.    Scattering of two photons on a quantum emitter in a one-dimensional waveguide: Exact dynamics and induced correlations</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1256">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1256</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a wavefunction approach to describe the scattering of two photons on a quantum emitter embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide. Our method allows us to calculate the exact dynamics of the complete system at all times, as well as the transmission properties of the emitter. We show that the non-linearity of the emitter with respect to incoming photons depends strongly on the emitter excitation and the spectral shape of the incoming pulses, resulting in transmission of the photons which depends crucially on their separation and width. In addition, for counter-propagating pulses, we analyze the induced level of quantum correlations in the scattered state, and we show that the emitter behaves as a non-linear beam-splitter when the spectral width of the photon pulses is similar to the emitter decay rate.

<p><strong>5.    Unraveling the physics of topological phases with random walks of light</strong><br>
Graciana Puentes<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1273">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1273</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
I propose to study the complex physics of topological phases by an all optical implementation of a discrete-time quantum walk. The main novel ingredient is the use of parametric amplifiers in the random network which can in turn be used to emulate intra-atomic interactions and thus analyze many-body effects in topological phases even when using light as the quantum walker. I plan to characterize the intensity probability distribution and the spatial correlations of the output interference pattern for different input states, as well the robustness of localized boundary states characterizing topological insulators to different sources of noise. In particular, I expect to determine whether a non-local order parameter associated with a given topological entanglement measure can be determined in order to characterize topological order, and possible applications in entanglement topological protection. One of the most promising applications of the proposed research includes the study of topological phases in photosynthetic energy transferring processes characterizing biological systems.

<p>
We study quantum non-Markovianity in the early stage of the emission process of a two-level atom coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide, where the waveguide termination behaves as a perfect mirror. Specifically, we restrict to the analysis of the process for times shorter than twice the time delay t_d, where t_d is the duration of a round trip along the atom-mirror path. We show the emergence of a threshold in the parameters space separating the Markovian and non-Markovian regions.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1558">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1558</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the many-body scattering of non-interacting identical particles in mesoscopic chaotic cavities. A complete enumeration of all interfering paths allows us to discriminate single-particle effects from many-body interference due to quantum indistinguishability. In the thermodynamic limit of large particle number massive quantum interference results in a macroscopic, coherent manifestation of many-body correlations. We also incorporate mesoscopic dephasing, present even when the particles scatter simultaneously. Under further simplifications characteristic for optical scenarios, our methods can be used to address open issues related to the Boson Sampling problem.

<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) in random artificial electric and gravitational fields are studied analytically and numerically. The analytical computations are carried by a new method which allows direct exact analytical determination of the equations of motion obeyed by the average density operator. It is found that randomness causes the walks to decohere. Asymptotic diffusion coefficients are computed exactly. The continuous limit is also obtained and discussed.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum Apices: Identifying Limits of Entanglement, Nonlocality, &amp; Contextuality</strong><br>
Elie Wolfe<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2517">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2517</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This work develops analytic methods to quantitatively demarcate quantum reality from its subset of classical phenomenon, as well as from the superset of general probabilistic theories. Regarding quantum nonlocality, we discuss how to determine the quantum limit of Bell-type linear inequalities. In contrast to semidefinite programming approaches, our method allows for the consideration of inequalities with abstract weights, by means of leveraging the Hermiticity of quantum states. Recognizing that classical correlations correspond to measurements made on separable states, we also introduce a practical method for obtaining sufficient separability criteria. We specifically vet the candidacy of driven and undriven superradiance as schema for entanglement generation. We conclude by reviewing current approaches to quantum contextuality, emphasizing the operational distinction between nonlocal and contextual quantum statistics. We utilize our abstractly-weighted linear quantum bounds to explicitly demonstrate a set of conditional probability distributions which are simultaneously compatible with quantum contextuality while being incompatible with quantum nonlocality. It is noted that this novel statistical regime implies an experimentally-testable target for the Consistent Histories theory of quantum gravity.

<p><strong>10.    Ability of stabilizer quantum error correction to protect itself from its own imperfection</strong><br>
Yuichiro Fujiwara<br>
Physical Review A, 90 (2014) 062304<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2559">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2559</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The theory of stabilizer quantum error correction allows us to actively stabilize quantum states and simulate ideal quantum operations in a noisy environment. It is critical is to correctly diagnose noise from its syndrome and nullify it accordingly. However, hardware that performs quantum error correction itself is inevitably imperfect in practice. Here, we show that stabilizer codes possess a built-in capability of correcting errors not only on quantum information but also on faulty syndromes extracted by themselves. Shor&#39;s syndrome extraction for fault-tolerant quantum computation is naturally improved. This opens a path to realizing the potential of stabilizer quantum error correction hidden within an innocent looking choice of generators and stabilizer operators that have been deemed redundant.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the transport property of single photon scattered by a two-level system (TLS) in a T-shaped waveguide, which are made of an infinite coupled-resonator waveguide (CRW) and a semi-infinite CRW. The spontaneous emission of the TLS directs single photons form one CRW to the other. Although the transfer rate is different for the wave incident from different CRW, the transfer rate could be unit for the wave incident from the semi-infinite CRW due to the break of the translational symmetry by the presence of boundary.

<blockquote>
<p>
Efficient generation and detection of indistinguishable twin photons are at the core of quantum information and communications technology (Q-ICT). These photons are conventionally generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), which is a probabilistic process, and hence occurs at a limited rate, which restricts wider applications of Q-ICT. To increase the rate, one had to excite SPDC by higher pump power, while it inevitably produced more unwanted multi-photon components, harmfully degrading quantum interference visibility.Here we solve this problem by using recently developed 10 GHz repetition-rate-tunable comb laser, combined with a group-velocity-matched nonlinear crystal, and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. They operate at telecom wavelengths more efficiently with less noises than conventional schemes, those typically operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths generated by a 76 MHz Ti Sapphire laser and detected by Si detectors. We could show high interference visibilities, which are free from the pump-power induced degradation. Our laser, nonlinear crystal, and detectors constitute a powerful tool box, which will pave a way to implementing quantum photonics circuits with variety of good and low-cost telecom components, and will eventually realize scalable Q-ICT in optical infra-structures.

We consider the time dependent dynamics of an atom in a two-color pumped cavity, longitudinally through a side mirror and transversally via direct driving of the atomic dipole. The beating of the two driving frequencies leads to a time dependent effective optical potential that forces the atom into a non-trivial motion, strongly resembling a discrete random walk behavior between lattice sites. We provide both numerical and analytical analysis of such a quasi-random walk behavior.

However, if two qubits and more are disturbed, then the correction will depend on the used code.

Squeezing is a nonlinear Gaussian operation that is the key component in construction of other nonlinear Gaussian gates. In our implementation of the squeezing gate, the amount and the orientation of the squeezing can be controlled by an external driving signal with 1 MHz operational bandwidth. This opens a brand new area of dynamic Gaussian processing. In particular, the gate can be immediately employed as the feed-forward needed for the deterministic implementation of the quantum cubic gate, which is a key piece of universal quantum information processing.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum teleportation is a fundamental concept in quantum physics which now finds important applications at the heart of quantum technology including quantum relays, quantum repeaters and linear optics quantum computing (LOQC). Photonic implementations have largely focussed on achieving long distance teleportation due to its suitability for decoherence-free communication. Teleportation also plays a vital role in the scalability of photonic quantum computing, for which large linear optical networks will likely require an integrated architecture. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum teleportation in which all key parts - entanglement preparation, Bell-state analysis and quantum state tomography - are performed on a reconfigurable integrated photonic chip. We also show that a novel element-wise characterisation method is critical to mitigate component errors, a key technique which will become increasingly important as integrated circuits reach higher complexities necessary for quantum enhanced operation.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study how non-Markovianity of an open two-level system can be detected when continuously monitoring a part of its bosonic environment. Considering a physical scenario of an atom in a lossy cavity, we demonstrate that the properties of the time-dependent flux of the photons from the cavity allows the detection of memory effects in the atomic dynamics, without requiring state nor process tomography. This framework overlaps with effective descriptions for the memory part of the environment using pseudomode methods. Our central results show how the Markovian measurement record on the environment of an enlarged open system allows to draw conclusions on the non- Markovianity of the original system of interest.

<p><strong>19.    Quantum-information-theoretic approach to the signalling time of cryptochromes in Arabidopsis thaliana</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
An important problem in the magnetoreception of birds is the identification of a host molecule for a magnetically sensitive chemical reaction known as the radical-pair mechanism. Current experiments and theory suggest cryptochrome (a class of receptor molecules) as a viable candidate. Cryptochrome functions as a signalling molecule, triggering further chemical reactions that lead to a neural signal when it attains a certain population in a particular state. Here we characterise cryptochrome response times by proposing a simple model to describe its radical-pair reaction. A key element of the reaction is the quantum coherent oscillations between singlet and triplet spin states of the radicals. While this is essential for enabling the magnetic sensing of cryptochrome, coherent state transitions can also increase the speed of certain processes. By using the well-known formalism of Kraus maps from quantum information theory we study the influence of decoherence on how quickly cryptochrome can signal. In particular we describe the radical-pair reaction as a quantum random walk with a variable dephasing parameter for the singlet-triplet oscillations. This allows us to study the state transitions of the radical pair subject to different levels of decoherence. We find that for realistic system parameters (transition rates) obtained from the literature, dephasing induces a change in cryptochrome signalling times of only a few percent. We thus argue that the process is essentially robust to dephasing. This change is seen to occur over only a small window of dephasing noise strengths. Artificial (i.e. unrealistic) system parameters are also explored.

<p><strong>20.    Practical Topological Cluster State Quantum Computing Requires Loss Below 1%</strong><br>
Adam C. Whiteside, Austin G. Fowler<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The surface code cannot be used when qubits vanish during computation; instead, a variant known as the topological cluster state is necessary. It has a gate error threshold of $0.75% and only requires nearest-neighbor interactions on a 2D array of qubits. Previous work on loss tolerance using this code only considered qubits vanishing during measurement. We begin by also including qubit loss during two-qubit gates and initialization, and then additionally consider interaction errors that occur when neighbors attempt to entangle with a qubit that isn&#39;t there. In doing so, we show that even our best case scenario requires a loss rate below 1% in order to avoid considerable space-time overhead.

<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. Several studies have explored the integration of sources of entangled states on a silicon chip but the sources demonstrated so far require millimeter lengths and pump powers of the order of hundreds of mWs to produce an appreciable photon flux, hindering their scalability and dense integration. Microring resonators have been shown to be efficient sources of photon pairs, but entangled state emission has never been demonstrated. Here we report the first demonstration of a microring resonator capable of emitting time-energy entangled photons. We use a Franson experiment to show a violation of Bell&#39;s inequality by as much as 11 standard deviations. The source is integrated on a silicon chip, operates at sub-mW pump power, emits in the telecom band with a pair generation rate exceeding 10$^7$ Hz per $nm$, and outputs into a photonic waveguide. These are all essential features of an entangled states emitter for a quantum photonic networks.

<blockquote>
<p>
For a graph $G$ and a related symmetric matrix $M$, the continuous-time quantum walk on $G$ relative to $M$ is defined as the unitary matrix $U(t) = \exp(-itM)$, where $t$ varies over the reals. Perfect state transfer occurs between vertices $u$ and $v$ at time $\tau$ if the $(u,v)$-entry of $U(\tau)$ has unit magnitude. This paper studies quantum walks relative to graph Laplacians. Some main observations include the following closure properties for perfect state transfer: (1) If a $n$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer at time $\tau$ relative to the Laplacian, then so does its complement if $n\tau$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. As a corollary, the double cone over any $m$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer relative to the Laplacian if and only if $m \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. This was previously known for a double cone over a clique (S. Bose, A. Casaccino, S. Mancini, S. Severini, Int. J. Quant. Inf., 7:11, 2009). (2) If a graph $G$ has perfect state transfer at time $\tau$ relative to the normalized Laplacian, then so does the weak product $G \times H$ if for any normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $G$ and $\mu$ of $H$, we have $\mu(\lambda-1)\tau$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. As a corollary, a weak product of $P_{3}$ with an even clique or an odd cube has perfect state transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. It was known earlier that a weak product of a circulant with odd integer eigenvalues and an even cube or a Cartesian power of $P_{3}$ has perfect state transfer relative to the adjacency matrix. As for negative results, no path with four vertices or more has antipodal perfect state transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. This almost matches the state of affairs under the adjacency matrix (C. Godsil, Discrete Math., 312:1, 2011).

A randomly walking quantum particle evolving by Schr\&quot;odinger&#39;s equation searches on $d$-dimensional cubic lattices in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time when $d \ge 5$, and with progressively slower runtime as $d$ decreases. This suggests that graph connectivity (including vertex, edge, algebraic, and normalized algebraic connectivities) is an indicator of fast quantum search, a belief supported by fast quantum search on complete graphs, strongly regular graphs, and hypercubes, all of which are highly connected. In this paper, we show this intuition to be false by giving two examples of graphs for which the opposite holds true: one with low connectivity but fast search, and one with high connectivity but slow search. The second example is a novel two-stage quantum walk algorithm in which the walking rate must be adjusted to yield high search probability.

From the measured spatial distributions, we determine with good precision the amount of decoherence per step, which provides a quantitative indication of the quality of our quantum walks. In particular, we find that spin decoherence is the main mechanism responsible for the loss of coherence in our experiment. We also find that the sole observation of ballistic instead of diffusive expansion in position space is not a good indicator for the range of coherent delocalization. We provide further physical insight by distinguishing the effects of short and long time spin dephasing mechanisms. We introduce the concept of coherence length in the discrete-time quantum walk, which quantifies the range of spatial coherences. Unexpectedly, we find that quasi-stationary dephasing does not modify the local properties of the quantum walk, but instead affects spatial coherences. For a visual representation of decoherence phenomena in phase space, we have developed a formalism based on a discrete analogue of the Wigner function. We show that the effects of spin and spatial decoherence differ dramatically in momentum space.

<p>
Relations of simulated annealing and quantum annealing are studied by a mapping from the transition matrix of classical Markovian dynamics of the Ising model to a quantum Hamiltonian and vice versa. It is shown that these two operators, the transition matrix and the Hamiltonian, share the eigenvalue spectrum. Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not encounter a difficulty caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a first-order phase transition, the same is true for the corresponding process of quantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important differences between the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical mapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped to a short-range quantum system, but the converse mapping from a short-range quantum system to a classical one results in long-range interactions. This leads to a difference in efficiencies that simulated annealing can be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily true. We conclude that quantum annealing is easier to implement and is more flexible than simulated annealing. We also point out that the present mapping can be extended to accommodate explicit time dependence of temperature, which is used to justify the quantum-mechanical analysis of simulated annealing by Somma, Batista, and Ortiz. Additionally, an alternative method to solve the non-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional Ising model is provided through the classical-to-quantum mapping.

Computational evidence shows that, when using natural orbitals to study (dynamical and non-dynamical) electron correlation, determinants with an odd number of excitations play a negligible role.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a waveguide-cavity coupled system to achieve the routing of photons by the phases of other photons. Our router has four input ports and four output ports. The transport of the coherent-state photons injected through any input port can be controlled by the phases of the coherent-state photons injected through other input ports. This control can be achieved when the mean numbers of the routed and control photons are small enough and require no additional control fields. Therefore, the all-optical routing of photons can be achieved at the single-photon level.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial step towards long coherence times required for efficient quantum information processing (QIP). One major challenge in this direction concerns the fast real-time analysis of error syndrome measurements and the associated feedback control. Recent proposals on autonomous QEC (AQEC) have opened new perspectives to overcome this difficulty. Here, we design an AQEC scheme based on quantum reservoir engineering adapted to superconducting qubits. We focus on a three-qubit bit-flip code, where three transmon qubits are dispersively coupled to a few low-Q resonator modes. By applying only continuous-wave drives of fixed but well-chosen frequencies and amplitudes, we engineer an effective interaction Hamiltonian to evacuate the entropy created by eventual bit-flip errors. We provide a full analytical and numerical study of the protocol, while introducing the main limitations on the achievable error correction rates.

<p>
Deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1) is a restricted model of quantum computing where the input state is the completely mixed state except for a single clean qubit, and only a single output qubit is measured at the end of the computing. It is proved that the restriction of quantum computation to the DQC1 model does not change the complexity classes NQP and SBQP. As a main consequence, it follows that the DQC1 model cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses to the second level (more precisely, to AM), which answers the long-standing open problem posed by Knill and Laflamme under the very plausible complexity assumption. The argument developed in this paper also weakens the complexity assumption necessary for the existing impossibility results on classical simulation of various sub-universal quantum computing models, such as the IQP model and the Boson sampling.

Postulated by Pauli to explain the electronic structure of atoms and molecules, the exclusion principle establishes an upper bound of 1 for the fermionic natural occupation numbers ${n_i}$.

This has a strong potential impact on reduced density matrix functional theory as we know it. In this work we continue our study the nature of these inequalities for some atomic and molecular systems. The results indicate that (quasi)saturation of some of them leads to selection rules for the dominant configurations in configuration interaction expansions, in favorable cases providing means for significantly reducing their computational requirements.

<blockquote>
<p>
The determination of the computational complexity of the boson sampling problem with single boson sources has opened a novel research direction in the quantum computing field. Some research effort has also been devoted towards the use of different input sources where the sampling from the output distribution of a linear interferometer is still a complex task not achievable by a classical device. In this letter, we discuss the use of multi-mode thermal sources, based on a generalization of the boson sampling problem which relies on time-correlation measurements. We derive, for any possible sample, two equivalent formulations for the respective multi-boson correlation functions in terms of matrix permanents. The properties of these permanents emerging from the physics of multi-boson interference raise essential questions in the field of complexity theory. Our results are a manifestation of the physics behind correlated measurements in either photonic or atomic interferometers with bosonic thermal sources. This fascinating physics paves the way towards important applications not only in quantum computing but also in quantum metrology and quantum communication, by taking advantage of different kinds of bosonic sources.

<blockquote>
<p>
When the environment of an open quantum system is non-Markovian, amplitude and phase flow not only from the system into the environment but also back. Here we show that this feature can be exploited to carry out quantum control tasks that could not be realized if the system was isolated. Inspired by recent experiments on superconducting phase circuits, we consider an anharmonic ladder with resonant amplitude control only. This restricts realizable operations to SO(N). The ladder is immersed in an environment of two-level systems. Strongly coupled two-level systems lead to non-Markovian effects, whereas the weakly coupled ones result in single-exponential decay. Presence of the environment allows for implementing diagonal unitaries that, together with SO(N), yield the full group SU(N). Using optimal control theory, we obtain errors that are solely $T_1$-limited.

We show how to perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a Hamiltonian which describes a set of particles with local interactions on a two-dimensional grid. A single parameter in the Hamiltonian is adiabatically changed as a function of time to simulate the quantum circuit. We bound the eigenvalue gap above the unique groundstate by mapping our model onto the ferromagnetic XXZ chain with kink boundary conditions; the gap of this spin chain was computed exactly by Koma and Nachtergaele using its $q$-deformed version of SU(2) symmetry. We also discuss a related time-independent Hamiltonian which was shown by Janzing to be capable of universal computation. We observe that in the limit of large system size, the time evolution is equivalent to the exactly solvable quantum walk on Young&#39;s lattice.

<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) is one possible explanation for dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement. The collapse is mediated by a stochastic non-linear modification of the Schrodinger equation. A consequence of the CSL mechanism is an extremely tiny violation of energy-momentum conservation, which can, in principle, be detected in the laboratory via the random diffusion of a particle induced by the stochastic collapse mechanism. In a paper in 2003, Collett and Pearle investigated the translational CSL diffusion of a sphere, and the rotational CSL diffusion of a disc, and showed that this effect dominates over the ambient environmental noise at low temperatures and extremely low pressures (about ten-thousandth of a pico-Torr). In the present paper, we revisit their analysis and argue that this stringent condition on pressure can be relaxed, and that the CSL effect can be seen at the pressure of about a pico-Torr. A similar analysis is provided for diffusion produced by gravity-induced decoherence, where the effect is typically much weaker than CSL. We also discuss the CSL induced random displacement of a quantum oscillator. Lastly, we propose possible experimental set-ups justifying that CSL diffusion is indeed measurable with the current technology.

Non-classical two-photon temporal correlations with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 50 are measured without further off-chip filtering.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations between two qubits. Each qubit is implemented by a pair of phosphorous impurities embedded in a silicon substrate. The main decoherence mechanism affecting these types of qubits is provided by the coupling of the phosphorous impurities to the acoustical vibrations of the silicon lattice. We find that depending on the temperature of the substrate and the initial state, three different dynamics can be found. These are characterized by the number of abrupt changes in both classical and quantum correlations. We also show that the correlations do not disappear. Moreover, before the classical correlations reach a constant value, they may experience successive abrupt changes associated with the apparition of metastable pointer states basis. Then, a constant value for the classical correlations is reached when the preferred basis is established.

<p>
Hybrid qubit systems combining electronic spins with nearby (&quot;proximate&quot;) nuclear spin registers offer a promising avenue towards quantum information processing, with even multi-spin error correction protocols recently demonstrated in diamond. However, for the important platform offered by spins of donor atoms in cryogenically-cooled silicon,decoherence mechanisms of $^{29}$Si proximate nuclear spins are not yet well understood.The reason is partly because proximate spins lie within a so-called &quot;frozen core&quot; region where the donor electronic hyperfine interaction strongly suppresses nuclear dynamics. We investigate the decoherence of a central proximate nuclear qubit arising from quantum spin baths outside, as well as inside, the frozen core around the donor electron. We consider the effect of a very large nuclear spin bath comprising many ($\gtrsim 10^8$) weakly contributing pairs outside the frozen core. We also propose that there may be an important contribution from a few (of order $100$) symmetrically sited nuclear spin pairs (&quot;equivalent pairs&quot;), which were not previously considered as their effect is negligible outside the frozen core. If equivalent pairs represent a measurable source of decoherence, nuclear coherence decays could provide sensitive probes of the symmetries of electronic wavefunctions. For the phosphorus donor system, we obtain $T_{2n}$ values of order 1 second for both the &quot;far bath&quot; and &quot;equivalent pair&quot; models, confirming the suitability of proximate nuclei in silicon as very long-lived spin qubits.

<p>
Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion (NMQSD) has turned out to be an efficient method to calculate excitonic properties of aggregates composed of organic chromophores, taking into account the coupling of electronic transitions to vibrational modes of the chromophores. NMQSD is an open quantum system approach that incorporates environmental degrees of freedom (the vibrations in our case) in a stochastic way. We show in this paper that for linear optical spectra (absorption, circular dichroism) no stochastics is needed, even for finite temperatures. Thus, the spectra can be obtained by propagating a single trajectory. To this end we map a finite temperature environment to the zero temperature case using the so-called thermofield method. The resulting equations can then be solved efficiently by standard integrators.

<p>
At the core of an ideal single photon detector is an active material that ideally absorbs and converts photons to discriminable electronic signals. A large active material volume favours high-efficiency absorption, but often at the expense of conversion efficiency, noise, speed and timing accuracy. The present work demonstrates how the concept of coherent perfect absorption can be used to relax this trade-off for a waveguide-integrated superconducting nanowire single photon detector. A very short (8.5$\mu$m long) and narrow (8$\times$35nm$^2$) U-shaped NbTiN nanowire atop a silicon-on-insulator waveguide is turned into a perfect absorber by etching an asymmetric nanobeam cavity around it. At 2.05K, the detectors show $\sim$96$\pm$12% on-chip quantum efficiency for 1545nm photons with an intrinsic dark count rate $&lt;$0.1Hz. The estimated timing jitter is $\sim$53ps full-width at half-maximum and the reset time is $&lt;$7ns, both extrinsically limited by readout electronics. This architecture is capable of pushing ultra-compact detector performance to ideal limits, and so promises to find a myriad of applications in quantum optics.

Optically-detected magnetic resonance using Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) color centres in diamond is a leading modality for nanoscale magnetic field imaging, as it provides single electron spin sensitivity, three-dimensional resolution better than 1 nm, and applicability to a wide range of physical and biological samples under ambient conditions. To date, however, NV-diamond magnetic imaging has been performed using real space techniques, which are either limited by optical diffraction to 250 nm resolution or require slow, point-by-point scanning for nanoscale resolution, e.g., using an atomic force microscope, magnetic tip, or super-resolution optical imaging. Here we introduce an alternative technique of Fourier magnetic imaging using NV-diamond. In analogy with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we employ pulsed magnetic field gradients to phase-encode spatial information on NV electronic spins in wavenumber or k-space followed by a fast Fourier transform to yield real-space images with nanoscale resolution, wide field-of-view (FOV), and compressed sensing speed-up.

<p>
The deep sub-Ohmic spin-boson model shows a longstanding non-Markovian coherence at low temperature. Motivating to quench this robust coherence, the thermal effect is unitarily incorporated into the time evolution of the model, which is calculated by the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm combined with the orthogonal polynomials theory. Via introducing a unitary heating operator to the bosonic bath, the bath is heated up so that a majority portion of the bosonic excited states is occupied. It is found in this situation the coherence of the spin is quickly quenched even in the coherent regime, in which the non-Markovian feature dominates. With this finding we come up with a novel way to implement the unitary equilibration, the essential term of the eigenstate-thermalization hypothesis, through a short-time evolution of the model.

The copper provides a good path for thermalizing the cavity walls and qubit chip, although the substantial cavity loss makes conventional dispersive qubit measurements challenging. We are exploring various approaches for improving the quality factor of three-dimensional copper cavities, including electropolishing and coating with superconducting layers of tin.

We report the use of novel, capacitively terminated coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators to measure the quadratic Stark shift of phosphorus donor qubits in Si. We confirm that valley repopulation leads to an anisotropic spin-orbit Stark shift depending on electric and magnetic field orientations relative to the Si crystal. By measuring the linear Stark effect, we estimate the effective electric field due to strain in our samples. We show that in the presence of this strain, electric-field sources of decoherence can be non-negligible. Using our measured values for the Stark shift, we predict magnetic fields for which the spin-orbit Stark effect cancels the hyperfine Stark effect, suppressing decoherence from electric-field noise. We discuss the limitations of these noise-suppression points due to random distributions of strain and propose a method for overcoming them.
