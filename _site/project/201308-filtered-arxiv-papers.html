    <p><strong>1.    Data Structures in Classical and Quantum Computing</strong><br>
Maximilian Fillinger<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
This survey summarizes several results about quantum computing related to (mostly static) data structures. First, we describe classical data structures for the set membership and the predecessor search problems: Perfect Hash tables for set membership by Fredman, Koml\&#39;{o}s and Szemer\&#39;{e}di and a data structure by Beame and Fich for predecessor search. We also prove results about their space complexity (how many bits are required) and time complexity (how many bits have to be read to answer a query). After that, we turn our attention to classical data structures with quantum access. In the quantum access model, data is stored in classical bits, but they can be accessed in a quantum way: We may read several bits in superposition for unit cost. We give proofs for lower bounds in this setting that show that the classical data structures from the first section are, in some sense, asymptotically optimal - even in the quantum model. In fact, these proofs are simpler and give stronger results than previous proofs for the classical model of computation. The lower bound for set membership was proved by Radhakrishnan, Sen and Venkatesh and the result for the predecessor problem by Sen and Venkatesh. Finally, we examine fully quantum data structures. Instead of encoding the data in classical bits, we now encode it in qubits. We allow any unitary operation or measurement in order to answer queries. We describe one data structure by de Wolf for the set membership problem and also a general framework using fully quantum data structures in quantum walks by Jeffery, Kothari and Magniez.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum frequency conversion of quantum memory compatible photons to telecommunication wavelengths</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We report an experiment demonstrating quantum frequency conversion of weak light pulses compatible with atomic quantum memories to telecommunication wavelengths. We use a PPLN nonlinear waveguide to convert weak coherent states at the single photon level with a duration of 30ns from a wavelength of 780nm to 1552nm. We measure a maximal waveguide internal (external) conversion efficiency eta_int = 0.41 (eta_ext = 0.25), and we show that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is good enough to reduce the input photon number below 1. In addition, we show that the noise generated by the pump beam in the crystal is proportional to the spectral bandwidth of the device, suggesting that narrower filtering could significantly increase the SNR. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum frequency converter can operate in the quantum regime by converting a time-bin qubit and measuring the qubit fidelity after conversion.

<p>
We explore theoretically the single-photon transport in a single-mode waveguide that is coupled to a hybrid atom-optomechanical system in a strong optomechanical coupling regime. Using a full quantum real-space approach, transmission and reflection coefficients of the propagating single-photon in the waveguide are ob- tained. The influences of atom-cavity detuning and the dissipation of atom on the transport are also studied. Intriguingly, the obtained spectral features can reveal the strong light-matter interaction in this hybrid system.

<p><strong>5.    The computational power of matchgates and the XY interaction on arbitrary graphs</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1463">http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1463</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Matchgates are a restricted set of two-qubit gates known to be classically simulable when acting on nearest-neighbor qubits on a path, but universal for quantum computation when the qubits are arranged on certain other graphs. Here we characterize the power of matchgates acting on arbitrary graphs. Specifically, we show that they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and that they are classically simulable on a cycle. We also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction, a proper subset of matchgates related to some implementations of quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
Broadband light sources play essential roles in diverse fields, such as high-capacity optical communications, optical coherence tomography, optical spectroscopy, and spectrograph calibration. Though an ultrabroadband nonclassical state from standard spontaneous parametric down-conversion may serve as a quantum counterpart, its detection and quantum characterization have been a challenging task. Here we demonstrate the quantitative characterization of a multimode structure in such an ultrabroadband (150 nm FWHM) squeezed state at telecom wavelength (1.5 \mu m). The nonclassical photon distribution of our highly multimode state is directly observed using a superconducting transition-edge sensor. From the observed photon correlation functions, we show that several tens of different squeezers are coexisting in the same spatial mode. We anticipate our results and technique open up a new possibility to generate and characterize nonclassical light sources for a large-scale optical quantum network in the frequency domain.

<p><strong>7.    Waveguide QED: controllable channel from quantum interference</strong><br>
Qiong Li, Lan Zhou, C. P. Sun<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2011">http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2011</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a waveguide QED system with a rectangular waveguide and a two-level system (TLS) inside, where the transverse modes TMmn define the quantum channels of guided photons. It is discovered that the loss of photons in the TM11 channel into the others can be overcome by replacing it with a certain coherent superposition of TMmn channels, which is named as the controllable channel (CC) as the photons in CC can be perfectly reflected or transmitted by the TLS, and never lost into the other channels. The dark state emerges when the photon is incident from one of the scattering-free channels (SFCs) orthogonal to CC. The underlying physics mechanism is the multi-channel interference associated with Fano resonance.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to nondestructively detect the presence of a single, traveling photon has been a long-standing goal in optics, with applications in quantum information and measurement. Realising such a detector is complicated by the fact that photon-photon interactions are typically very weak. At microwave frequencies, very strong effective photon-photon interactions in a waveguide have recently been demonstrated. Here we show how this type of interaction can be used to realize a quantum nondemolition measurement of a single propagating microwave photon. The scheme we propose uses a chain of solid-state 3-level systems (transmons), cascaded through circulators which suppress photon backscattering. Our theoretical analysis shows that microwave-photon detection with fidelity around 90% can be realized with existing technologies.

We derive the time-dependent photo-detection probability equation of a superconducting single photon detector (SSPD) to study the responsive property for a pulse train at high repetition rate. Using this equation, we analyze the characteristics of SSPDs when illuminated by bright pulses in blinding attack on a quantum key distribution (QKD). We obtain good agreement between expected values based on our equation and actual experimental values. Such a time-dependent probability analysis contributes to security analysis.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce and discuss a set of tunable two-mode states of continuous-variable systems, as well as an efficient scheme for their experimental generation. This novel class of tunable entangled resources is defined by a general ansatz depending on two experimentally adjustable parameters. It is very ample and flexible as it encompasses Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian states. The latter include, among others, known states such as squeezed number states and de-Gaussified photon-added and photon-subtracted squeezed states, the latter being the most efficient non-Gaussian resources currently available in the laboratory. Moreover, it contains the classes of squeezed Bell states and even more general non-Gaussian resources that can be optimized according to the specific quantum technological task that needs to be realized. The proposed experimental scheme exploits linear optical operations and photon detections performed on a pair of uncorrelated two--mode Gaussian squeezed states. The desired non-Gaussian state is then realized via ancillary squeezing and conditioning. Two independent, freely tunable experimental parameters can be exploited to generate different states and to optimize the performance in implementing a given quantum protocol. As a concrete instance, we analyze in detail the performance of different states considered as resources for the realization of quantum teleportation in realistic conditions. For the fidelity of teleportation of an unknown coherent state, we show that the resources associated to the optimized parameters outperform, in a significant range of experimental values, both Gaussian twin beams and photon-subtracted squeezed states.

<blockquote>
<p>
Sending multiple messages on qubits encoded in different vibrational modes of cold atoms or ions along a transmission waveguide requires to merge first and then separate the modes at input and output ends. Similarly, different qubits can be stored in the modes of a trap and be separated later. We design the fast splitting of a harmonic trap into an asymmetric double well so that the initial ground vibrational state becomes the ground state of one of two final wells, and the initial first excited state becomes the ground state of the other well. This might be done adiabatically by slowly deforming the trap. We speed up the process by inverse engineering a double-function trap using dynamical invariants. The separation (demultiplexing) followed by an inversion of the asymmetric bias and then by the reverse process (multiplexing) provides a population inversion protocol based solely on trap reshaping.

<blockquote>
<p>
For many open quantum systems, a master equation approach employing the Markov approximation cannot reliably describe the dynamical behaviour. This is the case, for example, in a number of solid state or biological systems, and it has motivated a line of research aimed at quantifying the amount of non-Markovian behaviour in a given model. Within this framework, we investigate the dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a bosonic bath. We focus on Gaussian states, which are suitably treated using a covariance matrix approach. Concentrating on an entanglement based non-Markovian behaviour quantifier (NMBQ) proposed by Rivas et. al. [1], we consider the role that near resonant and off-resonant modes play in affecting the NMBQ. By using a large but finite bath of oscillators for both Ohmic and super Ohmic spectral densities we find, by systematically increasing the coupling strength, initially the near resonant modes provide the most significant non-Markovian effects, while after a certain threshold of coupling strength the off-resonant modes play the dominant role. We also consider the NMBQ for two other models where we add a single strongly coupled oscillator to the model in extra bath mode and &#39;buffer&#39; configurations, which affects the modes that determine non-Markovian behaviour.

<blockquote>
<p>
The future progress of semi-device independent quantum information science depends crucially on our ability to bound the strength of the nonlocal correlations achievable with finite dimensional quantum resources. In this work, we characterize quantum nonlocality under local dimension constraints via a complete hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations. In the bipartite case, we find that the first level of the hierarchy returns non-trivial bounds in all cases considered, allowing to study nonlocality scenarios with four measurement settings on one side and twelve (12) on the other in a normal desktop. In the tripartite case, we apply the hierarchy to derive a Bell-type inequality that can only be violated when each of the three parties has local dimension greater than two, hence certifying three-dimensional tripartite entanglement in a device independent way. Finally, we show how the new method can be trivially modified to detect non-separable measurements in two-qubit scenarios.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general formalism to describe continuous-variable (CV) quantum teleportation of discrete-variable (DV) states with gain tuning, taking into account experimental imperfections. Here the teleportation output is given by independently transforming each density matrix element of the initial state. This formalism allows us to accurately model various teleportation experiments and to analyze the gain dependence of their respective figures of merit. We apply our formalism to the recent experiment of CV teleportation of qubits [S. Takeda et al., Nature 500, 315 (2013)] and investigate the optimal gain for the transfer fidelity. We also propose and model an experiment for CV teleportation of DV entanglement. It is shown that, provided the experimental losses are within a certain range, DV entanglement can be teleported for any non-zero squeezing by optimally tuning the gain.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates. In this context the T gate has a special status since it confers universal computation when added to the (classically simulable) Clifford gates. However it can be very expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. We therefore view this gate as a resource which should be used only when necessary. Given an n-qubit unitary U we are interested in computing a circuit that implements it using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to decide if the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem as a function of N=2^n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which solves it using time and space both upper bounded as O(N^m poly(m,N)). We implemented our algorithm and used it to show that any Clifford+T circuit for the Toffoli or the Fredkin gate requires at least 7 T gates. This implies that the known 7 T gate circuits for these gates are T-optimal. We also provide a simple expression for the T-count of single-qubit unitaries.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present analytic estimates of the performances of various approximate quantum error correction schemes for the generalized amplitude damping (GAD) qubit channel. Specifically, we consider both stabilizer and nonadditive quantum codes. The performance of such error-correcting schemes is quantified by means of the entanglement fidelity as a function of the damping probability and the non-zero environmental temperature. The recovery scheme employed throughout our work applies, in principle, to arbitrary quantum codes and is the analogue of the perfect Knill-Laflamme recovery scheme adapted to the approximate quantum error correction framework for the GAD error model. We also analytically recover and/or clarify some previously known numerical results in the limiting case of vanishing temperature of the environment, the well-known traditional amplitude damping channel. In addition, our study suggests that degenerate stabilizer codes and self-complementary nonadditive codes are especially suitable for the error correction of the GAD noise model. Finally, comparing the properly normalized entanglement fidelities of the best performant stabilizer and nonadditive codes characterized by the same length, we show that nonadditive codes outperform stabilizer codes not only in terms of encoded dimension but also in terms of entanglement fidelity.

Quantum information can be protected from decoherence and other errors, but only if these errors are sufficiently rare. For quantum computation to become a scalable technology, practical schemes for quantum error correction that can tolerate realistically high error rates will be necessary. In some physical systems, errors may exhibit a characteristic structure that can be carefully exploited to improve the efficacy of error correction. Here, we describe a scheme for topological quantum error correction to protect quantum information from a dephasing-biased error model, where we combine a repetition code with a topological cluster state. We find that the scheme tolerates error rates of up to 1.37%-1.83% per gate, requiring only short-range interactions in a two-dimensional array.

<p>
Cryptography&#39;s importance in our everyday lives continues to grow in our increasingly digital world. Oblivious transfer (OT) has long been a fundamental and important cryptographic primitive since it is known that general two-party cryptographic tasks can be built from this basic building block. Here we show the experimental implementation of a 1-2 random oblivious transfer (ROT) protocol by performing measurements on polarization-entangled photon pairs in a modified entangled quantum key distribution system, followed by all of the necessary classical post-processing including one-way error correction. We successfully exchange a 1,366 bits ROT string in ~3 min and include a full security analysis under the noisy storage model, accounting for all experimental error rates and finite size effects. This demonstrates the feasibility of using today&#39;s quantum technologies to implement secure two-party protocols.

<p>
Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) represents a powerful and flexible framework for quantum information processing, based on the notion of entangled quantum states as computational resources. The most prominent application is the one-way quantum computer, with the cluster state as its universal resource. Here we demonstrate the principles of MBQC using deterministically generated graph states of up to 7 qubits, in a system of trapped atomic ions. Firstly we implement a universal set of operations for quantum computing. Secondly we demonstrate a family of measurement-based quantum error correction codes, and show their improved performance as the code length is increased. We show that all our graph states violate a multipartite Bell inequality and are therefore capable of information processing tasks that cannot be described by a local hidden variable model. The methods presented can directly be scaled up to generate graph states of several tens of qubits.

Eigenvalues of a density matrix characterize well the quantum state&#39;s properties, such as coherence and entanglement.

We propose a simple implementation scheme of quantum delayed-choice experiment in linear optical system without initial entanglement resource. By choosing different detecting devices, one can selectively observe the photon&#39;s different behaviors after the photon has been passed the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The scheme shows that the photon&#39;s wave behavior and particle behavior can be observed with a single experimental setup by postselection, that is, the photon can show the superposition behavior of wave and particle. Especially, we compare the wave-particle superposition behavior and the wave-particle mixture behavior in detail, and find the quantum interference effect between wave and particle behavior, which may be helpful to reveal the nature of photon essentially.

We consider the problem of calculating the logical error probability for a stabilizer quantum code subject to random Pauli errors. To access the regime of large code distances where logical errors are extremely unlikely we adopt the splitting method widely used in Monte Carlo simulations of rare events and Bennett&#39;s acceptance ratio method for estimating the free energy difference between two canonical ensembles. To illustrate the power of these methods in the context of error correction, we calculate the logical error probability $P_L$ for the 2D surface code on a square lattice with a pair of holes for all code distances $d\le 20$ and all error rates $p$ below the fault-tolerance threshold. Our numerical results confirm the expected exponential decay $P_L\sim \exp{[-\alpha(p)d]}$ and provide a simple fitting formula for the decay rate $\alpha(p)$. Both noiseless and noisy syndrome readout circuits are considered.

<blockquote>
<p>
The optimization of dynamical decoupling and quantum error correction for a particular qubit realization is based on a detailed knowledge of the noise properties. Spectroscopy of single-axis noise using dynamical decoupling pulse sequences has garnered much recent attention. Here we consider noise spectroscopy based on a spin-locking type pulse sequence, i.e. a continuous-wave (CW) on-resonance driving field. We show that a heuristic filter function approach produces a qualitatively correct (but quantitatively incorrect) result, whereas a 0th-order average Hamiltonian calculation is shown to agree with the result predicted by the generalized Bloch equations. We further calculate up to 2nd-order average Hamiltonian corrections and show the deviation from the generalized Bloch equation result. This shows that noise spectroscopy using continuous fields, in some cases simpler to implement and more robust to errors than pulsed schemes, can be rigorously analyzed and criteria for reliable measurements can be established. Finally, a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiment is presented which demonstrates that the CW and pulsed methods agree within experimental error. The noise, due to magnetization fluctuations in a dipolar coupled proton spin bath, is found to obey a roughly 1/\omega\ power law decay in the range of frequencies \omega\ investigated.

<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum optics a pure state is considered classical, relative to the statistics of photodetection, if and only if it is a coherent state. A different and newer notion of nonclassicality is based on modal entanglement. One example that relates these two notions is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where modal entanglement is generated by a beamsplitter from the nonclassical photon-number state. This suggests that beamsplitters or, more generally, linear-optical networks are mediators of the two notions of nonclassicality. In this Brief Report, we show the following: Given a nonclassical pure-product-state input to an N-port linear-optical network, the output is almost always mode entangled; the only exception is a product of squeezed states, all with the same squeezing strength, input to a network that does not mix the squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures. Our work thus gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear network to generate modal entanglement from pure product inputs, a result that is of immediate relevance to the boson sampling problem.

<blockquote>
<p>
Three-wave mixing in second-order nonlinear optical processes cannot occur in atomic systems due to the electric-dipole selection rules. In contrast, we demonstrate that second-order nonlinear processes can occur in a superconducting quantum circuit (i.e., a superconducting artificial atom) when the inversion symmetry of the potential energy is broken by simply changing the applied magnetic flux. In particular, we show that difference- and sum-frequencies (and second harmonics) can be generated in the microwave regime in a controllable manner by using a single three-level superconducting flux quantum circuit (SFQC). For our proposed parameters, the frequency tunability of this circuit can be achieved in the range of about 17 GHz for the sum-frequency generation, and around 42 GHz (or 26 GHz) for the difference-frequency generation. Our proposal provides a simple method to generate second-order nonlinear processes within current experimental parameters of SFQCs.

<blockquote>
<p>
We provide an analysis of a new family of device independent quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols with several novel features: (a) The bits used for the secret key do not come from the results of the measurements on an entangled state but from the choices of settings; (b) Instead of a single security parameter (a violation of some Bell inequality) a set of them is used to estimate the level of trust in the secrecy of the key. The main advantage of these protocols is a smaller vulnerability to imperfect random number generators made possible by feature (a). We prove the security and the robustness of such protocols. We show that using our method it is possible to construct a QKD protocol which retains its security even if the source of randomness used by communicating parties is strongly biased. As a proof of principle, an explicit example of a protocol based on the Hardy&#39;s paradox is presented. Moreover, in the noiseless case, the protocol is secure in a natural way against any type of memory attack, and thus allows to reuse the device in subsequent rounds. We also analyse the robustness of the protocol using semi-definite programming methods. Finally, we present a post-processing method, and observe a paradoxical property that rejecting some random part of the private data can increase the key rate of the protocol.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a general framework to effectively <code>open&#39; a high-Q resonator, that is, to release the quantum state initially prepared in it in the form of a traveling electromagnetic wave. This is achieved by employing a mediating mode that scatters coherently the radiation from the resonator into a one-dimensional continuum of modes such as a waveguide. The same mechanism may be used to</code>feed&#39; a desired quantum field to an initially empty cavity. Switching between an <code>open&#39; and</code>closed&#39; resonator may then be obtained by controlling either the detuning of the scatterer or the amount of time it spends in the resonator. First, we introduce the model in its general form, identifying (i) the traveling mode that optimally retains the full quantum information of the resonator field and (ii) a suitable figure of merit that we study analytically in terms of the system parameters. Then, we discuss two feasible implementations based on ensembles of two-level atoms interacting with cavity fields. In addition, we discuss how to integrate traditional cavity QED in our proposal using three-level atoms.

<blockquote>
<p>
For a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to two or three qubits, we show that the photon-photon correlations have a wide variety of behavior, with structure that depends sensitively on the frequency and on the qubit-qubit separation $L$. We study the correlations by calculating the second-order correlation function $g_2(t)$ in which the interference among the photons multiply scattered from the qubits causes rich structure. In one case, for example, transmitted and reflected photons are both bunched initially, but then become strongly anti-bunched for a long time interval. We first calculate the correlation function $g_2(t)$ including non-Markovian effects and then show that a much simpler Markovian treatment, which can be solved analytically, is accurate for small qubit separation. As a result, the non-classical properties of microwaves in a 1D waveguide coupled to many superconducting qubits with experimentally accessible separation $L$ could be readily explored with our approach.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many physical systems considered promising qubit candidates are not, in fact, two-level systems. Such systems can leak out of the preferred computational states, leading to errors on any qubits that interact with leaked qubits. Without specific methods of dealing with leakage, long-lived leakage can lead to time-correlated errors. We study the impact of such time-correlated errors on topological quantum error correction codes, which are considered highly practical codes, using the repetition code as a representative case study. We show that, under physically reasonable assumptions, a threshold error rate still exists, however performance is significantly degraded. We then describe simple additional quantum circuitry that, when included in the error detection cycle, restores performance to acceptable levels.

<p>
We dress bare quantum graphs with finite delta function potentials and calculate optical nonlinearities that are found to match the fundamental limits set by potential optimization. We show that structures whose first hyperpolarizability is near the maximum are well described by only three states, the so-called three-level Ansatz, while structures with the largest second hyperpolarizability require four states. We analyze a very large set of configurations for graphs with quasi-quadratic energy spectra and show how they exhibit better response than bare graphs through exquisite optimization of the shape of the eigenfunctions enabled by the existence of the finite potentials. We also discover an exception to the universal scaling properties of the three-level model parameters and trace it to the observation that a greater number of levels are required to satisfy the sum rules even when the three-level Ansatz is satisfied and the first hyperpolarizability is at its maximum value, as specified by potential optimization. This exception in the universal scaling properties of nonlinear optical structures at the limit is traced to the discontinuity in the gradient of the eigenfunctions at the location of the delta potential. This is the first time that dressed quantum graphs have been devised and solved for their nonlinear response, and it is the first analytical model of a confined dynamic system with a simple potential energy that achieves the fundamental limits.

<p>
We present a density matrix approach for computing global solutions of Hartree-Fock theory, based on semidefinite programming (SDP), that gives upper and lower bounds on the Hartree-Fock energy of quantum systems. Equality of the upper- and lower-bound energies guarantees that the computed solution is the globally optimal solution of Hartree-Fock theory. For strongly correlated systems the SDP approach requires us to reassess the accuracy of the Hartree-Fock energies and densities from standard software packages for electronic structure theory. Calculations of the H$<em>{4}$ dimer and N$</em>{2}$ molecule show that the energies from SDP Hartree-Fock are lower than those from standard Hartree-Fock methods by 100-200 kcal/mol in the dissociation region. The present findings have important consequences for the computation and interpretation of electron correlation, which is typically defined relative to the Hartree-Fock energy and density.

We determine the local distribution of fluxes through the observation of cyclotron orbits of the atoms on lattice plaquettes, showing that the system is described by the Hofstadter model. Furthermore, we show that for two atomic spin states with opposite magnetic moments, our system naturally realizes the time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian underlying the quantum spin Hall effect, i.e., two different spin components experience opposite directions of the magnetic field.

<p>
The thermal properties of a system, comprising of a spinless non-interacting charged particle in the presence of a constant external magnetic field and confined in a parabolic quantum well are studied. The focus has been on the effects of a topological defect, of the form of conical disclination, with regard to the thermodynamic properties of the system. We have obtained the modifications to the traditional Landau-Fock-Darwin spectrum in the presence of conical disclination. The effect of the conical kink on the degeneracy structure of the energy levels is investigated. The canonical formalism is used to compute various thermodynamic variables. The study shows an interplay between magnetic field, temperature and the degree of conicity by setting two scales for temperature corresponding to the frequency of the confining potential and the cyclotron frequency of external magnetic field. The kink parameter is found to affect the quantitative behaviour of the thermodynamic quantities. It plays a crucial role in the competition between the external magnetic field and temperature in fixing the values of the thermal response functions. This study provides an important motivation for studying similar systems, however with non trivial interactions in the presence of topological defects.

Optical systems combining balanced loss and gain profiles provide a unique platform to implement classical analogues of quantum systems described by non-Hermitian parity-time- (PT-) symmetric Hamiltonians and to originate new synthetic materials with novel properties. To date, experimental works on PT-symmetric optical systems have been limited to waveguides in which resonances do not play a role. Here we report the first demonstration of PT-symmetry breaking in optical resonator systems by using two directly coupled on-chip optical whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microtoroid silica resonators. Gain in one of the resonators is provided by optically pumping Erbium (Er3+) ions embedded in the silica matrix; the other resonator exhibits passive loss. The coupling strength between the resonators is adjusted by using nanopositioning stages to tune their distance. We have observed reciprocal behavior of the PT-symmetric system in the linear regime, as well as a transition to nonreciprocity in the PT symmetry-breaking phase transition due to the significant enhancement of nonlinearity in the broken-symmetry phase. Our results represent a significant advance towards a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.

<blockquote>
<p>
A hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations approximates the global optimum of polynomial optimization problems of noncommuting variables. Generating the relaxation, however, is a computationally demanding task, and only problems of commuting variables have efficient generators. We develop an implementation for problems of noncommuting problems that creates the relaxation to be solved by SDPA -- a high-performance solver that runs in a distributed environment. We further exploit the inherent sparsity of optimization problems in quantum physics to reduce the complexity of resulting relaxation. Constrained problems with a relaxation of order one may contain up to hundreds of variables. The implementation is available in C++ and Python. The tool helps solve problems such as finding the ground state energy or testing quantum correlations.
