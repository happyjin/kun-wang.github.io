    <p><strong>1.    Generation of polarization entangled photons using type-II doubly periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we address the issue of the generation of non-degenerate cross-polarization-entangled photon pairs using type-II periodically poled lithium niobate. We show that, by an appropriate engineering of the quasi-phase-matching grating, it is possible to simultaneously satisfy the conditions for two spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes, namely ordinary pump photon down-conversion to either extraordinary signal and ordinary idler paired photons, or to ordinary signal and extraordinary idler paired photons. In contrast to single type-II phase-matching, these two processes, when enabled together, can lead to the direct production of cross-polarization-entangled state for non degenerate signal and idler wavelengths. Such a scheme should be of great interest in applications requiring polarization-entangled non degenerate paired photons with, for instance, one of the entangled photons at an appropriate wavelength being used for local operation or for quantum storage in an atomic ensemble, and the other one at the typical wavelength of 1550 nm for propagation through an optical fiber.

<p><strong>2.    Equivalence between discrete quantum walk models in arbitrary topologies</strong><br>

<p>
Coin and scattering are the two major formulations for discrete quantum walks models, each believed to have its own advantages in different applications. Although they are related in some cases, it was an open question their equivalence in arbitrary topologies. Here we present a general construction for the two models for any graph and also for position dependent transition amplitudes. We then prove constructively their unitary equivalence. Defining appropriate projector operators, we moreover show how to obtain the probabilities for one model from the evolution of the other.

<p>
The angular momentum operators for a system of two spin-zero indistinguishable particles are constructed, using Isham&#39;s Canonical Group Quantization method. This mathematically rigorous method provides a hint at the correct definition of (total) angular momentum operators, for arbitrary spin, in a system of indistinguishable particles. The connection with other configuration space approaches to spin-statistics is discussed, as well as the relevance of the obtained results in view of a possible alternative proof of the spin-statistics theorem.

<p><strong>4.    The Need for Structure in Quantum Speedups</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0996">http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0996</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there a general theorem that tells us when we can hope for exponential speedups from quantum algorithms, and when we cannot? In this paper, we make two advances toward such a theorem, in the black-box model where most quantum algorithms operate. First, we show that for any problem that is invariant under permuting inputs and outputs (like the collision or the element distinctness problems), the quantum query complexity is at least the 7th root of the classical randomized query complexity. (An earlier version of this paper gave the 9th root.) This resolves a conjecture of Watrous from 2002. Second, inspired by recent work of O&#39;Donnell et al. (2005) and Dinur et al. (2006), we conjecture that every bounded low-degree polynomial has a &quot;highly influential&quot; variable. Assuming this conjecture, we show that every T-query quantum algorithm can be simulated on most inputs by a poly(T)-query classical algorithm, and that one essentially cannot hope to prove P!=BQP relative to a random oracle.

<blockquote>
<p>
We evaluate the quantum discord dynamics of two qubits in independent and common non-Markovian environments. We compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum discord. For independent reservoirs the quantum discord vanishes only at discrete instants whereas the entanglement can disappear during a finite time interval. For a common reservoir, quantum discord and entanglement can behave very differently with sudden birth of the former but not of the latter. Furthermore, in this case the quantum discord dynamics presents sudden changes in the derivative of its time evolution which is evidenced by the presence of kinks in its behavior at discrete instants of time.

<p><strong>6.    Searching via walking: How to find a marked subgraph of a graph using quantum walks</strong><br>
Mark Hillery, Daniel Reitzner, Vladimir Buzek<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1102">http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1102</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how a quantum walk can be used to find a marked edge or a marked complete subgraph of a complete graph. We employ a version of a quantum walk, the scattering walk, which lends itself to experimental implementation. The edges are marked by adding elements to them that impart a specific phase shift to the particle as it enters or leaves the edge. If the complete graph has N vertices and the subgraph has K vertices, the particle becomes localized on the subgraph in O(N/K) steps. This leads to a quantum search that is quadratically faster than a corresponding classical search. We show how to implement the quantum walk using a quantum circuit and a quantum oracle, which allows us to specify the resource needed for a quantitative comparison of the efficiency of classical and quantum searches -- the number of oracle calls.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report on experimental implementation of the optimal universal asymmetric 1-&gt;2 quantum cloning machine for qubits encoded into polarization states of single photons. Our linear optical machine performs asymmetric cloning by partially symmetrizing the input polarization state of signal photon and a blank copy idler photon prepared in a maximally mixed state. We show that the employed method of measurement of mean clone fidelities exhibits strong resilience to imperfect calibration of the relative efficiencies of single-photon detectors used in the experiment. Reliable characterization of the quantum cloner is thus possible even when precise detector calibration is difficult to achieve.

<p>
On-chip integrated photonic circuits are crucial to further progress towards quantum technologies and in the science of quantum optics. Here we report precise control of single photon states and multi-photon entanglement directly on-chip. We manipulate the state of path-encoded qubits using integrated optical phase control based on resistive elements, observing an interference contrast of 98.2+/-0.3%. We demonstrate integrated quantum metrology by observing interference fringes with 2- and 4-photon entangled states generated in a waveguide circuit, with respective interference contrasts of 97.2+/-0.4% and 92+/-4%, sufficient to beat the standard quantum limit. Finally, we demonstrate a reconfigurable circuit that continuously and accurately tunes the degree of quantum interference, yielding a maximum visibility of 98.2+/- 0.9%. These results open up adaptive and fully reconfigurable photonic quantum circuits not just for single photons, but for all quantum states of light.

<p><strong>12.    A Quantum Lovasz Local Lemma</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, Or Sattath<br>
Journal of the ACM, Volume 59 Issue 5, October 2012, Article No. 24<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1696">http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1696</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) is a powerful tool in probability theory to show the existence of combinatorial objects meeting a prescribed collection of &quot;weakly dependent&quot; criteria. We show that the LLL extends to a much more general geometric setting, where events are replaced with subspaces and probability is replaced with relative dimension, which allows to lower bound the dimension of the intersection of vector spaces under certain independence conditions. Our result immediately applies to the k-QSAT problem: For instance we show that any collection of rank 1 projectors with the property that each qubit appears in at most $2^k/(e \cdot k)$ of them, has a joint satisfiable state. We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-QSAT. Recent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of 1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits. Using a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend the known satisfiable region for random k-QSAT to a density of $\Omega(2^k/k^2)$. Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint satisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate into regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled, avoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to product states.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-Markovian effect on the dynamics of the quantum discord by exactly solving a model consisting of two independent qubits subject to two zero-temperature non-Markovian reservoirs, respectively. Considering the two qubits initially prepared in Bell-like or extended Werner-like states, we show that there is no occurrence of the sudden death, but only instantaneous disappearance of the quantum discord at some time points, in comparison to the entanglement sudden death in the same range of the parameters of interest. It implies that the quantum discord is more useful than the entanglement to describe quantum correlation involved in quantum systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate a quantum walk on a line in phase space using one and two trapped ion. A walk with up to 23 steps is realized by subjecting an ion to state-dependent displacement operations interleaved with quantum coin tossing operations. To analyze the ion&#39;s motional state after each step we apply a technique that directly maps the probability density distribution onto the ion&#39;s internal state. The measured probability distributions and the position&#39;s second moment clearly show the non-classical character of the quantum walk. To further highlight the difference between the classical (random) and the quantum walk, we demonstrate the reversibility of the latter. Finally, we extend the quantum walk by using two ions, giving the walker the additional possibility to stay instead of taking a step.

<p><strong>15.    Theory of Quantum Pulse Position Modulation and Related Numerical Problems</strong><br>
G. Cariolaro, G. Pierobon<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2633">http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2633</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The paper deals with quantum pulse position modulation (PPM), both in the absence (pure states) and in the presence (mixed states) of thermal noise, using the Glauber representation of coherent laser radiation. The objective is to find optimal (or suboptimal) measurement operators and to evaluate the corresponding error probability. For PPM, the correct formulation of quantum states is given by the tensorial product of m identical Hilbert spaces, where m is the PPM order. The presence of mixed states, due to thermal noise, generates an optimization problem involving matrices of huge dimensions, which already for 4-PPM, are of the order of ten thousand. To overcome this computational complexity, the currently available methods of quantum detection, which are based on explicit results, convex linear programming and square root measurement, are compared to find the computationally less expensive one. In this paper a fundamental role is played by the geometrically uniform symmetry of the quantum PPM format. The evaluation of error probability confirms the vast superiority of the quantum detection over its classical counterpart.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to protect quantum information from the effect of noise is one of the major goals of quantum information processing. In this article, we study limitations on the asymptotic stability of quantum information stored in passive N-qubit systems. We consider the effect of small imperfections in the implementation of the protecting Hamiltonian in the form of perturbations or weak coupling to a ground state environment. We prove that, regardless of the protecting Hamiltonian, there exists a perturbed evolution that necessitates a final error correcting step when the state of the memory is read. Such an error correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof being exemplified by the 3D compass model. We go on to present explicit weak Hamiltonian perturbations which destroy the logical information stored in the 2D toric code in a time O(log(N)).

We address the problem of quantifying the non-Markovian character of quantum time-evolutions of general systems in contact with an environment. We introduce two different measures of non-Markovianity that exploit the specific traits of quantum correlations and are suitable for opposite experimental contexts. When complete tomographic knowledge about the evolution is available, our measure provides a necessary and sufficient condition to quantify strictly the non-Markovianity. In the opposite case, when no information whatsoever is available, we propose a sufficient condition for non-Markovianity. Remarkably, no optimization procedure underlies our derivation, which greatly enhances the practical relevance of the proposed criteria.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a theoretical technique for solving the quantum transport problem of a few photons through a one-dimensional, strongly nonlinear waveguide. We specifically consider the situation where the evolution of the optical field is governed by the quantum nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equation (NLSE). Although this kind of nonlinearity is quite general, we focus on a realistic implementation involving cold atoms loaded in a hollow-core optical fiber, where the atomic system provides a tunable nonlinearity that can be large even at a single-photon level. In particular, we show that when the interaction between photons is effectively repulsive, the transmission of multi-photon components of the field is suppressed. This leads to anti-bunching of the transmitted light and indicates that the system acts as a single-photon switch. On the other hand, in the case of attractive interaction, the system can exhibit either anti-bunching or bunching, which is in stark contrast to semiclassical calculations. We show that the bunching behavior is related to the resonant excitation of bound states of photons inside the system.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we study decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on one-dimension regular networks. For this purpose, we assume that every node is represented by a quantum dot continuously monitored by an individual point contact(Gurvitz&#39;s model). This measuring process induces decoherence. We focus on small rates of decoherence and then obtain the mixing time bound of the CTQWs on one-dimension regular network which its distance parameter is $l\geq 2$. Our results show that the mixing time is inversely proportional to rate of decoherence which is in agreement with the mentioned results for cycles in \cite{FST,VKR}. Also, the same result is provided in \cite{SSRR} for long-range interacting cycles. Moreover, we find that this quantity is independent of distance parameter $l(l\geq 2)$ and that the small values of decoherence make short the mixing time on these networks.

We also measured an optical coherence time of 1.6 $\mu$s for the $^3$H$_6\leftrightarrow{}^3$H$_4$, 795 nm wavelength transition, and investigated the limitation of spectral diffusion to spectral hole burning. Upon application of magnetic fields of a few hundred Gauss, we observed persistent spectral holes with lifetimes up to seconds. Furthermore, we measured a linear Stark shift of 25 kHz$\cdot$cm/V. Our results are promising for integrated, electro-optical, waveguide quantum memory for photons.

<blockquote>
<p>
While not yet in commercial existence, quantum computers have the ability to solve certain classes of problems that are not efficiently solvable on existing Turing Machine based (classical) computers. For quantum computers to be of use, methods of programming them must exist. Proposals exist for programming quantum computers, but all of the existing ones suffer from flaws that make them impractical in commercial software development environments. Cove is a framework for programming quantum computers that extends existing classical languages to allow for quantum computation, thus providing a quantum computing toolkit for commercial software developers. Since the target users of Cove are commercial developers, it is an object oriented framework that can be used by multiple languages and also places emphasis on complete documentation. The focus of Cove is not so much on the software product, but on the fundamental concepts that make quantum computing practical for common developers.
