<p><strong>2.    An integrated processor for photonic quantum states using a broadband light-matter interface</strong><br>

<p>
Faithful storage and coherent manipulation of quantum optical pulses are key for long distance quantum communications and quantum computing. Combining these functions in a light-matter interface that can be integrated on-chip with other photonic quantum technologies, e.g. sources of entangled photons, is an important step towards these applications. To date there have only been a few demonstrations of coherent pulse manipulation utilizing optical storage devices compatible with quantum states, and that only in atomic gas media (making integration difficult) and with limited capabilities. Here we describe how a broadband waveguide quantum memory based on the Atomic Frequency Comb (AFC) protocol can be used as a programmable processor for essentially arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum optical pulses. Using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon level, we experimentally demonstrate sequencing, time-to-frequency multiplexing and demultiplexing, splitting, interfering, temporal and spectral filtering, compressing and stretching as well as selective delaying. Our integrated light-matter interface offers high-rate, robust and easily configurable manipulation of quantum optical pulses and brings fully practical optical quantum devices one step closer to reality. Furthermore, as the AFC protocol is suitable for storage of intense light pulses, our processor may also find applications in classical communications.

<p><strong>3.    Boson sampling with displaced single-photon Fock states versus single-photon-added coherent states---The quantum-classical divide and computational-complexity transitions in linear optics</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Boson sampling is a specific quantum computation, which is likely hard to implement efficiently on a classical computer. The task is to sample the output photon number distribution of a linear optical interferometric network, which is fed with single-photon Fock state inputs. A question that has been asked is if the sampling problems associated with any other input quantum states of light (other than the Fock states) to a linear optical network and suitable output detection strategies are also of similar computational complexity as boson sampling. We consider the states that differ from the Fock states by a displacement operation, namely the displaced Fock states and the photon-added coherent states. It is easy to show that the sampling problem associated with displaced single-photon Fock states and a displaced photon number detection scheme is in the same complexity class as boson sampling for all values of displacement. On the other hand, we show that the sampling problem associated with single-photon-added coherent states and the same displaced photon number detection scheme demonstrates a computational complexity transition. It transitions from being just as hard as boson sampling when the input coherent amplitudes are sufficiently small, to a classically simulatable problem in the limit of large coherent amplitudes.

<p><strong>4.    Noise resistance of violation of local causality for pure three-qutrit entangled states</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0738">http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0738</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bell&#39;s Theorem started with two qubits, spins $1/2$. It is a no-go statement on classical (local causal) models of quantum correlations. Only after 25 years, it turned out that for three qubits the situation is even more mind boggling. General statements concerning higher dimensional systems, qutrits etc., started to appear even later, once the spin (higher than $1/2$) picture was replaced by a more broad one, allowing all possible observables. This work is continuation of the Gdansk effort to take advantage of the fact that Bell Theorem can be put in form of a linear programming problem, which in turn can be translated into a computer code. Our results are numerical and classify the strength of non-classicality of various families of three-qutrit states, as measured by resistance to noise. This is a previously uncharted territory. The results may be helpful in suggesting which three-qutrit states are handy for applications in quantum information protocols. One of the surprises is that the W state turns out to have a stronger non-classicality than the GHZ state.

We report direct evidence of the bosonic nature of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a scattering-based beamsplitter. A parametric down-conversion source is used to produce two indistinguishable photons, each of which is converted into a SPP on a metal-stripe waveguide and then made to interact through a semi-transparent Bragg mirror. In this plasmonic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, we measure a coincidence dip with a visibility of 72%, a key signature that SPPs are bosons and that quantum interference is clearly involved.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) based on dielectric waveguides have been widely used in linear optical quantum computation. Recently, surface plasmons have been introduced to this application because they can confine and manipulate light beyond the diffraction limit. In this study, the on-chip quantum interference of two single surface plasmons was achieved using dielectric-loaded surface-plasmon-polariton waveguides. The high visibility (greater than 90%) proves the bosonic nature of single plasmons and emphasizes the feasibility of achieving basic quantum logic gates for linear optical quantum computation. The effect of intrinsic losses in plasmonic waveguides with regard to quantum information processing is also discussed. Although the influence of this effect was negligible in the current experiment, our studies reveal that such losses can dramatically reduce quantum interference visibility in certain cases; thus, quantum coherence must be carefully considered when designing QPIC devices.

<p><strong>7.    Efficient method for localized functions using domain transformation and Fourier sine series</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
An efficient approach to handle localized states by using spectral methods (SM) in one and three dimensions is presented. The method consists of transformation of the infinite domain to the bounded domain in $(0, \pi)$ and using the Fourier sine series as a set of basis functions for the SM. It is shown that with an appropriate choice of transformation functions, this method manages to preserve the good properties of original SMs; more precisely, superb computational efficiency when high level of accuracy is necessary. This is made possible by analytically exploiting the properties of the transformation function and the Fourier sine series. An especially important property of this approach is the possibility of calculating the Hartree energy very efficiently. This is done by exploiting the positive properties of the sine series as a basis set and conducting an extinctive part of the calculations analytically. We illustrate the efficiency of this method and implement it to solve the Poisson&#39;s and Helmholtz equations in both one and three dimensions. The efficiency of the method is verified through a comparison to recently published results for both one and three dimensional problems.

<blockquote>
<p>
A connection between the asymptotic behavior of the open quantum walk and the spectrum of a generalized quantum coins is studied. For the case of simultaneously diagonalizable transition operators an exact expression for probability distribution of the position of the walker for arbitrary number of steps is found. For a large number of steps the probability distribution consist of maximally two &quot;soliton&quot;-like solution and a certain number of Gaussian distributions. The number of different contributions to the final probability distribution is equal to the number of distinct absolute values in the spectrum of the transition operators. The presence of the zeros in spectrum is an indicator of the &quot;soliton&quot;-like solutions in the probability distribution.

<p><strong>9.    Path integral Monte Carlo on a lattice: extended states</strong><br>
Mark O&#39;Callaghan, Bruce N. Miller<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The equilibrium properties of a single quantum particle (qp) interacting with a classical gas for a wide range of temperatures that explore the system&#39;s behavior in the classical as well as in the quantum regime is investigated. Both the quantum particle and atoms are restricted to the sites of a one-dimensional lattice. A path-integral formalism is developed within the context of the canonical ensemble in which the quantum particle is represented by a closed, variable-step random walk on the lattice. Monte Carlo methods are employed to determine the system&#39;s properties. For the case of a free particle, analytical expressions for the energy, its fluctuations, and the qp-qp correlation function are derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulations. To test the usefulness of the path integral formalism, the Metropolis algorithm is employed to determine the equilibrium properties of the qp for a periodic interaction potential, forcing the qp to occupy extended states. We consider a striped potential in one dimension, where every other lattice site is occupied by an atom with potential $\epsilon$, and every other lattice site is empty. This potential serves as a stress test for the path integral formalism because of its rapid site-to-site variation. An analytical solution was determined in this case by utilizing Bloch&#39;s theorem due to the periodicity of the potential. Comparisons of the potential energy, the total energy, the energy fluctuations and the correlation function are made between the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and the analytical calculations.

<p>
It is known that entanglement dynamics of two noninteracting qubits, locally subjected to classical environments, may exhibit revivals. A simple explanation of this phenomenon may be provided by using the concept of hidden entanglement, which signals the presence of entanglement that may be recovered without the help of nonlocal operations. Here we discuss the link between hidden entanglement and the (non-Markovian) flow of classical information between the system and the environment.

<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum emitter efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide constitutes a promising system for the realization of single-photon transistors, quantum-logic gates based on giant single-photon nonlinearities, and high bit-rate deterministic single-photon sources. The key figure of merit for such devices is the $\beta$-factor, which is the probability for an emitted single photon to be channeled into a desired waveguide mode. We report on the experimental achievement of $\beta = 98.43 \pm 0.04\%$ for a quantum dot coupled to a photonic-crystal waveguide, corresponding to a single-emitter cooperativity of $\eta = 62.7 \pm 1.5$. This constitutes a nearly ideal photon-matter interface where the quantum dot acts effectively as a 1D &quot;artificial&quot; atom, since it interacts almost exclusively with just a single propagating optical mode. The $\beta$-factor is found to be remarkably robust to variations in position and emission wavelength of the quantum dots. Our work demonstrates the extraordinary potential of photonic-crystal waveguides for highly efficient single-photon generation and on-chip photon-photon interaction.

<p>
In systems with ``balanced loss and gain&#39;&#39;, the PT-symmetry is broken by increasing the non-hermiticity or the loss-gain strength. We show that finite lattices with oscillatory, PT-symmetric potentials exhibit a new class of PT-symmetry breaking and restoration. We obtain the PT phase diagram as a function of potential periodicity, which also controls the location complex eigenvalues in the lattice spectrum. We show that the sum of PT-potentials with nearby periodicities leads to PT-symmetry restoration, where the system goes from a PT-broken state to a PT-symmetric state as the average loss-gain strength is increased. We discuss the implications of this novel transition for the propagation of a light in an array of coupled waveguides.

<blockquote>
<p>
Taking the non-Markovian effect into account, we study how to store a single photon of arbitrary temporal shape in a single atom coupled to an optical cavity. Our model applies to Raman transitions in three-level atoms with one branch of the transition controlled by a driving pulse, and the other coupled to the cavity. For any couplings of input field to the optical cavity and detunings of the atom from the driving pulse and cavity, we extend the input-output relation from Markovian dynamics to non-Markovian one. For most possible photon shapes, we derive an analytic expression for the driving pulse in order to completely map the input photon into the atom. We find that, the amplitude of the driving pulse depends only on the detuning of the atom from the frequency of the cavity, i.e., the detuning of the atom to the driving pulse has no effect on the strength of the driving pulse.

In the current work we present the complete results for the measurement of normal Casimir force between shallow and smooth sinusoidally corrugated gold coated sphere and a plate at various angles between the corrugations using an atomic force microscope. All measured data were compared with the theoretical approach using the proximity force approximation and theory based on derivative expansion. In both cases real material properties of the surfaces and non-zero temperature were taken into account. Special attention is paid to the description of electrostatic interactions between corrugated surfaces at different angels between corrugations and samples reparation and characterization. The measured forces are found to be in good agreement with the theory including correlation effects of geometry and material properties and deviate significantly from the predictions of the proximity force approximation approach. This provides the quantitative confirmation for the observation of diffraction-type effects that are disregarded within the PFA approach. The obtained results open new opportunities for control of the Casimir effect in micromechanical systems.

The ability to coherently convert the frequency and temporal waveform of single and entangled photons will be crucial to interconnect the various elements of future quantum information networks. Of particular importance in this context is the quantum frequency conversion of photons emitted by material systems able to store quantum information, so called quantum memories. There have been significant efforts to implement quantum frequency conversion using non linear crystals, with non classical light from broadband photon pair sources and solid state emitters. However, so far, solid state quantum frequency conversion has not been achieved with long lived optical quantum memories. Here, we demonstrate an ultra low noise solid state photonic quantum interface suitable for connecting quantum memories based on atomic ensembles to the telecommunication fiber network. The interface is based on an integrated waveguide non linear device. As a proof of principle, we convert heralded single photons at 780nm emitted by a rubidium based quantum memory to the telecommunication wavelength of 1552nm. We demonstrate a significant amount of non classical correlations between the converted photon and the heralding signal.

By using the experimental values related to the intrinsic property of the converter, and using the intensity correlation and the average photon number of a 637-nm input light pulse, we derive the intensity correlation of a converted telecom light pulse. Then we discuss feasibility of a single-photon frequency conversion to the telecommunication band for a long-distance quantum communication based on NV centers in diamond.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a surface code suffering decoherence due to coupling to a bath of bosonic modes at finite temperature and study the time available before the unavoidable breakdown of error correction occurs as a function of coupling and bath parameters. We derive an exact expression for the error rate on each individual qubit of the code, taking spatial and temporal correlations between the errors into account. We investigate numerically how different kinds of spatial correlations between errors in the surface code affect its threshold error rate. This allows us to derive the maximal duration of each quantum error correction period by studying when the single-qubit error rate reaches the corresponding threshold. At the time when error correction breaks down, the error rate in the code can be dominated by the direct coupling of each qubit to the bath, by mediated subluminal interactions, or by mediated superluminal interactions. For a 2D Ohmic bath, the time available per quantum error correction period vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of a large code size $L$ due to induced superluminal interactions, though it does so only like $1/\sqrt{\log L}$. For all other bath types considered, this time remains finite as $L\rightarrow\infty$.

A new model of quantum random walks is introduced, on lattices as well as on finite graphs. These quantum random walks take into account the behavior of open quantum systems. They are the exact quantum analogues of classical Markov chains. We explore the &quot;quantum trajectory&quot; point of view on these quantum random walks, that is, we show that measuring the position of the particle after each time- step gives rise to a classical Markov chain, on the lattice times the state space of the particle. This quantum trajectory is a simulation of the master equation of the quantum random walk. The physical pertinence of such quantum random walks and the way they can be concretely realized is discussed. Differences and connections with the already well-known quantum random walks, such as the Hadamard random walk, are established.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable particles (bosons, fermions or hard-core bosons) in one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbour interactions. The two interacting particles can undergo independent- and/or co-walking dependent on both quantum statistics and interaction strength. We find that two strongly interacting particles may form a bound state and then co-walk like a single composite particle with statistics-dependent propagation speed. Such an effective single-particle picture of co-walking is analytically derived in the context of degenerate perturbation and the analytical results are well consistent with direct numerical simulation. In addition to implementing universal quantum computation and observing bound states, two-particle quantum walks offer a novel route to detecting quantum statistics. Our theoretical results can be examined in experiments of light propagations in two-dimensional waveguide arrays or spin-impurity dynamics of ultracold atoms in one-dimensional optical lattices.

<p>
We propose a single-photon frequency converter via a one-dimensional waveguide coupled to a $V$-type atom. The on-demand classical field allows the atom to absorb a photon with a given frequency, then emit a photon with a carried frequency different from the absorbed one. The absorption and re-emission process is formulated as a two-channel scattering process. We study the single-photon frequency conversion mechanism in two kinds of realistic physical system: coupled resonator waveguide with cosine dispersion relation and an optical waveguide with linear dispersion relation respectively. We find that the driving field prefers weak in coupled resonator waveguide but arbitrarily strong in optical waveguide to achieve an optical transfer efficiency.

<p>
We consider the problems of identifying and estimating dynamical parameters of an ergodic quantum Markov chain, when only the stationary output is accessible for measurements. On the identifiability question, we show that the knowledge of the output state completely fixes the dynamics up to a <code>coordinate transformation&#39; consisting of a multiplication by a phase and a unitary conjugation of the Kraus operators. When the dynamics depends on an unknown parameter, we show that the latter can be estimated at the</code>standard&#39; rate $n^{-1/2}$, and give an explicit expression of the (asymptotic) quantum Fisher information of the output, which is proportional to the Markov variance of a certain <code>generator&#39;. More generally, we show that the output is locally asymptotically normal, i.e. it can be approximated by a simple quantum Gaussian model consisting of a coherent state whose mean is related to the unknown parameter. As a consistency check we prove that a parameter related to the</code>coordinate transformation&#39; unitaries, has zero quantum Fisher information.

<blockquote>
<p>
Bound states in the continuum (BIC), i.e. normalizable modes with an energy embedded in the continuous spectrum of scattered states, are shown to exist in certain optical waveguide lattices with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defects. Two distinct types of BIC modes are found: BIC states that exist in the broken $\mathcal{PT}$ phase, corresponding to exponentially-localized modes with either exponentially damped or amplified optical power; and BIC modes with sub-exponential spatial localization that can exist in the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ phase as well. The two types of BIC modes at the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking point behave rather differently: while in the former case spatial localization is lost and the defect coherently radiates outgoing waves with an optical power that linearly increases with the propagation distance, in the latter case localization is maintained and the optical power increase is quadratic.

<blockquote>
<p>
The spectral, dynamical and topological properties of physical systems described by non-Hermitian (including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonians are deeply modified by the appearance of exceptional points and spectral singularities. Here we show that exceptional points in the continuum can arise in non-Hermitian (yet admitting and entirely real-valued energy spectrum) optical lattices with engineered defects. At an exceptional point, the lattice sustains a bound state with an energy embedded in the spectrum of scattered states, similar to the von-Neumann Wigner bound states in the continuum of Hermitian lattices. However, the dynamical and scattering properties of the bound state at an exceptional point are deeply different from those of ordinary von-Neumann Wigner bound states in an Hermitian system. In particular, the bound state in the continuum at an exceptional point is an unstable state that can secularly grow by an infinitesimal perturbation. Such properties are discussed in details for transport of discretized light in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric array of coupled optical waveguides, which could provide an experimentally accessible system to observe exceptional points in the continuum.

<blockquote>
<p>
Effective descriptions accounting for the evolution of quantum systems that are acted on by a bath are desirable. As the number of bath degrees of freedom increases and full quantum simulations turn out computationally prohibitive, simpler models become essential to understand and gain an insight into the main physical mechanisms involved in the system dynamics. In this regard, vibrational decoherence of an I$_2$ diatomics is tackled here within the framework of Markovian quantum state diffusion. The I$_2$ dynamics are analyzed in terms of an effective decoherence rate, $\Lambda$, and the specific choice of the initial state, in particular, Gaussian wave packets and two-state superpositions. It is found that, for Markovian baths, the relevant quantity regarding decoherence is the product of friction ($\eta$) and temperature ($T$); there is no distinction between varying one or the other. It is also observed that decoherence becomes faster as the energy levels involved in the system state correspond to higher eigenvalues. This effect is due to a population redistribution during the dynamical process and an eventual irreversible loss of the initial coherence. These results have been compared with those available in the literature from more detailed semiclassical IVR simulations, finding a good agreement.

The degree of non-Markovianity, quantified using a measure based on the trace distance, is found to be much greater for all coupling strengths, when system-environment correlations are maintained.

<p>
A quantum computer can solve hard problems - such as prime factoring, database searching, and quantum simulation - at the cost of needing to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction provides this protection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows for constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural choice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99%. Here, we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92% and a two-qubit gate fidelity up to 99.4%. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits.

The bottom-up approach that we pursue is aimed at identifying similarities and differences in the behavior of non-Markovianity indicators in several paradigmatic open system models. This in turn allows us to infer the leading traits of the variegated phenomenon known as non-Markovian dynamics and, possibly, to grasp its physical essence.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate how the introduction of different types of disorder affects the generation of entanglement between the internal (spin) and external (position) degrees of freedom in one-dimensional quantum random walks (QRW). Disorder is modeled by adding another random feature to QRW, i.e., the quantum coin that drives the system&#39;s evolution is randomly chosen at each position and/or at each time step, giving rise to either dynamic, fluctuating, or static disorder. The first one is position-independent, with every lattice site having the same coin at a given time, the second has time and position dependent randomness, while the third one is time-independent. We show for several levels of disorder that dynamic disorder is the most powerful entanglement generator, followed closely by fluctuating disorder. Static disorder is the less efficient entangler, being almost always less efficient than the ordered case. Also, dynamic and fluctuating disorder lead to maximally entangled states asymptotically in time for any initial condition while static disorder has no asymptotic limit and, similarly to the ordered case, has a long time behavior highly sensitive to the initial conditions.

<p>
The degree of non-Markovianity of quantum processes has been characterized in several different ways in the recent literature. However, the relationship between the non-Markovian behavior and the flow of information between the system and the environment through an entropic measure has not been yet established. We propose an entanglement-based measure of non-Markovianity by employing the concept of assisted knowledge, where the environment E, acquires information about a system S, by means of its measurement apparatus A. The assisted knowledge, based on the accessible information in terms of von-Neumann entropy, monotonically increases in time for all Markovian quantum processes. We demonstrate that the signatures of non-Markovianity can be captured by the nonmonotonic behaviour of the assisted knowledge. We explore this scenario for a two-level system undergoing a relaxation process, through an experimental implementation using an optical approach that allows full access to the state of the environment.

<p>
A semiclassical simulation approach is presented for studying quantum noise in large-scale photonic circuits incorporating an ideal Kerr nonlinearity. A circuit solver is used to generate matrices defining a set of stochastic differential equations, in which the resonator field variables represent random samplings of the Wigner quasi-probability distributions. Although the semiclassical approach involves making a large-photon-number approximation, tests on one- and two-resonator circuits indicate satisfactory agreement between the semiclassical and full-quantum simulation results in the parameter regime of interest. The semiclassical model is used to simulate random errors in a large-scale circuit that contains 88 resonators and hundreds of components in total, and functions as a 4-bit ripple counter. The error rate as a function of on-state photon number is examined, and it is observed that the quantum fluctuation amplitudes do not increase as signals propagate through the circuit, an important property for scalability.

<p>
This article addresses a number of issues associated with the problem of calculating contributions from the electromagnetic quantum induced energy and stress in a stationary material with an inhomogeneous polarizability. After briefly reviewing the conventional approaches developed by Lifshitz el al and more recent attempts by others, we emphasize the need to accommodate the effects due to the classical constitutive properties of the material in any experimental attempt to detect such contributions. Attention is then concentrated on a particular system composed of an ENZ-type (epsilon-near-zero) meta-material, chosen to have an anisotropic and inhomogeneous permittivity confined in an infinitely long perfectly conducting open waveguide. This permits us to deduce from the source-free Maxwell&#39;s equations a complete set of harmonic electromagnetic evanescent eigen-modes and eigen-frequencies. Since these solutions prohibit the existence of asymptotic scattering states in the guide an alternative regularization scheme, based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula, enables us to prescribe precise criteria for the extraction of finite quantum expectation values from regularized mode sums together with error bounds on these values. This scheme is used to derive analytic results for regularized energy densities in the guide. The criteria are exploited to construct a numerical scheme that is bench-marked by comparing its output with the analytic results derived from the special properties of the inhomogeneous ENZ medium.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear optical cavities are crucial both in classical and quantum optics; in particular, nowadays optical parametric oscillators are one of the most versatile and tunable sources of coherent light, as well as the sources of the highest quality quantum-correlated light in the continuous variable regime. Being nonlinear systems, they can be driven through critical points in which a solution ceases to exist in favour of a new one, and it is close to these points where quantum correlations are the strongest. The simplest description of such systems consists in writing the quantum fields as the classical part plus some quantum fluctuations, linearizing then the dynamical equations with respect to the latter; however, such an approach breaks down close to critical points, where it provides unphysical predictions such as infinite photon numbers. On the other hand, techniques going beyond the simple linear description become too complicated especially regarding the evaluation of two-time correlators, which are of major importance to compute observables outside the cavity. In this article we provide a regularized linear description of nonlinear cavities, that is, a linearization procedure yielding physical results, taking the degenerate optical parametric oscillator as the guiding example. The method, which we call self-consistent linearization, is shown to be equivalent to a general Gaussian ansatz for the state of the system, and we compare its predictions with those obtained with available exact (or quasi-exact) methods.

<p>
We study general quantum waveguides and establish explicit effective Hamiltonians for the Laplacian on these spaces. A conventional quantum waveguide is an $\varepsilon$-tubular neighbourhood of a curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the object of interest is the Dirichlet Laplacian on this tube in the asymptotic limit $\varepsilon\to0$. We generalise this by considering fibre bundles $M$ over a $d$-dimensional submanifold $B\subset\mathbb{R}^{d+k}$ with fibres diffeomorphic to $F\subset\mathbb{R}^k$, whose total space is embedded into an $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $B$. From this point of view $B$ takes the role of the curve and $F$ that of the disc-shaped cross-section of a conventional quantum waveguide. Our approach allows, among other things, for waveguides whose cross-sections $F$ are deformed along $B$ and also the study of the Laplacian on the boundaries of such waveguides. By applying recent results on the adiabatic limit of Schr\&quot;odinger operators on fibre bundles we show, in particular, that for small energies the dynamics and the spectrum of the Laplacian on $M$ are reflected by the adiabatic approximation associated to the ground state band of the normal Laplacian. We give explicit formulas for the according effective operator on $L^2(B)$ in various scenarios, thereby improving and extending many of the known results on quantum waveguides and quantum layers in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Recent exciting progress in the preparation and manipulation of the motional quantum states of a single trapped proton enabled the first direct detection of the particle&#39;s spin state. Based on this success the proton magnetic moment $\mu_p$ was measured with ppm precision in a Penning trap with a superimposed magnetic field inhomogeneity. An improvement by an additional factor of 1000 in precision is possible by application of the so-called double Penning trap technique. In a recent paper we reported the first demonstration of this method with a single trapped proton, which is a major step towards the first direct high-precision measurement of $\mu_p$. The techniques required for the proton can be directly applied to measure the antiproton magnetic moment $\mu_{\bar{p}}$. An improvement in precision of $\mu_{\bar{p}}$ by more than three orders of magnitude becomes possible, which will provide one of the most sensitive tests of CPT invariance. To achieve this research goal we are currently setting up the Baryon Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment (BASE) at the antiproton decelerator (AD) of CERN.

<p><strong>49.    Back-Scattering Properties of a Waveguide-Coupled Array of Atoms in the Strongly Non-Paraxial Regime</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate the back-scattering properties of an array of atoms that is evanescently coupled to an optical nanofiber in the strongly non-paraxial regime. We observe that the power and the polarization of the back-scattered light depend on the nanofiber-guided excitation field in a way that significantly deviates from the predictions of a simple model based on two-level atoms and a scalar waveguide. Even though it has been widely used in previous experimental and theoretical studies of waveguide-coupled quantum emitters, this simple model is thus in general not adequate even for a qualitative description of such systems. We develop an ab initio model which includes the multi-level structure of the atoms and the full vectorial properties of the guided field and find very good agreement with our data.

<p><strong>50.    Semi-analytical model for nonlinear light propagation in strongly interacting Rydberg gases</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Rate equation models are extensively used to describe the many-body states of laser driven atomic gases. We show that the properties of the rate equation model used to describe nonlinear optical effects arising in interacting Rydberg gases can be understood by considering the excitation of individual super-atoms. From this we deduce a simple semi-analytic model that accurately describes the Rydberg density and optical susceptibility for different dimensionalities. We identify the previously reported universal dependence of the susceptibility on the Rydberg excited fraction as an intrinsic property of the rate equation model that is rooted in one-body properties. Benchmarking against exact master equation calculations, we identify regimes in which the semi-analytic model is particularly reliable. The performance of the model improves in the presence of dephasing which destroys higher order atomic coherences.

<p><strong>51.    Alternation in Quantum Programming: From Superposition of Data to Superposition of Programs</strong><br>
Mingsheng Ying, Nengkun Yu, Yuan Feng<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5172">http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5172</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We extract a novel quantum programming paradigm - superposition of programs - from the design idea of a popular class of quantum algorithms, namely quantum walk-based algorithms. The generality of this paradigm is guaranteed by the universality of quantum walks as a computational model. A new quantum programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of superposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of Dijkstra&#39;s GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation (of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs. The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new mathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions. Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived. Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and generalizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum alternation and quantum choice. We believe that quantum programming with quantum alternation and choice will play an important role in further exploiting the power of quantum computing.
