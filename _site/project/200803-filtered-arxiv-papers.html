    <p><strong>1.    High threshold universal quantum computation on the surface code</strong><br>
Austin G. Fowler, Ashley M. Stephens, Peter Groszkowski<br>
Phys. Rev. A 80, 052312 (2009)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a comprehensive and self-contained simplified review of the quantum computing scheme of Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 190504 (2007), which features a 2-D nearest neighbor coupled lattice of qubits, a threshold error rate approaching 1%, natural asymmetric and adjustable strength error correction and low overhead arbitrarily long-range logical gates. These features make it by far the best and most practical quantum computing scheme devised to date. We restrict the discussion to direct manipulation of the surface code using the stabilizer formalism, both of which we also briefly review, to make the scheme accessible to a broad audience.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum error correction may delay, but also cause, entanglement sudden death</strong><br>
Isabel Sainz, Gunnar Bjork<br>
Phys. Rev. A 77, 052307 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0406">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0406</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dissipation may cause two initially entangled qubits to evolve into a separable state in a finite time. This behavior is called entanglement sudden death (ESD). We study to what extent quantum error correction can combat ESD. We find that in some cases quantum error correction can delay entanglement sudden death but in other cases quantum error correction may cause ESD for states that otherwise do not suffer from it. Our analysis also shows that fidelity may not be the best measure to compare the efficiency of different error correction codes since the fidelity is not directly coupled to a state&#39;s remaining entanglement.

<p><strong>3.    A spatial envelope soliton model of the electron - propagating within a fictitious waveguide</strong><br>
Roald Ekholdt<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0467">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0467</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron. The soliton propagates within a waveguide which size varies with the potential. The soliton is the solution of the Schroedinger equation with the addition of a nonlinear term that is the negative of Bohm&#39;s Quantum potential. This potential is interpreted as representing the dispersion of the linear equation. The model is based on de Broglie&#39;s original wave-particle concept, which is based on the Special theory of relativity. The model thus illustrates that theory.

<p><strong>4.    Non-Markovian Open Quantum Systems</strong><br>
Cesar A. Rodriguez-Rosario, E.C.G. Sudarshan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1183">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1183</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a non-Markovian canonical dynamical map that accounts for systems correlated with the environment. The physical meaning of not completely positive maps is studied to obtain a theory of non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The relationship between inverse maps and correlations with the environment is established. A generalized non-Markovian master equation is derived from the canonical dynamical map that goes beyond the Kossakowski-Lindblad Markovian master equation. Non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics can be be studied within this theory.

<p><strong>5.    Linear optical scheme to demonstrate genuine multipartite entanglement for single-particle W states</strong><br>
Hyunchul Nha<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1232">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1232</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the method of entanglement witness operator to verify genuine multipartite entanglement for single-particle W states involving N parties. In particular, linear optical schemes using photo detectors and beam splitters are proposed to implement two different types of witness operator in experiment. The first scheme that requires only a single measurement setting is shown to detect genuine multipartite entanglement for the overall efficiency beyond 1-1/N. On the other hand, the second scheme with N+1 measurement settings achieves success at a significantly lowered efficiency than 1-1/N.

B. Kraus, H. P. Büchler, S. Diehl, A. Kantian, A. Micheli, P. Zoller<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 042307 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1463">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1463</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the possibility of using a dissipative process to prepare a quantum system in a desired state. We derive for any multipartite pure state a dissipative process for which this state is the unique stationary state and solve the corresponding master equation analytically. For certain states, like the Cluster states, we use this process to show that the jump operators can be chosen quasi-locally, i.e. they act non-trivially only on a few, neighboring qubits. Furthermore, the relaxation time of this dissipative process is independent of the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the general formalism by considering arbitrary MPS-PEPS states. In particular, we show that the ground state of the AKLT-model can be prepared employing a quasi--local dissipative process.

<p><strong>7.    Optical Quantum Computing</strong><br>
Jeremy L. O&#39;Brien<br>
Science, 318, 1467 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1554">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1554</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 2001 all-optical quantum computing became feasible with the discovery that scalable quantum computing is possible using only single photon sources, linear optical elements, and single photon detectors. Although it was in principle scalable, the massive resource overhead made the scheme practically daunting. However, several simplifications were followed by proof-of-principle demonstrations, and recent approaches based on cluster states or error encoding have dramatically reduced this worrying resource overhead, making an all-optical architecture a serious contender for the ultimate goal of a large-scale quantum computer. Key challenges will be the realization of high-efficiency sources of indistinguishable single photons, low-loss, scalable optical circuits, high efficiency single photon detectors, and low-loss interfacing of these components.

<p><strong>8.    Truncated su(2) moment problem for spin and polarization states</strong><br>
Tobias Moroder, Michael Keyl, Norbert Lütkenhaus<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1873">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1873</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the problem whether a given set of expectation values is compatible with the first and second moments of the generic spin operators of a system with total spin j. Those operators appear as the Stokes operator in quantum optics, as well as the total angular momentum operators in the atomic ensemble literature. We link this problem to a particular extension problem for bipartite qubit states; this problem is closely related to the symmetric extension problem that has recently drawn much attention in different contexts of the quantum information literature. We are able to provide operational, approximate solutions for every large spin numbers, and in fact the solution becomes exact in the limiting case of infinite spin numbers. Solutions for low spin numbers are formulated in terms of a hyperplane characterization, similar to entanglement witnesses, that can be efficiently solved with semidefinite programming.

<p><strong>9.    Coherent-feedback quantum control with a dynamic compensator</strong><br>
Hideo Mabuchi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2007">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2007</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
I present an experimental realization of a coherent-feedback control system that was recently proposed for testing basic principles of linear quantum stochastic control theory [M. R. James, H. I. Nurdin and I. R. Petersen, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2008), arXiv:quant-ph/0703150v2]. For a dynamical plant consisting of an optical ring-resonator, I demonstrate ~ 7 dB broadband disturbance rejection of injected laser signals via all-optical feedback with a tailored dynamic compensator. Comparison of the results with a transfer function model pinpoints critical parameters that determine the coherent-feedback control system&#39;s performance.

<p><strong>10.    Towards fault-tolerant quantum computing with trapped ions</strong><br>
J. Benhelm, G. Kirchmair, C. F. Roos, R. Blatt<br>
Nature Physics 4, 463 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2798">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2798</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today ion traps are among the most promising physical systems for constructing a quantum device harnessing the computing power inherent in the laws of quantum physics. The standard circuit model of quantum computing requires a universal set of quantum logic gates for the implementation of arbitrary quantum operations. As in classical models of computation, quantum error correction techniques enable rectification of small imperfections in gate operations, thus allowing for perfect computation in the presence of noise. For fault-tolerant computation, it is commonly believed that error thresholds ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-2 will be required depending on the noise model and the computational overhead for realizing the quantum gates. Up to now, all experimental implementations have fallen short of these requirements. Here, we report on a Molmer-Sorensen type gate operation entangling ions with a fidelity of 99.3(1)% which together with single-qubit operations forms a universal set of quantum gates. The gate operation is performed on a pair of qubits encoded in two trapped calcium ions using a single amplitude-modulated laser beam interacting with both ions at the same time. A robust gate operation, mapping separable states onto maximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically switching the laser-ion coupling on and off. We analyse the performance of a single gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations. The gate mechanism holds great promise not only for two-qubit but also for multi-qubit operations.

<p><strong>11.    Derivation of Maxwell-Bloch-type equations by projection of quantum models</strong><br>
Hideo Mabuchi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2887">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2887</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple algebraic procedure is described for deriving Maxwell-Bloch-type equations from single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) master equations via orthogonal projection onto a manifold of semiclassical states. In particular the usual Maxwell-Bloch Equations are obtained--up to a state-dependent correction factor of order unity--straightforwardly from the unconditional Jaynes-Cummings master equation. The technique of projecting onto a semiclassical manifold can also be applied with conditional master equations (quantum filters), leading to stochastic simulation models that include multiplicative noise terms associated with fluctuations of the atomic dipole. The utility of such models is briefly explored in the context of single-atom absorptive bistability.

<p><strong>12.    Codeword stabilized quantum codes: algorithm and structure</strong><br>
Isaac L. Chuang, Andrew W. Cross, Graeme Smith, John A. Smolin, Bei Zeng<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3232">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3232</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The codeword stabilized (&quot;CWS&quot;) quantum codes formalism presents a unifying approach to both additive and nonadditive quantum error-correcting codes (arXiv:0708.1021). This formalism reduces the problem of constructing such quantum codes to finding a binary classical code correcting an error pattern induced by a graph state. Finding such a classical code can be very difficult. Here, we consider an algorithm which maps the search for CWS codes to a problem of identifying maximum cliques in a graph. While solving this problem is in general very hard, we prove three structure theorems which reduce the search space, specifying certain admissible and optimal ((n,K,d)) additive codes. In particular, we find there does not exist any ((7,3,3)) CWS code though the linear programming bound does not rule it out. The complexity of the CWS search algorithm is compared with the contrasting method introduced by Aggarwal and Calderbank (arXiv:cs/0610159).

Quant. Inf. Comp. 8 (No. 10) (2008) 0925-0942<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3311">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3311</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Groverian measures are analytically computed in various types of three-qubit states. The final results are also expressed in terms of local-unitary invariant quantities in each type. This fact reflects the manifest local-unitary invariance of the Groverian measure. It is also shown that the analytical expressions for various types have correct limits to other types. For some types (type 4 and type 5) we failed to compute the analytical expression of the Groverian measure in this paper. However, from the consideration of local-unitary invariants we have shown that the Groverian measure in type 4 should be independent of the phase factor $\phi$, which appear in the three-qubit state $|\psi&gt;$. This fact with geometric interpretation on the Groverian measure may enable us to derive the analytical expressions for general arbitrary three-qubit states in near future.

<p><strong>14.    Hitting time for the continuous quantum walk</strong><br>
Martin Varbanov, Hari Krovi, Todd A. Brun<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 022324 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3446">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3446</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We define the hitting (or absorbing) time for the case of continuous quantum walks by measuring the walk at random times, according to a Poisson process with measurement rate $\lambda$. From this definition we derive an explicit formula for the hitting time, and explore its dependence on the measurement rate. As the measurement rate goes to either 0 or infinity the hitting time diverges; the first divergence reflects the weakness of the measurement, while the second limit results from the Quantum Zeno effect. Continuous-time quantum walks, like discrete-time quantum walks but unlike classical random walks, can have infinite hitting times. We present several conditions for existence of infinite hitting times, and discuss the connection between infinite hitting times and graph symmetry.

<blockquote>
<p>
Several research groups are giving special attention to quantum walks recently, because this research area have been used with success in the development of new efficient quantum algorithms. A general simulator of quantum walks is very important for the development of this area, since it allows the researchers to focus on the mathematical and physical aspects of the research instead of deviating the efforts to the implementation of specific numerical simulations. In this paper we present QWalk, a quantum walk simulator for one- and two-dimensional lattices. Finite two-dimensional lattices with generic topologies can be used. Decoherence can be simulated by performing measurements or by breaking links of the lattice. We use examples to explain the usage of the software and to show some recent results of the literature that are easily reproduced by the simulator.

<p>
The phase space is the natural ground to smoothly extrapolate between local and non-local correlation functions. With this objective, we introduce the symplectic tomography of many-body quantum gases in tight-waveguides, and concentrate on the reduced single-particle symplectic tomogram (RSPST) whose marginals are the density profile and momentum distribution. We present an operational approach to measure the RSPST from the time evolution of the density profile after shutting off the interactions in a variety of relevant situations: free expansion, fall under gravity, and oscillations in a harmonic trap. From the RSPST, the one-body density matrix of the trapped state can be reconstructed.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4290">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4290</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We are interested in the problem of characterizing the correlations that arise when performing local measurements on separate quantum systems. In a previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 010401 (2007)], we introduced an infinite hierarchy of conditions necessarily satisfied by any set of quantum correlations. Each of these conditions could be tested using semidefinite programming. We present here new results concerning this hierarchy. We prove in particular that it is complete, in the sense that any set of correlations satisfying every condition in the hierarchy has a quantum representation in terms of commuting measurements. Although our tests are conceived to rule out non-quantum correlations, and can in principle certify that a set of correlations is quantum only in the asymptotic limit where all tests are satisfied, we show that in some cases it is possible to conclude that a given set of correlations is quantum after performing only a finite number of tests. We provide a criterion to detect when such a situation arises, and we explain how to reconstruct the quantum states and measurement operators reproducing the given correlations. Finally, we present several applications of our approach. We use it in particular to bound the quantum violation of various Bell inequalities.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4453">http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4453</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Augmenting the unitary transformation which generates a quantum walk by a generalized phase gate G is a symmetry for both noisy and noiseless quantum walk on a line, in the sense that it leaves the position probability distribution invariant. However, this symmetry breaks down in the case of a quantum walk on an n-cycle, and hence can be regarded as a probe of the walk topology. Noise, modelled here as phase flip and generalized amplitude damping channels, tends to restore the symmetry because it classicalizes the walk. However, symmetry restoration happens even in the regime where the walker is not entirely classical, because noise also has the effect of desensitizing the operation G to the walk topology. We discuss methods for physical implementation, and talk about the wider implications to condensed matter systems.

Applications to the diffusion of Na atoms on flat (weakly corrugated) and corrugated-Cu(001) surfaces at different coverages and surface temperatures are analyzed. Quantum effects are relevant to diffusion at low surface temperatures and coverages even for relatively heavy particles, such as Na atoms, where transport by tunneling is absent.

Within the lowest-order Born approximation, we calculate the exact dynamics of a single qubit in the presence of 1/f noise, without making any Markov approximation. We show that the non-Markovian qubit time-evolution exhibits asymmetries and beatings that cannot be explained within a Markovian theory. The present theory for 1/f noise is relevant for both spin- and superconducting qubit realizations in solid-state devices, where 1/f noise is ubiquitous.
