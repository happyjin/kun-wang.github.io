    <p><strong>1.    Comparison of a quantum error correction threshold for exact and approximate errors</strong><br>
Mauricio Gutiérrez, Kenneth R. Brown<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 022335 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00068">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00068</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement in the noise model. We examine the feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the Steane [[7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction. However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel.

<p><strong>2.    Hyperfine spin qubits in irradiated malonic acid: heat-bath algorithmic cooling</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to perform quantum error correction is a significant hurdle for scalable quantum information processing. A key requirement for multiple-round quantum error correction is the ability to dynamically extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling is a method that uses quantum logic operations to move entropy from one subsystem to another, and permits cooling of a spin qubit below the closed system (Shannon) bound. Gamma-irradiated, $^{13}$C-labeled malonic acid provides up to 5 spin qubits: 1 spin-half electron and 4 spin-half nuclei. The nuclei are strongly hyperfine coupled to the electron and can be controlled either by exploiting the anisotropic part of the hyperfine interaction or by using pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques. The electron connects the nuclei to a heat-bath with a much colder effective temperature determined by the electron&#39;s thermal spin polarization. By accurately determining the full spin Hamiltonian and performing realistic algorithmic simulations, we show that an experimental demonstration of heat-bath algorithmic cooling beyond the Shannon bound is feasible in both 3-qubit and 5-qubit variants of this spin system. Similar techniques could be useful for polarizing nuclei in molecular or crystalline systems that allow for non-equilibrium optical polarization of the electron spin.

<p><strong>3.    Interplay between Fano resonance and $\mathcal{PT} $ symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00443">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00443</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of PT-symmetric complex potentials on the transport properties of non-Hermitian systems, which consist of an infinite linear chain and two side-coupled defect points with PT-symmetric complex on-site potentials. By analytically solving the scattering problem of two typical models, which display standard Fano resonances in the absence of non-Hermitian terms, we find that the PT-symmetric imaginary potentials can lead to some pronounced effects on transport properties of our systems, including changes from the perfect reflection to perfect transmission, and rich behaviors for the absence or existence of the prefect reflection at one and two resonant frequencies. Our study can help us to understand the interplay between the Fano resonance and PT symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems, which may be realizable in optical waveguide experiments.

<p><strong>4.    Tight bound on trace distance between a realistic device with partially indistinguishable bosons and the ideal Boson Sampling</strong><br>
V. S. Shchesnovich<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00850">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00850</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the closeness of an experimental unitary bosonic network with only partially indistinguishable bosons in an arbitrary mixed input state, in particular an experimental realization of the Boson Sampling, to the ideal bosonic network, where the measure of closeness of two networks is the trace distance between the output probability distributions. An upper bound on the trace distance to the ideal bosonic network is proven and also a bound on the difference between probabilities of an output configuration. Moreover, the upper bound on the trace distance is tight, provided that a physically transparent distinguishability conjecture is true. For a small distinguishability error it is shown that a realistic device with $N$ bosons is at a constant trace distance to the ideal Boson Sampling under the $O(N^{-1})$-scaling of the mismatch of internal states of bosons.

<p><strong>5.    Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling with Spins: Review and Prospects</strong><br>
Daniel K. Park, Nayeli A. Rodriguez-Briones, Guanru Feng, Robabeh R. Darabad, Jonathan Baugh, Raymond Laflamme<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00952">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00952</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Application of multiple rounds of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential milestone towards the construction of scalable quantum information processing devices. However, experimental realizations of it are still in their infancy. The requirements for multiple round QEC are high control fidelity and the ability to extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based quantum devices have demonstrated high control fidelity with up to 12 qubits. On the other hand, the major challenge in the NMR QEC experiment is to efficiently supply ancilla qubits in highly pure states at the beginning of each round of QEC. Purification of qubits in NMR, or in other ensemble based quantum systems can be accomplished through Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling (HBAC). It is an efficient method for extracting entropy from qubits that interact with a heat bath, allowing cooling below the bath temperature. For practical HBAC, coupled electron-nuclear spin systems are more promising than conventional NMR quantum processors, since electron spin polarization is about $10^3$ times greater than that of a proton under the same experimental conditions. We provide an overview on both theoretical and experimental aspects of HBAC focusing on spin and magnetic resonance based systems, and discuss the prospects of exploiting electron-nuclear coupled systems for the realization of HBAC and multiple round QEC.

<p><strong>6.    Linear Optical Quantum Metrology with Single Photons: Exploiting Spontaneously Generated Entanglement to Beat the Shot-Noise Limit</strong><br>
Keith R. Motes, Jonathan P. Olson, Evan J. Rabeaux, Jonathan P. Dowling, S. Jay Olson, Peter P. Rohde<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum number-path entanglement is a resource for super-sensitive quantum metrology and in particular provides for sub-shotnoise or even Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. However, such number-path entanglement has thought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place --- typically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic preparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement. Very recently, arising from the study of quantum random walks with multi-photon walkers, as well as the study of the computational complexity of passive linear optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, it has been shown that such passive linear optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount of number-path entanglement. A logical question to ask is whether this entanglement may be exploited for quantum metrology. We answer that question here in the affirmative by showing that a simple, passive, linear-optical interferometer --- fed with only uncorrelated, single-photon inputs, coupled with simple, single-mode, disjoint photodetection --- is capable of significantly beating the shotnoise limit. Our result implies a pathway forward to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology.

<p><strong>7.    Magic State Distillation and Gate Compilation in Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Chemistry</strong><br>
Colin J. Trout, Kenneth R. Brown<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01298">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01298</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry map the dynamics of electrons in a molecule to the dynamics of a coupled spin system. To reach chemical accuracy for interesting molecules, a large number of quantum gates must be applied which implies the need for quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Arbitrary fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a small, universal set of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum chemistry algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed dynamics using Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and finally approximating the single-qubit rotations by a sequence of fault-tolerant single-qubit gates. Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on the preparation of specific single-qubit states referred to as magic states. As a result, gate compilation and magic state distillation are critical for solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. We review recent progress that has improved the efficiency of gate compilation and magic state distillation by orders of magnitude.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computing exploits fundamentally new models of computation based on quantum mechanical properties instead of classical physics, and it is believed that quantum computers are able to dramatically improve computational power for particular tasks. At present, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been one of the most successful platforms amongst all current implementations. It has demonstrated universal controls on the largest number of qubits, and many advanced techniques developed in NMR have been adopted to other quantum systems successfully. In this review, we show how NMR quantum processors can satisfy the general requirements of a quantum computer, and describe advanced techniques developed towards this target. Additionally, we review some recent NMR quantum processor experiments. These experiments include benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, demonstrations of algorithms exploiting quantum properties, exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics, and quantum simulations. Finally we summarize the concepts and comment on future prospects.

<p><strong>10.    Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters</strong><br>
Dominic W. Berry, Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01715">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01715</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation that has optimal dependence on all parameters of interest (up to log factors). Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity $d$ at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error $\epsilon$. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in $\epsilon$ at the expense of poor scaling in $d$. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm achieves near-linear scaling in $\tau := d |H|_{\max} t$ and sublogarithmic scaling in $1/\epsilon$. Our dependence on $\epsilon$ is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$.

Non-classical multi-photon and number states attracts many people because of their wide applications in fundamental quantum mechanics tests, quantum metrology and quantum computation, therefore it is a longstanding aim to generate such states experimentally. Here, we prepare photon triplets by using the spontaneously Raman scattering process in a hot atomic ensemble cascaded by the spontaneous parametric down conversion process in a periodical poled nonlinear waveguide, the strong temporal correlations of these three photons are observed. Our experiment represents the first combination of the different order nonlinear processes and different physical systems, showing the feasibility of such composite system in this research direction. In addition, the all photons in the prepared genuine triplet are in telecom band make them be suitable for long-distance quantum communication in optical fibre.

<blockquote>
<p>
This paper researches how the systematic errors in phase inversions affect the success rate and the number of iterations in optimized quantum random-walk search algorithm. Through geometric description of this algorithm, the model of the algorithm with phase errors is established and the relationship between the success rate of the algorithm, the database size, the number of iterations and the phase error is depicted. For a given sized database, we give both the maximum success rate of the algorithm and the required number of iterations when the algorithm is in the presence of phase errors. Through analysis and numerical simulations, it shows that optimized quantum random-walk search algorithm is more robust than Grover&#39;s algorithm.

<p><strong>14.    Characterizing non-Markovianity via quantum interferometric power</strong><br>
Himadri Shekhar Dhar, Manabendra Nath Bera, Gerardo Adesso<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 032115 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02335">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02335</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian evolution in open quantum systems is often characterized in terms of the backflow of information from environment to system and is thus an important facet in investigating the performance and robustness of quantum information protocols. In this work, we explore non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity of a metrological figure of merit, called the quantum interferometric power, which is based on the minimal quantum Fisher information obtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system, and can be interpreted as a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity indicator in two relevant examples. First, we consider the action of a single-party dephasing channel on a maximally entangled two-qubit state, by applying the Jamio{\l}kowski-Choi isomorphism. We observe that the proposed measure is consistent with established non-Markovianity quantifiers defined using other approaches based on dynamical divisibility, distinguishability, and breakdown of monotonicity for the quantum mutual information. Further, we consider the dynamics of two-qubit Werner states, under the action of a local, single-party amplitude damping channel, and observe that the nonmonotonic evolution of the quantum interferometric power is more robust than the corresponding one for entanglement in capturing the backflow of quantum information associated with the non-Markovian process. Implications for the role of non-Markovianity in quantum metrology and possible extensions to continuous variable systems are discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate a two-way cascaded cavity QED system consisting of microtoroidal resonators coupled through an optical fiber. Each microtoroidal cavity supports two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes coupled to single atoms through their evanescent fields. We focus on a pair of atom-microtoroid systems and compute the spectrum of spontaneous emission into the fiber with one atom initially excited. Explicit results are presented for strong-coupling and bad-cavity regimes, where the latter allows the effective atom-atom interaction to be controlled through the atom-cavity coupling and detuning: the atoms exhibit either collective spontaneous emission with no dipole-dipole interaction or a (coherent) dipole-dipole interaction and independent (single-atom) emission. This capacity for switching the character of the interaction is a feature of bi-directional coupling and connects our two-way cascaded system to work on one-dimensional waveguides. Building upon our bad-cavity results, we generalize to many atom-microtoroid systems coupled through an optical fiber.

Alexei Grinbaum<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02710">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02710</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum mechanics relies on the cut between the observer and the quantum system, but it does not define the observer physically. We propose an informational definition based on bounded complexity of strings. Language dynamics then leads to an emergent continuous model in the critical regime. Restricting it to a subfamily of <code>quantum&#39; binary codes describing</code>bipartite systems&#39;, we find strong evidence of an upper bound on bipartite correlations equal to 2.82537. This is measurably different from the Tsirelson bound of the CHSH inequality. If such a reconstruction of quantum theory is experimentally confirmed, it would show that the Hilbert space formalism is but an effective description of a fundamental `linguistic&#39; theory in the critical regime.

<p><strong>17.    Anomalous behavior of the energy gap in the one-dimensional quantum XY model</strong><br>
Yuuki Yamanaka, Hidetoshi Nishimori<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02926">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02926</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show for the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model with $s=1/2$ that the energy gap between the ground and first excited states behaves anomalously as a function of the system size at the first-order quantum phase transition. Although it is generally the case that the energy gap closes exponentially at a quantum first-order transition, the gap in the present model behaves non-monotonically as a function of the system size, apparently very irregularly in some cases. This property of the gap is similar to that of the infinite-range quantum $XY$ model, in which the gap closes polynomially, exponentially, or even factorially fast depending on the choice of the series of system sizes toward the thermodynamic limit. This observation is surprising in consideration of the apparent maturity of our understanding of the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model. Our result is also important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing, where the rate of gap closing determines the efficiency of computation.

<blockquote>
<p>
All classical and quantum technologies that encode in and retrieve information from optical fields rely on the ability to selectively manipulate orthogonal field modes of light. Such manipulation can be achieved with high selectivity for polarization modes and transverse-spatial modes. For the time-frequency degree of freedom, this could efficiently be achieved for a limited choice of approximately orthogonal modes, i.e. non-overlapping bins in time or frequency. We recently proposed a method that surmounts the selectivity barrier for sorting arbitrary orthogonal temporal modes [Opt. Lett. {\bf 39}, 2924 (2014)] using cascaded interferometric quantum frequency conversion in nonlinear optical media. We call this method temporal-mode interferometry, as it has a close resemblance to the well-known separated-fields atomic interferometry method introduced by Ramsey. The method has important implications for quantum memories, quantum dense coding, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. Here we explore the inner workings of the method in detail, and extend it to multiple stages with a concurrent asymptotic convergence of temporal-mode selectivity to unity. We also complete our analysis of pump-chirp compensation to counter pump-induced nonlinear phase-modulation in four-wave mixing implementations.

We develop the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach for open systems with Neumann boundary conditions. The approach can be used for calculating the scattering matrix and the scattering function in open resonator-waveguide systems. In higher than one dimensions the method represents acoustic coupled mode theory in which the scattering solution within an open resonator is found in the form of expansion over the eigenmodes of the closed resonator decoupled from the waveguides. The problem of finding the transmission spectra is reduced to solving a set of linear equations with a non-Hermitian matrix whose anti-Hermitian term accounts for coupling between the resonator eigenmodes and the scattering channels of the waveguides. Numerical applications to acoustic two-, and three-dimensional resonator-waveguide problems are considered.

<blockquote>
<p>
A single-shot Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-NOT, gate is desirable for classical and quantum information processing. The Toffoli gate alone is universal for reversible computing and, accompanied by the Hadamard gate, forms a universal gate set for quantum computing. The Toffoli gate is also a key ingredient for (non-topological) quantum error correction. Currently Toffoli gates are achieved by decomposing into sequentially implemented single- and two-qubit gates, which requires much longer times and yields lower overall fidelities compared to a single-shot implementation. We develop a quantum-control procedure to construct a single-shot Toffoli gate for three nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems such that the fidelity is 99.9% and is as fast as an entangling two-qubit gate under the same realistic conditions. The gate is achieved by a non-greedy quantum control procedure using our enhanced version of the Differential Evolution algorithm.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this work, strongly complementary observables are shown to provide an abstract characterisation of Fourier transform and representation theory in Categorical Quantum Mechanics. Our starting point is the observation that the Fourier transform can be seen as an isomorphism of internal monoids in $\operatorname{Hilb}$ between convolution and pointwise multiplication. We proceed to generalise the necessary tools of representation theory from $\operatorname{Hilb}$ to arbitrary $\dagger$-compact monoidal categories: we define groups, characters and representations, and we prove their relation to strong complementarity. We define the Fourier transform in terms of pairs of strongly complementary observables, in both the abelian and non-abelian case. We draw the connection with Pontryagin duality and the theory of unitary symmetries of systems, linking observables to the conserved quantities associated with dynamics. Finally, our work finds application in the novel characterisation of the Fourier transform for the category $\operatorname{Rel}$ of sets and relations. This is a result of great interest for the study of categorical quantum algorithms, as the usual construction of the quantum Fourier transform in terms of Hadamard matrices is shown to fail in $\operatorname{Rel}$.

The photon performs a quantum walk on an array of optical elements, where the polarisation-dependent translation is performed via birefringent beam displacers and a change of the polarisation is implemented with the help of wave-plates. We implement: (i) Trine-POVM, i.e., the POVM elements uniformly distributed on an equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere; (ii) Symmetric-Informationally- Complete (SIC) POVM; and (iii) Unambiguous Discrimination of two non-orthogonal qubit states.

<blockquote>
<p>
It is theoretically and experimentally shown that photons emitted by statistically independent incoherent classical light sources and measured in the far field in spatially separated modes may display spatial correlations akin to path-entanglement of photons produced by quantum sources. By measuring higher order photon-correlations at different locations, i.e., $m$ photons in one mode and one photon in another mode, we experimentally demonstrate for $m \geq 6$ a violation of Bell-type inequalities for spatial degrees of freedom. The spatial correlations among the photons can be understood from state projection where the detection of the first $m$ photons projects the sources onto a state which emits the subsequent photon in a strongly correlated manner. From this perspective the entanglement and violation of Bell&#39;s inequalities appears as a consequence of nonvanishing cross correlations between noncommuting quadrature phase components of the two spatially separated fields after $m$ photons have been recorded. In this way we show that classical systems may produce spatial field correlations violating local realistic theories.

<blockquote>
<p>
A short quantum Markov chain is a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ such that system $A$ can be recovered perfectly by acting on system $C$ of the reduced state $\rho_{BC}$. Such states have conditional mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ equal to zero and are the only states with this property. A quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ if there exists a recovery channel using which one can perfectly recover $\rho$ from $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ and $\sigma$ from $\mathcal{N}(\sigma)$. The relative entropy difference $D(\rho\Vert\sigma)-D(\mathcal{N}(\rho)\Vert\mathcal{N}(\sigma))$ is equal to zero if and only if $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for $\rho$ and $\sigma$. In this paper, we show that these properties extend to Renyi generalizations of these information measures which were proposed in [Berta et al., J. Math. Phys. 56, 022205, (2015) and arXiv:1410.1443], thus providing an alternate characterization of short quantum Markov chains and sufficient quantum channels. These results give further support to these quantities as being legitimate Renyi generalizations of the conditional mutual information and the relative entropy difference. Along the way, we solve some open questions of Ruskai and Zhang, regarding the trace of particular matrices that arise in the study of monotonicity of relative entropy under quantum operations and strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy.

<p>
Discrete time quantum walks (DTQWs) are nontrivial generalizations of random walks with a broad scope of applications. In particular, they can be used as computational primitives, and they are suitable tools for simulating other quantum systems. DTQWs usually spread ballistically due to their quantumness. In some cases, however, they can remain localized at their initial state (trapping). The trapping and other fundamental properties of DTQWs are determined by the choice of the coin operator. We introduce and analyze an up to now uncharted type of walks driven by a coin class leading to strong trapping, complementing the known list of walks. This class of walks exhibit a number of exciting properties with the possible applications ranging from light pulse trapping in a medium to topological effects and quantum search.

Solving realistic quantum systems coupled to an environment is a challenging task.

An explicit expression for arbitrary order HFD equation is derived systematically. Moreover, it is found that for an analytically solvable model, this hierarchical equation naturally terminates at a given order and thus becomes exactly solvable. This HFD approach provides a systematic method to study the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of an open system coupled to a bosonic environment.

<p>
Escaping from a complex maze, by exploring different paths with several decision-making branches in order to reach the exit, has always been a very challenging and fascinating task. Wave field and quantum objects may explore a complex structure in parallel by interference effects, but without necessarily leading to more efficient transport. Here, inspired by recent observations in biological energy transport phenomena, we demonstrate how a quantum walker can efficiently reach the output of a maze by partially suppressing the presence of interference. In particular, we show theoretically an unprecedented improvement in transport efficiency for increasing maze size with respect to purely quantum and classical approaches. In addition, we investigate experimentally these hybrid transport phenomena, by mapping the maze problem in an integrated waveguide array, probed by coherent light, hence successfully testing our theoretical results. These achievements may lead towards future bio-inspired photonics technologies for more efficient transport and computation.

<p>
Although a number of measures for quantum non-Markovianity have been proposed recently, it is still an open question whether these measures directly characterize the memory effect of the environment, i.e., the dependence of a quantum state on its past in a time evolution. In this paper, we present a criterion and propose a measure for non-Markovianity with clear physical interpretations of the memory effect. The non-Markovianity is defined by the inequality $T(t_2,t_0)\neq T(t_2,t_1)T(t_1,t_0)$ in terms of memoryless dynamical map $T$ introduced in this paper. This definition is conceptually distinct from that based on divisibility used by Rivas et al (Phys. Rev. Lett 105, 050403 (2010)), whose violation is manifested by non-complete positivity of the dynamical map. We demonstrate via a typical quantum process that without Markovian approximation, nonzero memory effects (non-Markovianity) always exist even if the non-Markovianity is zero by the other non-Marovianity measures.

Quantum discord expresses a fundamental non-classicality of correlations more general than quantum entanglement. We combine the no-local-broadcasting theorem, semidefinite-programming characterizations of quantum fidelity and quantum separability, and a recent breakthrough result of Fawzi and Renner about quantum Markov chains to provide a hierarchy of computationally efficient lower bounds to quantum discord. Such a hierarchy converges to the surprisal of measurement recoverability introduced by Seshadreesan and Wilde, and provides a faithful lower bound to quantum discord already at the lowest non-trivial level. Furthermore, the latter constitutes by itself a valid discord-like measure of the quantumness of correlations.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks can be defined in two quite distinct ways: discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks (DTQWs and CTQWs). For classical random walks, there is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of discrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an additional &quot;coin space&quot; must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time evolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints. This means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a limit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this problem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on $d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian: from a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a well-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this limit as a {\it coined} continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share some properties with coined DTQWs. In particular, we look at spatial search by a DTQW over the 2-D torus (a grid with periodic boundary conditions) of size $\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$, where it was shown \nocite{AAmbainis08} that a coined DTQW can search in time $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$, but a standard CTQW \nocite{Childs2004} takes $\Omega(N)$ time to search for a marked element. The continuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from. We also look at the effects of graph symmetry on the limiting walk, and show that the properties are similar to those of the DTQW as shown in \cite{HariKrovi2007}.

A coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on a multiple-pulse degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) is evaluated for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The underlying mechanism of CIM originates from the bistable phase bifurcation at DOPO phase transition and the inherent preference of the coupled DOPOs in selecting an oscillation mode with the minimum photon decay rate. This paper presents the theoretical model and numerical simulation results of the proposed machine. Computational experiments are performed on NP-hard MAX-CUT problems with number of vertices up to $2 \times 10^4$ and number of edges up to $10^8$. The numerical simulation results suggest the substantial speed-up for obtaining the reasonably good solution of MAX-CUT problems on a CIM against traditional algorithms such as semidefinite programming of Goemans-Williamson and simulated annealing by Kirkpatrick, et al.

<p>
The most elementary quantum walk is characterized by a 2-dimensional unitary coin flip matrix, which can be parameterized by 4 real variables. The influence of the choice of the coin flip matrix on the time evolution operator is analysed in a systematic way. By changing the coin parameters, the dispersion and asymmetry of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator can be tuned in a controlled way. The reduced eigenvectors in coin space are distributed along trajectories on the surface or inside the Bloch sphere, depending on the degeneracy of the spectrum. At certain values of the coin parameters the spectrum of the time evolution operator becomes 2-fold degenerate, but there might exist unique eigenvalues at the top and bottom of each quasi-energy band. The eigenstates corresponding to such eigenvalues are robust against arbitrary temporal variations in the bias parameter of the coin, as long as rest of the parameters remain unchanged.

The non-Markovianity is a prominent concept of the dynamics of the open quantum systems, which is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics and quantum information. Despite of lots of efforts, the experimentally measuring of non-Markovianity of an open system is still limited to very small systems. Presently, it is still impossible to experimentally quantify the non-Markovianity of high dimension systems with the widely used Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) trace distance measure. In this paper, we propose a method, combining experimental measurements and numerical calculations, that allow quantifying the non-Markovianity of a $N$ dimension system only scaled as $N^2$, successfully avoid the exponential scaling with the dimension of the open system in the current method. After the benchmark with a two-dimension open system, we demonstrate the method in quantifying the non-Markovanity of a high dimension open quantum random walk system.

For illustration, we specialize our findings for the case of the dynamics of single qubit amplitude damping channels. The optimal control strategy presented here can be used to implement optimal cooling processes in quantum technologies and may have implications in quantum thermodynamics when assessing the efficiency of thermal micro-machines.

Quantum walks have been very successful in the development of search algorithms in quantum information, in particular in the development of spatial search algorithms. However, the construction of continuous-time quantum search algorithms in two-dimensional lattices has proved difficult, requiring additional degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-time quantum walk search is possible in two-dimensions by changing the search topology to a graphene lattice, utilising the Dirac point in the energy spectrum. This is made possible by making a change to standard methods of marking a particular site in the lattice. Various ways of marking a site are shown to result in successful search protocols. We further establish that the search can be adapted to transfer probability amplitude across the lattice between specific lattice sites thus establishing a line of communication between these sites.

We give close-form formulae of the fidelity when the two states are both pure states, or a pure product state and the Werner state. We explain from the point of view of local unitary actions that why the entanglement in Werner states is hard to accessible.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dynamics of rotational excitations placed on a single molecule in spatially disordered 1D, 2D and 3D ensembles of ultracold molecules trapped in optical lattices. The disorder arises from incomplete populations of optical lattices with molecules. This leads to a model corresponding to a quantum particle with long-range tunnelling amplitudes moving on a lattice with the same on-site energy but with forbidden access to random sites (vacancies). We examine the time and length scales of Anderson localization for this type of disorder with realistic experimental parameters in the Hamiltonian. We show that for an experimentally realized system of KRb molecules on an optical lattice this type of disorder leads to disorder-induced localization in 1D and 2D systems on a time scale $t \sim 1$ sec. For 3D lattices with $55$ sites in each dimension and vacancy concentration $ 90~\%$, the rotational excitations diffuse to the edges of the lattice and show no signature of Anderson localization. We examine the role of the long-range tunnelling amplitudes allowing for transfer of rotational excitations between distant lattice sites. Our results show that the long-range tunnelling has little impact on the dynamics in the diffusive regime but affects significantly the localization dynamics in lattices with large concentrations of vacancies, enhancing the width of the localized distributions in 2D lattices by more than a factor of 2. Our results raise a general question whether quantum particles with long-range tunnelling can undergo quantum localization in 3D lattices with substitutional disorder.

We show that graphene possesses a strong nonlinear optical response in the form of multi-plasmon absorption, with exciting implications in classical and quantum nonlinear optics. Specifically, we predict that graphene nano-ribbons can be used as saturable absorbers with low saturation intensity in the far-infrared and terahertz spectrum. Moreover, we predict that two-plasmon absorption and extreme localization of plasmon fields in graphene nano-disks can lead to a plasmon blockade effect, in which a single quantized plasmon strongly suppresses the possibility of exciting a second plasmon.

<p><strong>50.    Parameterized quantum field theory without Haag&#39;s theorem</strong><br>
Ed Seidewitz<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05658">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05658</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Under the normal assumptions of quantum field theory, Haag&#39;s theorem states that any field unitarily equivalent to a free field must itself be a free field. Unfortunately, the derivation of the Dyson series perturbation expansion relies on the use of the interaction picture, in which the interacting field is unitarily equivalent to the free field but must still account for interactions. Thus, the traditional perturbative derivation of the scattering matrix in quantum field theory is mathematically ill defined. Nevertheless, perturbative quantum field theory is currently the only practical approach for addressing scattering for realistic interactions, and it has been spectacularly successful in making empirical predictions. This paper explains this success by showing that quantum field theory can be formulated, using an invariant, fifth path parameter in addition to the usual four position parameters, in such a way that Haag&#39;s theorem no longer applies, but such that the Dyson perturbation expansion for the scattering matrix can still be reproduced, term by term. As a result, the parameterized formalism provides a consistent foundation for the interpretation of quantum field theory as used in practice and, perhaps, for better dealing with other mathematical issues, such as renormalization.

<p><strong>51.    Observation of many-body localization of interacting fermions in a quasi-random optical lattice</strong><br>
Michael Schreiber, Sean S. Hodgman, Pranjal Bordia, Henrik P. Lüschen, Mark H. Fischer, Ronen Vosk, Ehud Altman, Ulrich Schneider, Immanuel Bloch<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally observe many-body localization of interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-random optical lattice. We identify the many-body localization transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially-prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all remnants of the initial order. In contrast, above a critical disorder strength a significant portion of the initial ordering persists, thereby serving as an effective order parameter for localization. The stationary density wave order and the critical disorder value show a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, in agreement with numerical simulations. We connect this dependence to the ubiquitous logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy characterizing the generic many-body localized phase.

<p><strong>52.    Jarzynski equality in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics</strong><br>
Sebastian Deffner, Avadh Saxena<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 150601 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06545">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06545</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the quantum Jarzynski equality generalizes to $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. In the regime of broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry the Jarzynski equality does not hold as also the $\mathcal{CPT}$-norm is not preserved during the dynamics. These findings are illustrated for an experimentally relevant system -- two coupled optical waveguides. It turns out that for these systems the phase transition between the regimes of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is thermodynamically inhibited as the irreversible work diverges at the critical point.

<p><strong>53.    Bulk-Boundary Duality, Gauge Invariance, and Quantum Error Correction</strong><br>
Eric Mintun, Joseph Polchinski, Vladimir Rosenhaus<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06577">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06577</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow have argued that the localization of bulk information in a boundary dual should be understood in terms of quantum error correction. We show that this structure appears naturally when the gauge invariance of the boundary theory is incorporated. This provides a new understanding of the non-uniqueness of the bulk fields (precursors). It suggests a close connection between gauge invariance and the emergence of spacetime.
