<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum technologies based on photons are anticipated in the areas of information processing, communication, metrology, and lithography. While there have been impressive proof-of-principle demonstrations in all of these areas, future technologies will likely require an integrated optics architecture for improved performance, miniaturization and scalability. We demonstrated high- fidelity silica-on-silicon integrated optical realizations of key quantum photonic circuits, including two-photon quantum interference with a visibility of 94.8(5)%; a controlled-NOT gate with logical basis fidelity of 94.3(2)%; and a path entangled state of two photons with fidelity &gt;92%.

<p><strong>2.    Two-qutrit Entanglement Witnesses and Gell-Mann Matrices</strong><br>
M. A. Jafarizadeh, Y. Akbari, N. Behzadi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0270">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0270</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Gell-Mann $\lambda$ matrices for Lie algebra su(3) are the natural basis for the Hilbert space of Hermitian operators acting on the states of a three-level system(qutrit). So the construction of EWs for two-qutrit states by using these matrices may be an interesting problem. In this paper, several two-qutrit EWs are constructed based on the Gell-Mann matrices by using the linear programming (LP) method exactly or approximately. The decomposability and non-decomposability of constructed EWs are also discussed and it is shown that the $\lambda$-diagonal EWs presented in this paper are all decomposable but there exist non-decomposable ones among $\lambda$-non-diagonal EWs.

<p><strong>3.    Universal quantum walks and adiabatic algorithms by 1D Hamiltonians</strong><br>
Bradley A. Chase, Andrew J. Landahl<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1207">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1207</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a family of time-independent nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians coupling eight-state systems on a 1D ring that enables universal quantum computation. Hamiltonians in this family can achieve universality either by driving a continuous-time quantum walk or by terminating an adiabatic algorithm. In either case, the universality property can be understood as arising from an efficient simulation of a programmable quantum circuit. Using gadget perturbation theory, one can demonstrate the same kind of universality for related Hamiltonian families acting on qubits in 2D. Our results demonstrate that simulating 1D chains of spin-7/2 particles is BQP-hard, and indeed BQP-complete because the outputs of decision problems can be encoded in the outputs of such simulations.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1441">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1441</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present the first quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate realized using a fiber-based indistinguishable photon-pair source in the 1.55 $\mu$m telecommunications band. Using this free-space CNOT gate, all four Bell states are produced and fully characterized by performing quantum state tomography, demonstrating the gate&#39;s unambiguous entangling capability and high fidelity. Telecom-band operation makes this CNOT gate particularly suitable for quantum information processing tasks that are at the interface of quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing.

<p><strong>5.    Random Quantum Circuits are Approximate 2-designs</strong><br>
Aram W. Harrow, Richard A. Low<br>
Comm. Math. Phys. Vol. 291, No. 1, pp. 257--302 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1919">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1919</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a universal gate set on two qubits, it is well known that applying random gates from the set to random pairs of qubits will eventually yield an approximately Haar-distributed unitary. However, this requires exponential time. We show that random circuits of only polynomial length will approximate the first and second moments of the Haar distribution, thus forming approximate 1- and 2-designs. Previous constructions required longer circuits and worked only for specific gate sets. As a corollary of our main result, we also improve previous bounds on the convergence rate of random walks on the Clifford group.

<p>
We implement a photon-counting Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) at 1.55um which exhibits a high 2-point resolution and a high accuracy. It is based on a low temporal-jitter photon-counting module at 1.55um. This detector is composed of a periodically poled Lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide, which provides a wavelength conversion from near infrared to visible light, and a low jitter silicon photon-counting detector. With this apparatus, we obtain centimetre resolution over a measurement range of tens of kilometres.

<p><strong>7.    Exact stochastic simulation of dissipation and non-Markovian effects in open quantum systems</strong><br>
Denis Lacroix<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1981">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1981</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The exact dynamics of a system coupled to an environment can be described by an integro-differential stochastic equation of its reduced density. The influence of the environment is incorporated through a mean-field which is both stochastic and non-local in time and where the standard two-times correlation functions of the environment appear naturally. Since no approximation is made, the presented theory incorporates exactly dissipative and non-Markovian effects. Applications to the spin-boson model coupled to a heat-bath with various coupling regimes and temperature show that the presented stochastic theory can be a valuable tool to simulate exactly the dynamics of open quantum systems. Links with stochastic Schroedinger equation method and possible extensions to &quot;imaginary time&quot; propagation are discussed.

<p><strong>8.    Large Qudit Limit of One-dimensional Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Mitsunori Sato, Naoki Kobayashi, Makoto Katori, Norio Konno<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1997">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1997</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a series of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum-walk models labeled by half integers $j=1/2, 1, 3/2, ...$, introduced by Miyazaki {\it et al.}, each of which the walker&#39;s wave function has $2j+1$ components and hopping range at each time step is $2j$. In long-time limit the density functions of pseudovelocity-distributions are generally given by superposition of appropriately scaled Konno&#39;s density function. Since Konno&#39;s density function has a finite open support and it diverges at the boundaries of support, limit distribution of pseudovelocities in the $(2j+1)$-component model can have $2j+1$ pikes, when $2j+1$ is even. When $j$ becomes very large, however, we found that these pikes vanish and a universal and monotone convex structure appears around the origin in limit distributions. We discuss a possible route from quantum walks to classical diffusion associated with the $j \to \infty$ limit.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum information processing with single photons and atomic ensembles in microwave coplanar waveguide resonators</strong><br>
David Petrosyan, Michael Fleischhauer<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 170501 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2154">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2154</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that pairs of atoms optically excited to the Rydberg states can strongly interact with each other via effective long-range dipole-dipole or van der Waals interactions mediated by their non-resonant coupling to a common microwave field mode of a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. These cavity mediated interactions can be employed to generate single photons and to realize in a scalable configuration a universal phase gate between pairs of single photon pulses propagating or stored in atomic ensembles in the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the quantum walk in momentum space using a coin arranged in quasi-periodic sequences following a Fibonacci prescription. We build for this system a classical map based on the trace of the evolution operator. The sub-ballistic behavior of this quantum walk is connected with the power-law decay of the time correlations of the trace map.

<p><strong>11.    Classical Enhancement of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</strong><br>
Isaac Kremsky, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Todd A. Brun<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 012341 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2414">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2414</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general formalism for quantum error-correcting codes that encode both classical and quantum information (the EACQ formalism). This formalism unifies the entanglement-assisted formalism and classical error correction, and includes encoding, error correction, and decoding steps such that the encoded quantum and classical information can be correctly recovered by the receiver. We formally define this kind of quantum code using both stabilizer and symplectic language, and derive the appropriate error-correcting conditions. We give several examples to demonstrate the construction of such codes.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2457">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2457</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The visualization of an exceptional point in a PT symmetric directional coupler(DC) is demonstrated. In such a system the exceptional point can be probed by varying only a single parameter. Using the Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory we prove that the spectrum of a PT symmetric Hamiltonian is real as long as the radius of convergence has not been reached. We also show how one can use a PT symmetric DC to measure the radius of convergence for non PT symmetric structures. For such systems the physical meaning of the rather mathematical term: radius of convergence, is exemplified.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2698">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2698</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The low-temperature behavior of the Casimir-Polder free energy and entropy for an atom near a dielectric plate are found on the basis of the Lifshitz theory. The obtained results are shown to be thermodynamically consistent if the dc conductivity of the plate material is disregarded. With inclusion of dc conductivity, both the standard Lifshitz theory (for all dielectrics) and its generalization taking into account screening effects (for a wide range of dielectrics) violate the Nernst heat theorem. The inclusion of the screening effects is also shown to be inconsistent with experimental data of Casimir force measurements. The physical reasons for this inconsistency are elucidated.

<p>
One-parameter family of discrete-time quantum-walk models on the square lattice, which includes the Grover-walk model as a special case, is analytically studied. Convergence in the long-time limit $t \to \infty$ of all joint moments of two components of walker&#39;s pseudovelocity, $X_t/t$ and $Y_t/t$, is proved and the probability density of limit distribution is derived. Dependence of the two-dimensional limit density function on the parameter of quantum coin and initial four-component qudit of quantum walker is determined. Symmetry of limit distribution on a plane and localization around the origin are completely controlled. Comparison with numerical results of direct computer-simulations is also shown.

We show how a quantum walk can be implemented for the first time in a quantum quincunx created via superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), and how interpolation from quantum to random walk is implemented by controllable decoherence using a two resonator system. Direct control over the coin qubit is difficult to achieve in either cavity or circuit QED, but we show that a Hadamard coin flip can be effected via direct driving of the cavity, with the result that the walker jumps between circles in phase space but still exhibits quantum walk behavior over 15 steps.

We analytically and numerically study the effects of pulsed control on the decoherence of a qubit coupled to a quantum spin bath. When the environment is critical, decoherence is faster and we show that the control is relatively more effective. Two coupling models are investigated, namely a qubit coupled to a bath via a single link and a spin star model, yielding results that are similar and consistent.

<p>
We provide a simple and realistic model to study memory effects in a lossy bosonic quantum channel over arbitrary number of uses. The noise correlation among different uses is introduced by contiguous modes interactions which results in an exponential decay of the correlations over channel uses (modes). This model allows us to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the channel for classical information transmission.

<p><strong>18.    Dynamical kickback and non commuting impurities in a spin chain</strong><br>
Diego de Falco, Dario Tamascelli<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3567">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3567</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In an interacting continuous time quantum walk, while the walker (the cursor) is moving on a graph, computational primitives (unitary operators associated with the edges) are applied to ancillary qubits (the register). The model with one walker was originally proposed by R. Feynman, who thus anticipated many features of the Continuous Time Quantum Walk (CTWQ) computing paradigm. In this note we examine the behaviour of an interacting CTQW with two walkers and examine the interaction of the walkers with noncommuting primitives. We endow such a walk with a notion of trajectory, in the sense of sample path of an associated Markov process, in order to use such notions as sojourn time and first passage time as heuristic tools for gaining intuition about its behaviour.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3749">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3749</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a variation of the quantum walk on a circle in phase space by conjoining the Hadamard coin flip with simultaneous displacement of the walker&#39;s location in phase space and show that this generalization is a proper quantum walk albeit over multiple concentric circles in phase instead of just over one circle. We motivate the conjoining of Hadamard and displacement operations by showing that the Jaynes-Cummings model for coin+walker approximately yields this description in the dispersive limit. The quantum walk signature is evident in the phase distribution of the walker provided that appropriate pulse durations are applied for each coin flip.

Francesco Buscemi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.4327">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.4327</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The action of a channel on a quantum system, when non trivial, always causes deterioration of initial quantum resources, understood as the entanglement initially shared by the input system with some reference purifying it. One effective way to measure such a deterioration is by measuring the loss of coherent information, namely the difference between the initial coherent information and the final one: such a difference is <code>small&#39;&#39;, if and only if the action of the channel can be</code>almost perfectly&#39;&#39; corrected with probability one. In this work, we generalise this result to different entanglement loss functions, notably including the entanglement of formation loss, and prove that many inequivalent entanglement measures lead to equivalent conditions for approximate quantum error correction. In doing this, we show how different measures of bipartite entanglement give rise to corresponding distance-like functions between quantum channels, and we investigate how these induced distances are related to the cb-norm.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the effect of nonlinearity in a system described by an adiabatically evolving Hamiltonian. Experiments are conducted in a three-core waveguide structure that is adiabatically varying with distance, in analogy to the STIRAP process in atomic physics. In the linear regime, the system exhibits an adiabatic power transfer between two waveguides which are not directly coupled, with negligible power recorded in the intermediate coupling waveguide. In the presence of nonlinearity the behavior of this configuration is drastically altered and the adiabatic light passage is found to critically depend on the excitation power. We show how this effect is related to the destruction of the dark state formed in the STIRAP configuration.
