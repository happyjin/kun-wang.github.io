    <p><strong>1.    The Ising ferromagnet as a self-correcting physical memory: a Monte-Carlo study</strong><br>
Francesca Valery Day, Sean Barrett<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0390">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0390</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The advent of quantum computing has heralded a renewed interest in physical memories - physically realizable structures that offer reliable data storage with error correction only at the point of access. Here, we examine a model of a classical physical memory, capable of storing a classical bit, based on the ferromagnetic Ising model on 1- and 2-dimensional square lattices. We make use of Monte-Carlo simulations as well as analytic solutions in the high temperature limit. At high temperatures, both 1- and 2-D Ising models behave like a non-interacting model, albeit with a reduced effective number of spins and a reduced effective spin-flip rate. In agreement with general arguments, we confirm numerically that (i) the information storage time is independent of system size in 1D, (ii) in two dimensions, at temperatures below the Onsager phase transition temperature T, the information storage time increases exponentially with system size. Interestingly, some benefit in increasing system size is found even above T, although the increase in lifetime is not exponential.

<p><strong>2.    Interplay of quantum stochastic and dynamical maps to discern Markovian and non-Markovian transitions</strong><br>
A. R. Usha Devi, A. K. Rajagopal, Sudha, R. W. Rendell<br>
Journal of Quantum Information Science, Vol 2, 47-54 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0477">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0477</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that the dynamical evolution of a system, from an initial tensor product state of system and environment, to any two later times, t1,t2 (t2&gt;t1), are both completely positive (CP) but in the intermediate times between t1 and t2 it need not be CP. This reveals the key to the Markov (if CP) and nonMarkov (if it is not CP) avataras of the intermediate dynamics. This is brought out here in terms of the quantum stochastic map A and the associated dynamical map B -- without resorting to master equation approaches. We investigate these features with four examples which have entirely different physical origins (i) a two qubit Werner state map with time dependent noise parameter (ii) Phenomenological model of a recent optical experiment (Nature Physics, 7, 931 (2011)) on the open system evolution of photon polarization. (iii) Hamiltonian dynamics of a qubit coupled to a bath of $N$ qubits and (iv) two qubit unitary dynamics of Jordan et. al. (Phys. Rev. A 70, 052110 (2004)) with initial product states of qubits. In all these models, it is shown that the positivity/negativity of the eigenvalues of intermediate time dynamical B map determines the Markov/non-Markov nature of the dynamics.

<p><strong>3.    An improved formalism for the Grover search algorithm</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1707">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1707</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Grover search algorithm is one of the two key algorithms in the field of quantum computing, and hence it is of significant interest to describe it in the most efficient mathematical formalism. We show firstly, that Clifford&#39;s formalism of geometric algebra, provides a significantly more efficient representation than the conventional Bra-ket notation, and secondly, that the basis defined by the states of maximum and minimum weight in the Grover search space, allows a simple visualization of the Grover search as the precession of a spin-1/2 particle. Using this formalism we efficiently solve the exact search problem, as well as easily representing more general search situations.

<p>
A quantum coherent interface between optical and microwave photons can be used as a basic building block within a future quantum information network. The interface is envisioned as an ensemble of rare-earth ions coupled to a superconducting resonator, allowing for coherent transfer between optical and microwave photons. Towards this end, we have realized a hybrid device coupling a Er$^{3+}$ doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal in a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. We observe a collective spin coupling of 4 MHz and a spin linewdith of down to 75 MHz.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show a systematic construction for implementing general measurements on a single qubit, including both strong (or projection) and weak measurements. We mainly focus on linear optical qubits. The present approach is composed of simple and feasible elements, i.e., beam splitters, wave plates, and polarizing beam splitters. We show how the parameters characterizing the measurement operators are controlled by the linear optical elements. We also propose a method for the implementation of general measurements in solid-state qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate heralded single photon generation in a CMOS-compatible silicon nanophotonic device. The strong modal confinement and slow group velocity provided by a coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) produced a large four-wave-mixing nonlinearity coefficient gamma_eff ~4100 W^-1 m^-1 at telecommunications wavelengths. Spontaneous four-wave-mixing using a degenerate pump beam at 1549.6 nm created photon pairs at 1529.5 nm and 1570.5 nm with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 20. A photon correlation measurement of the signal (1529.5 nm) photons heralded by the detection of the idler (1570.5 nm) photons showed antibunching with g^(2)(0) = 0.19 \pm 0.03. The demonstration of a single photon source within a silicon platform holds promise for future integrated quantum photonic circuits.

<p><strong>7.    Two-photon path-entangled states in multi-mode waveguides</strong><br>

<p>
We experimentally show that two-photon path-entangled states can be coherently manipulated by multi-mode interference in multi-mode waveguides. By measuring the output two-photon spatial correlation function versus the phase of the input state, we show that multi-mode waveguides perform as nearly-ideal multi-port beam splitters at the quantum level, creating a large variety of entangled and separable multi-path two-photon states.

<p><strong>8.    Photon correlations in multi-mode waveguides</strong><br>
Eilon Poem, Yaron Silberberg<br>
Phys. Rev. A 84, 041805(R) (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3799">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3799</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the propagation of classical and non-classical light in multi-mode optical waveguides. We focus on the evolution of the few-photon correlation functions, which, much like the light-intensity distribution in such systems, evolve in a periodic manner, culminating in the &#39;revival&#39; of the initial correlation pattern at the end of each period. It is found that when the input state possesses non trivial symmetries, the correlation revival period can be longer than that of the intensity, and thus the same intensity pattern can display different correlation patterns. We experimentally demonstrate this effect for classical, pseudo-thermal light, and compare the results with the predictions for non-classical, quantum light.

<p><strong>9.    The elusive Heisenberg limit in quantum enhanced metrology</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We provide efficient and intuitive tools for deriving bounds on achievable precision in quantum enhanced metrology based on the geometry of quantum channels and semi-definite programming. We show that when decoherence is taken into account, the maximal possible quantum enhancement amounts generically to a constant factor rather than quadratic improvement. We apply these tools to derive bounds for models of decoherence relevant for metrological applications including: dephasing,depolarization, spontaneous emission and photon loss.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4251">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4251</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate how the interplay between a staggered magnetic field and staggered coupling strength affects both ground state and thermal entanglement. Upon analytically calculating thermodynamic quantities and the correlation functions for such a system, we consider both the global Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement and the concurrence between pairs of spins. We discover two quantum phase transitions present in the model and show that the quantum phase transitions are reflected in the behaviour of the entanglement at zero temperature. We discover that increasing the alternating field and alternating coupling strength can actually increase the amount of entanglement present at both zero temperature and for thermal states of the system.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4303">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4303</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a class of nonlinear waveguide arrays where the waveguides are endowed with quadratic non- linearity and are coupled through the evanescent overlap of the guided modes. We study both the stimulated and spontaneous process in the array and show the viability of such an array as a platform for generating both bipartite and tripartite continuous variable entanglement on demand. We explicitly address the affect of realistic losses on the entanglement produced, briefly discuss the possible types of nonlinear materials that could be used, and suggest solutions to the possible phase matching issues in the waveguides. The simultaneous generation and manipulation of the light on a single waveguide chip circumvents the usual bandwidth problems associated with the use of external bulky optical elements and makes this avenue promising for further investigation.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4379">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4379</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction in general is experimentally challenging as it requires significant expansion of the size of quantum circuits and accurate performance of quantum gates to fulfill the error threshold requirement. Here we propose a method much simpler for experimental implementation to correct arbitrary detection errors. The method is based on processing of data from repetitive experiments and can correct detection error of any magnitude, as long as the error magnitude is calibrated. The method is illustrated with its application to detection of multipartite entanglement from quantum state engineering.

Quantum walks, the quantum mechanical counterpart of classical random walks, is an advanced tool for building quantum algorithms that has been recently shown to constitute a universal model of quantum computation. Quantum walks is now a solid field of research of quantum computation full of exciting open problems for physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers. In this paper we review theoretical advances on the foundations of both discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks, together with the role that randomness plays in quantum walks, the connections between the mathematical models of coined discrete quantum walks and continuous quantum walks, the quantumness of quantum walks, a summary of papers published on discrete quantum walks and entanglement as well as a succinct review of experimental proposals and realizations of discrete-time quantum walks. Furthermore, we have reviewed several algorithms based on both discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks as well as a most important result: the computational universality of both continuous- and discrete- time quantum walks.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4839">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4839</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks subject to decoherence generically suffer the loss of their genuine quantum feature, a quadratically faster spreading compared to classical random walks. This intuitive statement has been verified analytically for certain models and is also supported by numerical studies of a variety of examples. In this paper we analyze the long-time behavior of a particular class of decoherent quantum walks, which, to the best of our knowledge, was only studied at the level of numerical simulations before. We consider a local coin operation which is randomly and independently chosen for each time step and each lattice site and prove that, under rather mild conditions, this leads to classical behavior: With the same scaling as needed for a classical diffusion the position distribution converges to a Gaussian, which is independent of the initial state. Our method is based on non-degenerate perturbation theory and yields an explicit expression for the covariance matrix of the asymptotic Gaussian in terms of the randomness parameters.

<p><strong>15.    Efficient classical simulations of quantum Fourier transforms and normalizer circuits over Abelian groups</strong><br>
M. Van den Nest<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4867">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4867</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is sometimes said to be the source of various exponential quantum speed-ups. In this paper we introduce a class of quantum circuits which cannot outperform classical computers even though the QFT constitutes an essential component. More precisely, we consider normalizer circuits. A normalizer circuit over a finite Abelian group is any quantum circuit comprising the QFT over the group, gates which compute automorphisms and gates which realize quadratic functions on the group. We prove that all normalizer circuits have polynomial-time classical simulations. The proof uses algorithms for linear diophantine equation solving and the monomial matrix formalism introduced in our earlier work. We subsequently discuss several aspects of normalizer circuits. First we show that our result generalizes the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Furthermore we highlight connections to Shor&#39;s factoring algorithm and to the Abelian hidden subgroup problem in general. Finally we prove that quantum factoring cannot be realized as a normalizer circuit owing to its modular exponentiation subroutine.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present complete results of the experiment on measuring the Casimir force between an Au-coated sphere and an untreated or, alternatively, UV-treated indium tin oxide film deposited on a quartz substrate. Measurements were performed using an atomic force microscope in a high vacuum chamber. The measurement system was calibrated electrostatically. Special analysis of the systematic deviations is performed, and respective corrections in the calibration parameters are introduced. The corrected parameters are free from anomalies discussed in the literature. The experimental data for the Casimir force from two measurement sets for both untreated and UV-treated samples are presented. The experimental errors are determined at a 95% confidence level. It is demonstrated that the UV treatment of an I TO plate results in a significant decrease in the magnitude of the Casimir force (from 21% to 35% depending on separation). However, ellipsometry measurements of the imaginary parts of dielectric permittivities of the untreated and UV-treated samples did not reveal any significant differences. The experimental data are compared with computations in the framework of the Lifshitz theory. It is found that the data for the untreated sample are in a very good agreement with theoretical results taking into account the free charge carriers in an ITO film. For the UV-treated sample the data exclude the theoretical results obtained with account of free charge carriers. These data are in a very good agreement with computations disregarding the contribution of free carriers. According to the explanation provided, this is caused by the phase transition of the ITO film from metallic to dielectric state caused by the UV treatment. Possible applications of the discovered phenomenon in nanotechnology are discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
The study of hyperfine interactions in optically excited fullerenes has recently acquired importance within the context of nuclear spin entanglement for quantum information technology. We here report a first-principles pseudopotential study of the hyperfine coupling parameters of optically excited fullerene derivatives as well as small organic radicals. The calculations are performed within the gauge-invariant projector-augmented wave method [C. Pickard and F. Mauri, Phys. Rev. B. 63, 245101 (2001)]. In order to establish the accuracy of this methodology we compare our results with all-electron calculations and with experiment. In the case of fullerene derivatives we study the hyperfine coupling in the spin-triplet exciton state and compare our calculations with recent electron paramagnetic resonance measurements [M. Schaffry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 200501 (2010)]. We discuss our results in light of a recent proposal for entangling remote nuclear spins in photo-excited chromophores.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study dissipative transport of spontaneously emitting atoms in a 1D standing-wave laser field in the regimes where the underlying deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics is regular and chaotic. A Monte Carlo stochastic wavefunction method is applied to simulate semiclassically the atomic dynamics with coupled internal and translational degrees of freedom. It is shown in numerical experiments and confirmed analytically that chaotic atomic transport can take the form either of ballistic motion or a random walking with specific statistical properties. The character of spatial and momentum diffusion in the ballistic atomic transport is shown to change abruptly in the atom-laser detuning regime where the Hamiltonian dynamics is irregular in the sense of dynamical chaos. We find a clear correlation between the behavior of the momentum diffusion coefficient and Hamiltonian chaos probability which is a manifestation of chaoticity of the fundamental atom-light interaction in the diffusive-like dissipative atomic transport. We propose to measure a linear extent of atomic clouds in a 1D optical lattice and predict that, beginning with those values of the mean cloud&#39;s momentum for which the probability of Hamiltonian chaos is close to 1, the linear extent of the corresponding clouds should increase sharply. A sensitive dependence of statistical characteristics of dissipative transport on the values of the detuning allows to manipulate the atomic transport by changing the laser frequency.

<blockquote>
<p>
A common limitation of experiments using color centers in diamond is the poor photon collection efficiency of microscope objectives due to refraction at the diamond interface. We present a simple and effective technique to detect a large fraction of photons emitted by color centers within a planar diamond sample by detecting light that is guided to the edges of the diamond via total internal reflection. We describe a prototype device using this &quot;side-collection&quot; technique, which provides a photon collection efficiency of approximately 47% and a photon detection efficiency of approximately 39%. We apply the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio gained from side-collection to AC magnetometry using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers, and demonstrate an AC magnetic field sensitivity of 100 pT/\sqrt{Hz}, limited by added noise in the prototype side-collection device. Technical optimization should allow significant further improvements in photon collection and detection efficiency as well as sub-picotesla NV-diamond magnetic field sensitivity using the side-collection technique.

<p>
The time-dependent numerical renormalization-group approach (TD-NRG), originally devised for tracking the real-time dynamics of quantum-impurity systems following a single quantum quench, is extended to multiple switching events. This generalization of the TD-NRG encompasses the possibility of periodic switching, allowing for coherent control of strongly correlated systems by an external time-dependent field. To this end, we have embedded the TD-NRG in a hybrid framework that combines the outstanding capabilities of the numerical renormalization group to systematically construct the effective low-energy Hamiltonian of the system with the prowess of complementary approaches for calculating the real-time dynamics derived from this Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the power of our approach by hybridizing the TD-NRG with the Chebyshev expansion technique in order to investigate periodic switching in the interacting resonant-level model. Although the interacting model shares the same low-energy fixed point as its noninteracting counterpart, we surprisingly find the gradual emergence of damped oscillations as the interaction strength is increased. Focusing on a single quantum quench and using a strong-coupling analysis, we reveal the origin of these interaction-induced oscillations and provide an analytical estimate for their frequency. The latter agrees well with the numerical results.

<p><strong>25.    Planar Superconducting Resonators with Internal Quality Factors above One Million</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We describe the fabrication and measurement of microwave coplanar waveguide resonators with internal quality factors above 10 million at high microwave powers and over 1 million at low powers, with the best low power results approaching 2 million, corresponding to ~1 photon in the resonator. These quality factors are achieved by controllably producing very smooth and clean interfaces between the resonators&#39; aluminum metallization and the underlying single crystal sapphire substrate. Additionally, we describe a method for analyzing the resonator microwave response, with which we can directly determine the internal quality factor and frequency of a resonator embedded in an imperfect measurement circuit.

<p><strong>26.    Atom-photon interactions in a system of coupled cavities</strong><br>
Abdelkrim El Amili, Sébastien Gleyzes, Christoph I Westbrook<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3534">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3534</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a theoretical treatment of single atom detection in an compound, optical micro cavity. The cavity consists of a single mode semiconductor waveguide with a gap to allow atoms to interact with the optical field in the cavity. Optical losses, both in the semiconductor and induced by the gap are considered and we give an estimate of the cavity finesse. We also compute the cooperativity parameter and show how it depends on the gap width and cavity length. Maximization of the cooperativity does not always correspond to maximization of the coupling.

<p><strong>27.    Non-equilibrium dynamics of the Tavis-Cummings model</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4416">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4416</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum many-body theory no generic microscopic principle at the origin of complex dynamics is known. Quite opposed, in classical mechanics the theory of non-linear dynamics provides a detailed framework for the distinction between near-integrable and chaotic systems. Here we propose to describe the off-equilibrium dynamics of the Tavis-Cummings model by an underlying classical Hamiltonian system, which can be analyzed using the powerful tools of classical theory of motion. We show that scattering in the classical phase space can drive the quantum model close to thermal equilibrium. Interestingly, this happens in the fully quantum regime, where physical observables do not show any dynamic chaotic behavior.

<p><strong>28.    Dynamical Localization for d-Dimensional Random Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Alain Joye<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4759">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4759</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a d-dimensional random quantum walk with site-dependent random coin operators. The corresponding transition coefficients are characterized by deterministic amplitudes times independent identically distributed site-dependent random phases. When the deterministic transition amplitudes are close enough to those of a quantum walk which forbids propagation, we prove that dynamical localization holds for almost all random phases. This instance of Anderson localization implies that all quantum mechanical moments of the position operator are uniformly bounded in time and that spectral localization holds, almost surely.

<p><strong>29.    Spacetime rotation-induced Landau quantization</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. D 85, 061502(R) (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5188">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5188</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate non-inertial and gravitational effects on quantum states in electromagnetic fields and present the analytic solution for energy eigenstates for the Schr\&quot;odinger equation including non-inertial, gravitational and electromagnetic effects. We find that in addition to the Landau quantization the rotation of spacetime itself leads to the additional quantization, and that the energy levels for an electron are different from those for a proton at the level of gravitational corrections.

<p><strong>30.    Quantum current noise from a Born-Markov master equation</strong><br>
P. G. Kirton, A. D. Armour, M. Houzet, F. Pistolesi<br>
PRB, 86, 081305(R), 2012<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6238">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6238</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a formalism for calculating the non-symmetrized quantum current noise within the Born-Markov approximation for the master equation. The formalism is particularly well suited to obtaining the current noise for quantum transport in mesoscopic devices such as a superconducting single electron transistor (SSET). As an example of the method, we obtain explicit results for the double Josephson-quasiparticle (DJQP) resonance in a SSET. Our calculations reveal the asymmetries that develop in the current noise as well as clarifying the behavior at high frequencies. Our findings are consistent with recent measurements of the asymmetry in the current noise spectrum.
