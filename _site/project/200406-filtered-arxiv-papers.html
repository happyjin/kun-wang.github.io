    <p><strong>1.    Scattering, trapped modes and guided waves in waveguides and diffraction gratings</strong><br>
Valery E. Grikurov<br>
1st East-West Workshop on Adv. Tech. in Electromagnetics, Warsaw, May 20-21, 2004<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406019">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406019</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest the numerical approach to detect eigenfrequencies of trapped modes in waveguides or guided waves in diffraction gratings. At the same time, the approach works perfectly for computation of systems with finitely many scattering channels. The most attractive example concerns the possibility of control on electron transport in nano-dimensions system consisting of a resonator and finitely many adjoined channels due to external variable electric field.

<p><strong>2.    Stroboscopic quantum walks</strong><br>
O. Buerschaper, K. Burnett<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406039">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406039</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete time (coined) quantum walks are produced by the repeated application of a constant unitary transformation to a quantum system. By recasting these walks into the setting of periodic perturbations to an otherwise freely evolving system we introduce the concept of a stroboscopic quantum walk. Through numerical simulation, we establish the link between families of stroboscopic walks and quantum resonances. These are observed in the nonlinear systems of quantum chaos theory such as the delta-kicked rotator or the delta-kicked accelerator.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum Dynamics of a Particle with a Spin-dependent Velocity</strong><br>
Claude Aslangul<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406057">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406057</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of a particle in continuous time and space, the displacement of which is governed by an internal degree of freedom (spin). In one definite limit, the so-called quantum random walk is recovered but, although quite simple, the model possesses a rich variety of dynamics and goes far beyond this problem. Generally speaking, our framework can describe the motion of an electron in a magnetic sea near the Fermi level when linearisation of the dispersion law is possible, coupled to a transverse magnetic field. Quite unexpected behaviours are obtained. In particular, we find that when the initial wave packet is fully localized in space, the $J_{z}$ angular momentum component is frozen; this is an interesting example of an observable which, although it is not a constant of motion, has a constant expectation value. For a non-completely localized wave packet, the effect still occurs although less pronounced, and the spin keeps for ever memory of its initial state. Generally speaking, as time goes on, the spatial density profile looks rather complex, as a consequence of the competition between drift and precession, and displays various shapes according to the ratio between the Larmor period and the characteristic time of flight. The density profile gradually changes from a multimodal quickly moving distribution when the scatttering rate is small, to a unimodal standing but flattening distribution in the opposite cas case.

<p><strong>4.    Probabilities of failure for quantum error correction</strong><br>
A. J. Scott<br>
Quantum Inf. Process. 4, 399 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406063">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406063</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the performance of a quantum error-correcting code when pushed beyond its intended capacity to protect information against errors, presenting formulae for the probability of failure when the errors affect more qudits than that specified by the code&#39;s minimum distance. Such formulae provide a means to rank different codes of the same minimum distance. We consider both error detection and error correction, treating explicit examples in the case of stabilizer codes constructed from qubits and encoding a single qubit.

<p><strong>5.    Aperiodic Quantum Random Walks</strong><br>
Pedro Ribeiro, Perola Milman, Remy Mosseri<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406071">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406071</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We generalize the quantum random walk protocol for a particle in a one-dimensional chain, by using several types of biased quantum coins, arranged in aperiodic sequences, in a manner that leads to a rich variety of possible wave function evolutions. Quasiperiodic sequences, following the Fibonacci prescription, are of particular interest, leading to a sub-ballistic wavefunction spreading. In contrast, random sequences leads to diffusive spreading, similar to the classical random walk behaviour. We also describe how to experimentally implement these aperiodic sequences.

<p><strong>6.    Convergence of coined quantum walks on d-dimensional Euclidean space</strong><br>
Alex D. Gottlieb, Svante Janson, Petra F. Scudo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406072">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406072</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Coined quantum walks may be interpreted as the motion in position space of a quantum particle with a spin degree of freedom; the dynamics are determined by iterating a unitary transformation which is the product of a spin transformation and a translation conditional on the spin state. Coined quantum walks on the d-dimensional lattice can be treated as special cases of coined quantum walks on d-dimensional Euclidean space. We study quantum walks on d-dimensional Euclidean space and prove that the sequence of rescaled probability distributions in position space associated to the unitary evolution of the particle converges to a limit distribution.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum computation in optical lattices via global laser addressing</strong><br>
Alastair Kay, Jiannis K. Pachos<br>
New J. Phys. 6 126 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406073">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406073</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme for globally addressing a quantum computer is presented along with its realisation in an optical lattice setup of one, two or three dimensions. The required resources are mainly those necessary for performing quantum simulations of spin systems with optical lattices, circumventing the necessity for single qubit addressing. We present the control procedures, in terms of laser manipulations, required to realise universal quantum computation. Error avoidance with the help of the quantum Zeno effect is presented and a scheme for globally addressed error correction is given. The latter does not require measurements during the computation, facilitating its experimental implementation. As an illustrative example, the pulse sequence for the factorisation of the number fifteen is given.

<p><strong>8.    Fault tolerant quantum key distribution protocol with collective random unitary noise</strong><br>
X.B. Wang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406100">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406100</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an easy implementable prepare-and-measure protocol for robust quantum key distribution with photon polarization. The protocol is fault tolerant against collective random unitary channel noise. The protocol does not need any collective quantum measurement or quantum memory. A security proof and a specific linear optical realization using spontaneous parametric down conversion are given.

<p><strong>9.    On Quantum Cellular Automata</strong><br>
Alexander Yu. Vlasov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406119">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406119</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In recent work [quant-ph/0405174] by Schumacher and Werner was discussed an abstract algebraic approach to a model of reversible quantum cellular automata (CA) on a lattice. It was used special model of CA based on partitioning scheme and so there is a question about quantum CA derived from more general, standard model of classical CA. In present work is considered an approach to definition of a scheme with &quot;history&quot;, valid for quantization both irreversible and reversible classical CA directly using local transition rules. It is used language of vectors in Hilbert spaces instead of C*-algebras, but results may be compared in some cases. Finally, the quantum lattice gases, quantum walk and &quot;bots&quot; are also discussed briefly.

<p><strong>10.    Permanents in linear optical networks</strong><br>
Stefan Scheel<br>
results are contained in Acta Physica Slovaca 58, 675 (2008) and in Chap.28 of Beth/Leuchs (eds.) &#39;Quantum Information Processing&#39; (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406127">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406127</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop an abstract look at linear optical networks from the viewpoint of combinatorics and permanents. In particular we show that calculation of matrix elements of unitarily transformed photonic multi-mode states is intimately linked to the computation of permanents. An implication of this remarkable fact is that all calculations that are based on evaluating matrix elements are generically computationally hard. Moreover, quantum mechanics provides simpler derivations of certain matrix analysis results which we exemplify by showing that the permanent of any unitary matrix takes its values across the unit disk in the complex plane.

<p><strong>12.    Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Daniel Gottesman<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 052328 (2004) (14 pages)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a &quot;canonical form&quot; that requires at most O(n^2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.

<p><strong>13.    Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation via Exchange interactions</strong><br>
M. Mohseni, D.A. Lidar<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 040507 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406198">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406198</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computation can be performed by encoding logical qubits into the states of two or more physical qubits, and controlling a single effective exchange interaction and possibly a global magnetic field. This &quot;encoded universality&quot; paradigm offers potential simplifications in quantum computer design since it does away with the need to perform single-qubit rotations. Here we show that encoded universality schemes can be combined with quantum error correction. In particular, we show explicitly how to perform fault-tolerant leakage correction, thus overcoming the main obstacle to fault-tolerant encoded universality.

<p><strong>15.    Canonical and kinetic forms of the electromagnetic momentum in an ad hoc quantization scheme for a dispersive dielectric</strong><br>
J. C. Garrison, R. Y. Chiao<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406222">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406222</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An ad hoc quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in a weakly dispersive, transparent dielectric leads to the definition of canonical and kinetic forms for the momentum of the electromagnetic field in a dispersive medium. The canonical momentum is uniquely defined as the operator that generates spatial translations in a uniform medium, but the quantization scheme suggests two possible choices for the kinetic momentum operator, corresponding to the Abraham or the Minkowski momentum in classical electrodynamics. Another implication of this procedure is that a wave packet containing a single dressed photon travels at the group velocity through the medium. The physical significance of the canonical momentum has already been established by considerations of energy and momentum conservation in the atomic recoil due to spontaneous emission, the Cerenkov effect, the Doppler effect, and phase matching in nonlinear optical processes. In addition, the data of the Jones and Leslie radiation pressure experiment is consistent with the assignment of one ?k unit of canonical momentum to each dressed photon. By contrast, experiments in which the dielectric is rigidly accelerated by unbalanced electromagnetic forces require the use of the Abraham momentum.

<p><strong>17.    Quantum Process Tomography of the Quantum Fourier Transform</strong><br>
Yaakov S. Weinstein, Timothy F. Havel, Joseph Emerson, Nicolas Boulant, Marcos Saraceno, Seth Lloyd, David G. Cory<br>
J. Chem. Phys. 121(13), 6117-6133 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406239">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406239</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The results of quantum process tomography on a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor are presented, and shown to be consistent with a detailed model of the system-plus-apparatus used for the experiments. The quantum operation studied was the quantum Fourier transform, which is important in several quantum algorithms and poses a rigorous test for the precision of our recently-developed strongly modulating control fields. The results were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into coherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and decoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a superoperator consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with the theoretically expected unitary superoperator of the quantum Fourier transform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual portion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is required for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer simulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a consequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography procedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and decoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the spectrum of the overall superoperator. The gate fidelity of the experimentally determined superoperator was 0.64, while the correlation coefficient between experimentally determined superoperator and the simulated superoperator was 0.79; most of the discrepancies with the simulations could be explained by the cummulative effect of small errors in the single qubit gates.
