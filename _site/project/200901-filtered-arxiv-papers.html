<blockquote>
<p>
In this letter, we report a realization of synchronization-free quantum teleportation and narrowband three-photon entanglement through interfering narrowband photon sources. Since both the single-photon and the entangled photon pair utilized are completely autonomous, it removes the requirement of high demanding synchronization technique in long-distance quantum communication with pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources. The frequency linewidth of the three-photon entanglement realized is on the order of several MHz, which matches the requirement of atomic ensemble based quantum memories. Such a narrowband multi-photon source will have applications in some advanced quantum communication protocols and linear optical quantum computation.

<p>
We study a Fabry-Perot cavity formed from a ridge waveguide on a AlGaAs substrate. We experimentally determined the propagation losses in the waveguide at 780 nm, the wavelength of Rb atoms. We have also made a numerical and analytical estimate of the losses induced by the presence of the gap which would allow the interaction of cold atoms with the cavity field. We found that the intrinsic finesse of the gapped cavity can be on the order of F ~ 30, which, when one takes into account the losses due to mirror transmission, corresponds to a cooperativity parameter for our system C ~ 1.

<p>
We propose and experimentally investigate a fibre-based quantum key distribution system, which employs polarization qubits encoded into faint laser pulses. As a novel feature, it allows sending of classical framing information via sequences of strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data. This allows synchronization, sender and receiver identification, and compensation of time-varying birefringence in the communication channel. In addition, this method also provides a platform to communicate implementation specific information such as encoding and protocol in view of future optical quantum networks. Furthermore, we report on our current effort to develop high-rate error correction.

<blockquote>
<p>
The evolution of a many-particle system on a one-dimensional lattice, subjected to a quantum walk can cause spatial entanglement in the lattice position, which can be exploited for quantum information/communication purposes. We demonstrate the evolution of spatial entanglement and its dependence on the quantum coin operation parameters, the number of particles present in the lattice and the number of steps of quantum walk on the system. Thus, spatial entanglement can be controlled and optimized using a many-particle discrete-time quantum walk.

<p><strong>5.    Pure single photon generation by type-I PDC with backward-wave amplification</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0873">http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0873</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore a promising method of generating pure heralded single photons. Our approach is based on parametric downconversion in a periodically-poled waveguide. However, unlike conventional downconversion sources, the photon pairs are counter-propagating: one travels with the pump beam in the forward direction while the other is backpropagating towards the laser source. Our calculations reveal that these downconverted two-photon states carry minimal spectral correlations within each photon-pair. This approach offers the possibility to employ a new range of downconversion processes and materials like PPLN (previously considered unsuitable due to their unfavorable phasematching properties) to herald pure single photons over a broad frequency range.

<p><strong>6.    Faster transport with a directed quantum walk</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1007">http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1007</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give the first example of faster transport with a quantum walk on an inherently directed graph, on the directed line with a variable number of self-loops at each vertex. These self-loops can be thought of as adding a number of small dimensions. This is a discrete time quantum walk using the Fourier transform coin, where the walk proceeds a distance $\Theta(1)$ in constant time compared to $\Theta(1/n)$ classically, independent of the number of these small dimensions. The analysis proceeds by reducing this walk to a walk with a two dimensional coin.

<p><strong>7.    Asymptotic entanglement in a two-dimensional quantum walk</strong><br>
Mostafa Annabestani, Mohammad Reza Abolhasani, Gonzalo Abal<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1188">http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1188</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The evolution operator of a discrete-time quantum walk involves a conditional shift in position space which entangles the coin and position degrees of freedom of the walker. After several steps, the coin-position entanglement (CPE) converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. In this work we provide an analytical method which allows for the exact calculation of the asymptotic reduced density operator and the corresponding CPE for a discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator as an entanglement measure. The method is applied to the case of a Hadamard walk for which the dependence of the resulting CPE on initial conditions is obtained. Initial states leading to maximum or minimum CPE are identified and the relation between the coin or position entanglement present in the initial state of the walker and the final level of CPE is discussed. The CPE obtained from separable initial states satisfies an additivity property in terms of CPE of the corresponding one-dimensional cases. Non-local initial conditions are also considered and we find that the extreme case of an initial uniform position distribution leads to the largest CPE variation.

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the non-Markovian dynamics of a quantum system subject to spontaneous collapse in space. After having proved, under suitable conditions, the separation of the center-of-mass and relative motions, we focus our analysis on the time evolution of the center of mass of an isolated system (free particle case). We compute the explicit expression of the Green&#39;s function, for a generic Gaussian noise, and analyze in detail the case of an exponential correlation function. We study the time evolution of average quantities, such as the mean position, momentum and energy. We eventually specialize to the case of Gaussian wave functions, and prove that all basic facts about collapse models, which are known to be true in the white noise case, hold also in the more general case of non-Markovian dynamics.

Some fundamental and formal aspects of the quantum dwell time are reviewed, examples for free motion and scattering off a potential barrier are provided, as well as extensions of the concept. We also examine the connection between the dwell time of a quantum particle in a region of space and flux-flux correlations at the boundaries, as well as operational approaches and approximations to measure the flux-flux correlation function and thus the second moment of the dwell time, which is shown to be characteristically quantum, and larger than the corresponding classical moment even for freely moving particles.

We construct explicitly two infinite families of genuine nonadditive 1-error correcting quantum codes and prove that their coding subspaces are 50% larger than those of the optimal stabilizer codes of the same parameters via the linear programming bound. All these nonadditive codes can be characterized by a stabilizer-like structure and thus their encoding circuits can be designed in a straightforward manner.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum random walks (QRW) on the integers, a subject that has been considered in the last few years in the framework of quantum computation. We show how the theory of CMV matrices gives a natural tool to study these processes and to give results that are analogous to those that Karlin and McGregor developed to study (classical) birth-and-death processes using orthogonal polynomials on the real line. In perfect analogy with the classical case the study of QRWs on the set of non-negative integers can be handled using scalar valued (Laurent) polynomials and a scalar valued measure on the circle. In the case of classical or quantum random walks on the integers one needs to allow for matrix valued versions of these notions. We show how our tools yield results in the well known case of the Hadamard walk, but we go beyond this translation invariant model to analyze examples that are hard to analyze using other methods. More precisely we consider QRWs on the set of non- negative integers. The analysis of these cases leads to phenomena that are absent in the case of QRWs on the integers even if one restricts oneself to a constant coin. This is illustrated here by studying recurrence properties of the walk, but the same method can be used for other purposes. The presentation here aims at being selfcontained, but we re- frain from trying to give an introduction to quantum random walks, a subject well surveyed in the literature we quote. For two excellent reviews, see [1, 18]. See also the recent notes [19].

<p><strong>12.    The Algebraic Measure of a Hidden Markov Quantum Memory Channel</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
This paper was presented in poster form at and in the proceedings of the QCMC 2008. It is a summary of a fuller paper to appear separately. The classical product state capacity of a noisy quantum channel with memory is investigated. A forgetful noise-memory channel is constructed by Markov switching between two depolarizing channels which introduces non-Markovian noise correlations between successive channel uses. This function of a Markov process can be reformulated as an algebraic measure. This framework provides an expression for the asymptotic entropy rate and thus enables the calculation of the classical capacity. The effects of the hidden-Markovian memory on the capacity are explored. An increase in noise-correlations is found to increase the capacity.

The quantum properties of the pairs are measured using a two-photon coalescence experiment showing a visibility of 85%.

The output fields of a pair of coherently coupled nonlinear optical cavities are found to exhibit strong optical entanglement.

<p><strong>15.    An Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Nonlinear Optics</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
This article is provides an introduction to the quantum theory of optics in nonlinear dielectric media. We begin with a short summary of the classical theory of nonlinear optics, that is nonlinear optics done with classical fields. We then discuss the canonical formalism for fields and its quantization. This is applied to quantizing the electromagnetic field in free space. The definition of a nonclassical state of the electromagnetic field is presented, and several examples are examined. This is followed by a brief introduction to entanglement in the context of field modes. The next task is the quantization of the electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous, linear dielectric medium. Before going on to field quantization in nonlinear media, we discuss a number of commonly employed phenomenological models for quantum nonlinear optical processes. We then quantize the field in both nondispersive and dispersive nonlinear media. Flaws in the most commonly used methods of accomplishing this task are pointed out and discussed. Once the quantization has been completed, it is used to study a multimode theory of parametric down conversion and the propagation of quantum solitons.

<p><strong>16.    Information flow at the quantum-classical boundary</strong><br>
Cédric Bény<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3629">http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3629</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the nature of the information preserved by a quantum channel via the observables which exist in its image (in the Heisenberg picture), and can therefore be simulated on the receiver&#39;s side. The sharp observables preserved by a channel form an operator algebra which can be characterized in terms of the channel&#39;s elements. The effect of the channel on these observables can be reversed by another physical transformation. These results generalize the theory of quantum error correction to codes characterized by arbitrary von Neumann algebras, which can represent hybrid quantum-classical information, continuous variable systems, or certain quantum field theories. The preserved unsharp observables (positive operator-valued measures) allow for a finer characterization of the information preserved by a channel. We show that the only type of information which can be duplicated arbitrarily many times consists of coarse-grainings of a single POVM. Based on these results, we propose a model of decoherence which can account for the emergence of a classical phase-space. This model supports the view that the quantum-classical correspondence is given by a quantum-to-classical channel, i.e. a POVM.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks can be used either as tools for quantum algorithm development or as entanglement generators, potentially useful to test quantum hardware. We present a novel algorithm based on a discrete Hadamard quantum walk on a line with one coin and two walkers whose purpose is to generate entanglement between walkers. We provide several classical computer simulations of our quantum algorithm in which we show that, although the asymptotical amount of entanglement generated between walkers does not reach the highest degree of entanglement possible at each step for either coin measurement outcome, the entanglement ratio (entanglement generated/highest value of entanglement possible, for each step) tends to converge, and the actual convergence value depends on the coin initial state and on the coin measurement outcome. Furthermore, our numerical simulations show that, for the quantum walks used in our algorithm, the value towards which entanglement ratio converges also depends on the position probability distribution symmetry of a quantum walk computed with one single walker and the same coin initial state employed in the corresponding quantum walk with two walkers.

We show that certain types of quantum walks can be modeled as waves that propagate in a medium with phase and group velocities that are explicitly calculable. Since the group and phase velocities indicate how fast wave packets can propagate causally, we propose the use of these wave velocities in a new definition for the hitting time of quantum walks. The new definition of hitting time has the advantage that it requires neither the specification of a walker&#39;s initial condition nor of an arrival probability threshold. We give full details for the case of quantum walks on the Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. This includes the special cases of quantum walks on the line and on hypercubes.

We study the adiabatic quantum dynamics of an anisotropic spin-1 XY chain across a second order quantum phase transition. The system is driven out of equilibrium by performing a quench on the uniaxial single-spin anisotropy, that is supposed to vary linearly in time. We show that, for sufficiently large system sizes, the excess energy after the quench admits a non trivial scaling behavior that is not predictable by standard Kibble-Zurek arguments for isolated critical points or extended critical regions. This emerges from a competing effect of many accessible low-lying excited states, inside the whole continuous line of critical points.

We study the charge conductivity in one-dimensional prototype models of interacting particles, such as the Hubbard and the t-V spinless fermion model, when coupled to some external baths injecting and extracting particles at the boundaries. We show that, if these systems are driven far from equilibrium, a negative differential conductivity regime can arise. The above electronic models can be mapped into Heisenberg-like spin ladders coupled to two magnetic baths, so that charge transport mechanisms are explained in terms of quantum spin transport. The negative differential conductivity is due to oppositely polarized ferromagnetic domains which arise at the edges of the chain, and therefore inhibit spin transport: we propose a qualitative understanding of the phenomenon by analyzing the localization of one-magnon excitations created at the borders of a ferromagnetic region. We also show that negative differential conductivity is stable against breaking of integrability. Numerical simulations of non-equilibrium time evolution have been performed by employing a Monte-Carlo wave function approach and a matrix product operator formalism.

The $(3 + 1)$-dimensional (generalized) Dirac equation is shown to have the same form as the equation expressing the condition that a given point lies on a given line in 3-dimensional projective space. The resulting Hamiltonian with a $\gamma_5$ mass term is not Hermitian, but is invariant under the combined transformation of parity reflection $\cal P$ and time reversal $\cal T$. When the $\cal PT$ symmetry is unbroken, the energy spectrum of the free spin-$\frac {1}{2}$ theory is real, with an appropriately shifted mass.

We propose a quantization of linear, volume preserving, maps on the discrete and finite 3-torus T_N^3 represented by elements of the group SL(3,Z_N). These flows can be considered as special motions of the Nambu dynamics (linear Nambu flows) in the three dimensional toroidal phase space and are characterized by invariant vectors, a, of T_N^3. We quantize all such flows which are necessarily restricted on a planar two-dimensional phase space, embedded in the 3-torus, transverse to the vector a . The corresponding maps belong to the little group of the vector a in SL(3,Z_N) which is an SL(2,Z_N) subgroup. The associated linear Nambu maps are generated by a pair of linear and quadratic Hamiltonians (Clebsch-Monge potentials of the flow) and the corresponding quantum maps, realize the metaplectic representation of SL(3,Z_N) on the discrete group of three dimensional magnetic translations i.e. the non-commutative 3-torus with deformation parameter the N-th root of unity. Other potential applications of our construction are related to the quantization of deterministic chaos in turbulent maps as well as to quantum tomography of three dimensional objects.

<p>
The maximally-decoupled method has been considered as a theory to apply an basic idea of an integrability condition to certain multiple parametrized symmetries. The method is regarded as a mathematical tool to describe a symmetry of a collective submanifold in which a canonicity condition makes the collective variables to be an orthogonal coordinate-system. For this aim we adopt a concept of curvature unfamiliar in the conventional time-dependent (TD) self-consistent field (SCF) theory. Our basic idea lies in the introduction of a sort of Lagrange manner familiar to fluid dynamics to describe a collective coordinate-system. This manner enables us to take a one-form which is linearly composed of a TD SCF Hamiltonian and infinitesimal generators induced by collective variable differentials of a canonical transformation on a group. The integrability condition of the system read the curvature C=0. Our method is constructed manifesting itself the structure of the group under consideration. &gt;...
