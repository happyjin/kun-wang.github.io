    <p><strong>1.    Two-qubit entanglement dynamics for two different non-Markovian environments</strong><br>
Bruno Bellomo, Rosario Lo Franco, Sabrina Maniscalco, Giuseppe Compagno<br>
Phys. Scr. T 140 (2010) 014014<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0050">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0050</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the time behavior of entanglement between two noninteracting qubits each immersed in its own environment for two different non-Markovian conditions: a high-$Q$ cavity slightly off-resonant with the qubit transition frequency and a nonperfect photonic band-gap, respectively. We find that revivals and retardation of entanglement loss may occur by adjusting the cavity-qubit detuning, in the first case, while partial entanglement trapping occurs in non-ideal photonic-band gap.

<p><strong>2.    Producing high fidelity single photons with optimal brightness via waveguided parametric down-conversion</strong><br>

Optics Express Vol. 17, Iss. 25, pp. 22823-22837 (2009)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Parametric down-conversion (PDC) offers the possibility to control the fabrication of non-Gaussian states such as Fock states. However, in conventional PDC sources energy and momentum conservation introduce strict frequency and photon number correlations, which impact the fidelity of the prepared state. In our work we optimize the preparation of single-photon Fock states from the emission of waveguided PDC via spectral filtering. We study the effect of correlations via photon number resolving detection and quantum interference. Our measurements show how the reduction of mixedness due to filtering can be evaluated. Interfering the prepared photon with a coherent state we establish an experimentally measured fidelity of the produced target state of 78%.

<p><strong>3.    Exact solution of Markovian master equations for quadratic fermi systems: thermal baths, open XY spin chains, and non-equilibrium phase transition</strong><br>
Tomaz Prosen, Bojan Zunkovic<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0195">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0195</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We generalize the method of third quantization to a unified exact treatment of Redfield and Lindblad master equations for open quadratic systems of n fermions in terms of diagonalization of 4n x 4n matrix. Non-equilibrium thermal driving in terms of the Redfield equation is analyzed in detail. We explain how to compute all physically relevant quantities, such as non-equilibrium expectation values of local observables, various entropies or information measures, or time evolution and properties of relaxation. We also discuss how to exactly treat explicitly time dependent problems. The general formalism is then applied to study a thermally driven open XY spin 1/2 chain. We find that recently proposed non-equilibrium quantum phase transition in the open XY chain survives the thermal driving within the Redfield model. In particular, the phase of long-range magnetic correlations can be characterized by hypersensitivity of the non-equilibrium-steady state to external (bath or bulk) parameters. Studying the heat transport we find negative thermal conductance for sufficiently strong thermal driving, as well as non-monotonic dependence of the heat current on the strength of the bath coupling.

<p><strong>4.    Random tensor theory: extending random matrix theory to random product states</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Aram W. Harrow, Matthew B. Hastings<br>
Commun. Math. Phys., vol. 310, no. 1, pp. 25-74 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0472">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0472</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a problem in random matrix theory that is inspired by quantum information theory: determining the largest eigenvalue of a sum of p random product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and p/d^k are fixed while d grows. When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law determines (up to small corrections) not only the largest eigenvalue ((1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2) but the smallest eigenvalue (min(0,1-sqrt{p/d^k})^2) and the spectral density in between. We use the method of moments to show that for k&gt;1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately (1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result to the random tensor case. Our bound on the largest eigenvalue has implications both for sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution and for a recently proposed quantum data-hiding and correlation-locking scheme due to Leung and Winter. Since the matrices we consider have neither independent entries nor unitary invariance, we need to develop new techniques for their analysis. The main contribution of this paper is to give three different methods for analyzing mixtures of random product states: a diagrammatic approach based on Gaussian integrals, a combinatorial method that looks at the cycle decompositions of permutations and a recursive method that uses a variant of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.

<p><strong>5.    Grover Energy Transfer at Relativistic Speeds</strong><br>
Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin Pedro Chamorro-Posada<br>
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 455301 (2010)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0964">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0964</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover&#39;s algorithm for quantum search can also be applied to classical energy transfer. The procedure takes a system in which the total energy is equally distributed among $N$ subsystems and transfers most of the it to one marked subsystem. We show that in a relativistic setting the efficiency of this procedure can be improved. We will consider the transfer of relativistic kinetic energy in a series of elastic collisions. In this case, the number of steps of the energy transfer procedure approaches 1 as the initial velocities of the objects become closer to the speed of light. This is a consequence of introducing non-linearities in the procedure. However, the maximum attainable transfer will depend on the particular combination of speed and number of objects. In the procedure, we will use $N$ elements, like in the classical case, instead of the $log_2(N)$ states of the quantum algorithm.

<p>
A proof that continuous time quantum walks are universal for quantum computation, using unweighted graphs of low degree, has recently been presented by Childs [PRL 102 180501 (2009)]. We present a version based instead on the discrete time quantum walk. We show the discrete time quantum walk is able to implement the same universal gate set and thus both discrete and continuous time quantum walks are computational primitives. Additionally we give a set of components on which the discrete time quantum walk provides perfect state transfer.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study thermalization in many-body quantum systems locally coupled to an external bath. It is shown that quantum chaotic systems do thermalize, that is, they exhibit relaxation to an invariant ergodic state which, in the bulk, is well approximated by the grand canonical state. Moreover, the resulting ergodic state in the bulk does not depend on the details of the baths. On the other hand, for integrable systems the invariant state does depend on the bath and is different from the grand canonical state.

<p><strong>10.    Linear atomic quantum coupler</strong><br>
Faisal A. A. El-Orany, Wahiddin M. R. B<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1665">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1665</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we develop the notion of the linear atomic quantum coupler. This device consists of two modes propagating into two waveguides, each of them includes a localized and/or a trapped atom. These waveguides are placed close enough to allow exchanging energy between them via evanescent waves. Each mode interacts with the atom in the same waveguide in the standard way, i.e. as the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and with the atom-mode in the second waveguide via evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for the system and deduce the exact form for the wavefunction. We investigate the atomic inversions and the second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional linear coupler, the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects. The atomic inversions can exhibit long revival-collapse phenomenon as well as subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in the system. Finally, under certain conditions, the system can yield the results of the two-mode JCM.

<p><strong>11.    Design and optimisation of quantum logic circuits for a three-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm implemented with optically-controlled, solid-state quantum logic gates</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyse the design and optimisation of quantum logic circuits suitable for the experimental demonstration of a three-qubit quantum computation prototype based on optically-controlled, solid-state quantum logic gates. In these gates, the interaction between two qubits carried by the electron-spin of donors is mediated by the optical excitation of a control particle placed in their proximity. First, we use a geometrical approach for analysing the entangling characteristics of these quantum gates. Then, using a genetic programming algorithm, we develop circuits for the refined Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm investigating different strategies for obtaining short total computational times. We test two separate approaches based on using different sets of entangling gates with the shortest possible gate computation time which, however, does not introduce leakage of quantum information to the control particles. The first set exploits fast approximations of controlled-phase gates as entangling gates, while the other one arbitrary entangling gates with a shorter gate computation time compared to the first set. We have identified circuits with consistently shorter total computation times when using controlled-phase gates.

<p><strong>12.    Limits of quantum speedup in photosynthetic light harvesting</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1847">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1847</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It has been suggested that excitation transport in photosynthetic light harvesting complexes features speedups analogous to those found in quantum algorithms. Here we compare the dynamics in these light harvesting systems to the dynamics of quantum walks, in order to elucidate the limits of such quantum speedups. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex of green sulfur bacteria, we show that while there is indeed speedup at short times, this is short lived (70 fs) despite longer lived (ps) quantum coherence. Remarkably, this time scale is independent of the details of the decoherence model. More generally, we show that the distinguishing features of light-harvesting complexes not only limit the extent of quantum speedup but also reduce rates of diffusive transport. These results suggest that quantum coherent effects in biological systems are optimized for efficiency or robustness rather than the more elusive goal of quantum speedup.

As an example of the coin-position decoherence, we study the broken line quantum walk and compare our results with the numerical one. We also show that our analytical results reduce to the Brun formalism when only the coin is subjected to decoherence.

<p>
We present the first robust implementation of a coined quantum walk over five steps using only passive optical elements. By employing a fiber network loop we keep the amount of required resources constant as the walker&#39;s position Hilbert space is increased. We observed a non-Gaussian distribution of the walker&#39;s final position, thus characterizing a faster spread of the photon wave-packet in comparison to the classical random walk. The walk is realized for many different coin settings and initial states, which opens the way for the implementation of a quantum walk-based search algorithm.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2292">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2292</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate frequency up-conversion of low power cw resonant radiation in Rb vapour as a function of various experimental parameters. We present evidence that the process of four wave mixing is responsible for unidirectional blue light generation and that the phase matching conditions along a light-induced waveguide determine the direction and divergence of the blue light. Velocity-selective excitation to the 5D level via step-wise and two-photon processes results in a Doppler-free dependence on the frequency detuning of the applied laser fields from the respective dipole-allowed transitions. Possible schemes for ultraviolet generation are discussed.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2457">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2457</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum memory is a key element for quantum repeaters and linear optical quantum computers. In addition to memory, repeaters and computers also require manipulating quantum states by means of unitary transformations, which is generally accomplished using interferometric optical setups. We experimentally investigate photon-echo type atom-light interaction for the possibility to combine storage with controlled transformation of quantum states. As an example, we demonstrate unambiguous state discrimination of qubits and qutrits in an Ti:Er:LiNbO$_3$ waveguide cooled to 3K using states encoded into large ensembles of identically prepared photons in superposition of different temporal modes. The high robustness and flexibility of our approach makes it promising for quantum communication and computation as well as precision measurements.

<p>
The one dimensional quantum walk of anyonic systems is presented. The anyonic walker performs braiding operations with stationary anyons of the same type ordered canonically on the line of the walk. Abelian as well as non-Abelian anyons are studied and it is shown that they have very different properties. Abelian anyonic walks demonstrate the expected quadratic quantum speedup. Non-Abelian anyonic walks are much more subtle. The exponential increase of the system&#39;s Hilbert space and the particular statistical evolution of non-Abelian anyons give a variety of new behaviors. The position distribution of the walker is related to Jones polynomials, topological invariants of the links created by the anyonic world-lines during the walk. Several examples such as the SU(2) level k and the quantum double models are considered that provide insight to the rich diffusion properties of anyons.

<p>
If a one-dimensional quantum lattice system is subject to one step of a reversible discrete-time dynamics, it is intuitive that as much &quot;quantum information&quot; as moves into any given block of cells from the left, has to exit that block to the right. For two types of such systems - namely quantum walks and cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a quantity that measures the &quot;net flow of quantum information&quot; through the system. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the discrete dynamics. First, two systems S_1, S_2 can be pieced together, in the sense that there is a system S which locally acts like S_1 in one region and like S_2 in some other region, if and only if S_1 and S_2 have the same index. Second, the index labels connected components of such systems: equality of the index is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a continuous deformation of S_1 into S_2. In the case of quantum walks, the index is integer-valued, whereas for cellular automata, it takes values in the group of positive rationals. In both cases, the map S -&gt; ind S is a group homomorphism if composition of the discrete dynamics is taken as the group law of the quantum systems. Systems with trivial index are precisely those which can be realized by partitioned unitaries, and the prototypes of systems with non-trivial index are shifts.

In the context of quantum information theory, &quot;quantization&quot; of various mathematical and computational constructions is said to occur upon the replacement, at various points in the construction, of the classical randomization notion of probability distribution with higher order randomization notions from quantum mechanics such as quantum superposition with measurement. For this to be done &quot;properly&quot;, a faithful copy of the original construction is required to exist within the new &quot;quantum&quot; one, just as is required when a function is extended to a larger domain.

We present general methods for simulating black-box Hamiltonians using quantum walks. These techniques have two main applications: simulating sparse Hamiltonians and implementing black-box unitary operations. In particular, we give the best known simulation of sparse Hamiltonians with constant precision. Our method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number of nonzero elements in a column) and the evolution time t, whereas previous methods had complexity scaling as D^4 and were superlinear in t. We also consider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a black-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for performing an explicitly specified N x N unitary operation use O(N^2) elementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with bounded error using O(N^{2/3} (log log N)^{4/3}) queries to its matrix elements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most unitaries can be performed with only O(sqrt{N}) queries, which is optimal.

<p>
The relationship between BQP and PH has been an open problem since the earliest days of quantum computing. We present evidence that quantum computers can solve problems outside the entire polynomial hierarchy, by relating this question to topics in circuit complexity, pseudorandomness, and Fourier analysis. First, we show that there exists an oracle relation problem (i.e., a problem with many valid outputs) that is solvable in BQP, but not in PH. This also yields a non-oracle relation problem that is solvable in quantum logarithmic time, but not in AC0. Second, we show that an oracle decision problem separating BQP from PH would follow from the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture, which we formulate here and which is likely of independent interest. The original Linial-Nisan Conjecture (about pseudorandomness against constant-depth circuits) was recently proved by Braverman, after being open for twenty years.

<p>
The weak convergence theorems of the one- and two-dimensional simple quantum walks, SQW$^{(d)}, d=1,2$, show a striking contrast to the classical counterparts, the simple random walks, SRW$^{(d)}$. The limit distributions have novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports of them are bounded. In the present paper we claim that these properties of the SQW$^{(d)}$ can be explained by the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that the Dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a quantum walk model in three dimensions, where the walker has a four-component qubit. We clarify that the pseudovelocity $\V(t)$ of the quantum walker, which solves the Dirac equation, is identified with the relativistic velocity. Since the quantum walker should be a tardyon, not a tachyon, $|\V(t)| &lt; c$, where $c$ is the speed of light, and this restriction (the causality) is the origin of the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in quantum walk models. By reducing the number of components of momentum in the Dirac equation, we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the lower dimensional quantum walks. We show that the obtained limit distributions for the one- and two-dimensional systems have the common features with those of SQW$^{(1)}$ and SQW$^{(2)}$.

<p><strong>25.    Multimode Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in the Lossy Medium</strong><br>
Radoslaw Chrapkiewicz, Wojciech Wasilewski<br>
Journal of Modern Optics, Volume 57, Issue 5, 2010<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the process of multimode Spontaneous Parametric Down--Conversion (SPDC) in the lossy, one dimensional waveguide. We propose a description using first order Correlation Functions (CF) in the fluorescence fields, as a very fruitful and easy approach providing us with a complete information about the final multimode state. We formulate the equation of the evolution of the multimode CF along the crystal using four characteristic length scales. We solve it analytically in the one mode case and numerically in the multimode case. We capture simultaneous effects of three wave mixing with ultrashort pump, linear propagation and attenuation, and we are able to divide the evolution into three stages and predict it qualitatively. We find that losses do not destroy the quantum properties of SPDC but stabilize the final state.

<p><strong>26.    Optimal Decoherence Control in non-Markovian Open, Dissipative Quantum Systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the optimal control problem for non-Markovian open, dissipative quantum system. Optimal control using Pontryagin maximum principle is specifically derived. The influences of Ohmic reservoir with Lorentz-Drude regularization are numerically studied in a two-level system under the following three conditions: \omega_0\ll\omega_c, \omega_0\approx\omega_c or \omega_0\gg\omega_c, where \omega_0 is the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest, and \omega_c the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. The optimal control process shows its remarkable influences on the decoherence dynamics. The temperature is a key factor in the decoherence dynamics. We analyze the optimal decoherence control in high temperature, intermediate temperature, and low temperature reservoirs respectively. It implies that designing some engineered reservoirs with the controlled coupling and state of the environment can slow down the decoherence rate and delay the decoherence time. Moreover, we compare the non-Markovian optimal decoherence control with the Markovian one and find that with non-Markovian the engineered artificial reservoirs are better than with the Markovian approximation in controlling the open, dissipative quantum system&#39;s decoherence.

<p><strong>27.    Control by quantum dynamics on graphs</strong><br>
Chris Godsil, Simone Severini<br>
Phys. Rev. A 81, 052316 (2010)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5397">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5397</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the study of controllability of a closed quantum system whose dynamical Lie algebra is generated by adjacency matrices of graphs. We characterize a large family of graphs that renders a system controllable. The key property is a novel graph-theoretic feature consisting of a particularly disordered cycle structure. Disregarding efficiency of control functions, but choosing subfamilies of sparse graphs, the results translate into continuous-time quantum walks for universal computation.

<p><strong>28.    Non-Markovian entanglement dynamics between two coupled qubits in the same environment</strong><br>
Wei Cui, Zairong Xi, Yu Pan<br>
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42 (2009) 155303<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5793">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5793</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the dynamics of the entanglement in two independent non-Markovian channels. In particular, we focus on the entanglement dynamics as a function of the initial states and the channel parameters like the temperature and the ratio $r$ between $\omega_0$ the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. We give a stationary analysis of the concurrence and find that the dynamic of non-markovian entanglement concurrence $\mathcal{C}<em>{\rho}(t)$ at temperature $k_BT=0$ is different from the $k_BT&gt;0$ case. We find that &quot;entanglement sudden death&quot; (ESD) depends on the initial state when $k_BT=0$, otherwise the concurrence always disappear at finite time when $k_BT&gt;0$, which means that ESD must happen. The main result of this paper is that the non-Markovian entanglement dynamic is fundamentally different from the Markovian one. In the Markovian channel, entanglement decays exponentially and vanishes only asymptotically, but in the non-Markovian channel the concurrence $\mathcal{C}</em>{\rho}(t)$ oscillates, especially in the high temperature case. Then an open-loop controller adjusted by the temperature is proposed to control the entanglement and prolong the ESD time.

<p><strong>29.    The effect of large-decoherence on mixing-time in Continuous-time quantum walks on long-range interacting cycles</strong><br>
S. Salimi, R. Radgohar<br>
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 (2010) 025503.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5795">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5795</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks on long-range interacting cycles (LRICs), which are the extensions of the cycle graphs. For this purpose, we use Gurvitz&#39;s model and assume that every node is monitored by the corresponding point contact induced the decoherence process. Then, we focus on large rates of decoherence and calculate the probability distribution analytically and obtain the lower and upper bounds of the mixing time. Our results prove that the mixing time is proportional to the rate of decoherence and the inverse of the distance parameter ($\emph{m}$) squared. This shows that the mixing time decreases with increasing the range of interaction. Also, what we obtain for $\emph{m}=0$ is in agreement with Fedichkin, Solenov and Tamon&#39;s results \cite{FST} for cycle, and see that the mixing time of CTQWs on cycle improves with adding interacting edges.

<p><strong>30.    Strange Attractors in Dissipative Nambu Mechanics : Classical and Quantum Aspects</strong><br>
Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos<br>
JHEP 1004:036,2010<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3881">http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3881</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We extend the framework of Nambu-Hamiltonian Mechanics to include dissipation in $R^{3}$ phase space. We demonstrate that it accommodates the phase space dynamics of low dimensional dissipative systems such as the much studied Lorenz and R\&quot;{o}ssler Strange attractors, as well as the more recent constructions of Chen and Leipnik-Newton. The rotational, volume preserving part of the flow preserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so called {\em Nambu Hamiltonians}. They foliate the entire phase space and are, in turn, deformed in time by Dissipation which represents their irrotational part of the flow. It is given by the gradient of a scalar function and is responsible for the emergence of the Strange Attractors. Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics, we provide an explicit quantization of the Lorenz attractor through the introduction of Non-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \times N $ matrices in $ R^{3}$. They satisfy the commutation relations induced by one of the two Nambu Hamiltonians, the second one generating a unique time evolution. Dissipation is incorporated quantum mechanically in a self-consistent way having the correct classical limit without the introduction of external degrees of freedom. Due to its volume phase space contraction it violates the quantum commutation relations. We demonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution equations for the Quantum Lorenz system give rise to an attracting ellipsoid in the $3 N^{2}$ dimensional phase space.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a flux qubit in a coplanar waveguide resonator by measuring transmission through the system. In our system with the flux qubit decoupled galvanically from the resonator, the intermediate coupling regime is achieved. In this regime dispersive readout is possible with weak backaction on the qubit. The detailed theoretical analysis and simulations give a good agreement with the experimental data and allow to make the qubit characterization.
