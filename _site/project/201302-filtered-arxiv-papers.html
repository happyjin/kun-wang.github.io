<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a large grid of individually addressable superconducting single photon detectors on a single chip. Each detector element is fully integrated into an independent waveguide circuit with custom functionality at telecom wavelengths. High device density is achieved by fabricating the nanowire detectors in traveling wave geometry directly on top of silicon-on-insulator waveguides. Our superconducting single-photon detector matrix includes detector designs optimized for high detection efficiency, low dark count rate and high timing accuracy. As an example, we exploit the high timing resolution of a particularly short nanowire design to resolve individual photon round-trips in a cavity ring-down measurement of a silicon ring resonator.

<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum algorithm is exact if it always produces the correct answer, on any input. Coming up with exact quantum algorithms that substantially outperform the best classical algorithm has been a quite challenging task. In this paper, we present two new exact quantum algorithms for natural problems: 1) for the problem EXACT_k^n in which we have to determine whether the sequence of input bits x_1, ..., x_n contains exactly k values x_i=1; 2) for the problem THRESHOLD_k^n in which we have to determine if at least k of n input bits are equal to 1.

<p><strong>3.    A broad-band laser-driven double Fano system - photoelectron spectra</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fano profiles, with their asymmetric character, have many potential applications in technology. The design of Fano profiles into optical systems may create new nonlinear and switchable metamaterials, high-quality optical waveguides, ultrasensitive media for chemical or biosensing etc. In this paper, we consider an external field-driven double Fano model, in which, instead of one autoionizing state, there are two discrete states embedded in one continuum. We assume further that the external electromagnetic field can be decomposed into two parts: a deterministic (or coherent) part and a randomly fluctuating chaotic component, which is a \delta-correlated, Gaussian, Markov and stationary process (white noise). This assumption corresponds to the case of the real multimode laser operating without any correlation between the modes. We solve a set of coupled stochastic integro-differential equations involving the Fano model with two discrete levels. We derive an exact formula by determining the photoelectron spectrum and compare it with the results obtained in our previous papers.

We present the full characterization of phase-randomized or phase-averaged coherent states, a class of states exploited in communication channels and in decoy state-based quantum key distribution protocols. In particular, we report on the suitable formalism to analytically describe the main features of this class of states and on their experimental investigation, that results in agreement with theory. We also show the results we obtained by manipulating the phase-averaged coherent states with linear optical elements and testify their good quality by employing some non-Gaussianity measures and the concept of mutual information.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2055">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2055</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the conditions under which the trace distance between two different states of a given open system increases in time due to the interaction with an environment, therefore signalling non-Markovianity. We find that the finite-time difference in trace distance is bounded by two sharply defined quantities that are strictly linked to the occurrence of system-environment correlations created throughout their interaction and affecting the subsequent evolution of the system. This allows to shed light on the origin of non-Markovian behaviours in quantum dynamics. We best illustrate our findings by tackling two physically relevant examples: a non-Markovian dephasing mechanism that has been the focus of a recent experimental endeavour and the open-system dynamics experienced by a spin connected to a finite-size quantum spin chain.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study one-dimensional quantum walks in a homogeneous electric field. The field is given by a phase which depends linearly on position and is applied after each step. The long time propagation properties of this system, such as revivals, ballistic expansion and Anderson localization, depend very sensitively on the value of the electric field $\Phi$, e.g., on whether $\Phi/(2\pi)$ is rational or irrational. We relate these properties to the continued fraction expansion of the field. When the field is given only with finite accuracy, the beginning of the expansion allows analogous conclusions about the behavior on finite time scales.

<p>
We report on the experimental realization of electric quantum walks, which mimic the effect of an electric field on a charged particle in a lattice. Starting from a textbook implementation of discrete-time quantum walks, we introduce an extra operation in each step to implement the effect of the field. The recorded dynamics of such a quantum particle exhibits features closely related to Bloch oscillations and interband tunneling. In particular, we explore the regime of strong fields, demonstrating contrasting quantum behaviors: quantum resonances vs. dynamical localization depending on whether the accumulated Bloch phase is a rational or irrational fraction of 2\pi.

<p><strong>8.    Two-photon interference of weak coherent laser pulses recalled from separate solid-state quantum memories</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum memories for light, which allow the reversible transfer of quantum states between light and matter, are central to the development of quantum repeaters, quantum networks, and linear optics quantum computing. Significant progress has been reported in recent years, including the faithful transfer of quantum information from photons in pure and entangled qubit states. However, none of these demonstrations confirm that photons stored in and recalled from quantum memories remain suitable for two-photon interference measurements, such as C-NOT gates and Bell-state measurements, which constitute another key ingredient for all aforementioned applications of quantum information processing. Using pairs of weak laser pulses, each containing less than one photon on average, we demonstrate two-photon interference as well as a Bell-state measurement after either none, one, or both pulses have been reversibly mapped to separate thulium-doped titanium-indiffused lithium niobate (Ti:Tm:LiNbO3) waveguides. As the interference is always near the theoretical maximum, we conclude that our solid-state quantum memories, in addition to faithfully mapping quantum information, also preserves the entire photonic wavefunction. Hence, we demonstrate that our memories are generally suitable for use in advanced applications of quantum information processing that require two-photon interference.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce and study the properties of an array of QED cavities coupled by nonlinear elements, in the presence of photon leakage and driven by a coherent source. The nonlinear couplings lead to photon hopping and to nearest-neighbor Kerr terms. By tuning the system parameters, the steady state of the array can exhibit a photon crystal associated with a periodic modulation of the photon blockade. In some cases, the crystalline ordering may coexist with phase synchronization. The class of cavity arrays we consider can be built with superconducting circuits of existing technology.

<p><strong>10.    Provable Advantage for Quantum Strategies in Random Symmetric XOR Games</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Jānis Iraids<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2347">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2347</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-local games are widely studied as a model to investigate the properties of quantum mechanics as opposed to classical mechanics. In this paper, we consider a subset of non-local games: symmetric XOR games of $n$ players with 0-1 valued questions. For this class of games, each player receives an input bit and responds with an output bit without communicating to the other players. The winning condition only depends on XOR of output bits and is constant w.r.t. permutation of players. We prove that for almost any $n$-player symmetric XOR game the entangled value of the game is $\Theta (\frac{\sqrt{\ln{n}}}{n^{1/4}})$ adapting an old result by Salem and Zygmund on the asymptotics of random trigonometric polynomials. Consequently, we show that the classical-quantum gap is $\Theta (\sqrt{\ln{n}})$ for almost any symmetric XOR game.

<p><strong>11.    Dispersion forces inside metallic waveguides</strong><br>

Physical Review A 87, 062105 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2464">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2464</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the dispersion energy of a pair of dipoles embedded in a metallic waveguide with transverse dimension $a$ smaller than the characteristic dipolar wavelength. We find that $a$ sets the scale that separates retarded, Casimir-Polder-like, from quasistatic, van der Waals-like, interactions. Whereas in the retarded regime, the energy decays exponentially with inter-dipolar distance, typical of evanescent waves, in the van der Waals regime, the known free-space result is obtained. This short-range scaling implies that the additivity of the dispersion interactions inside a waveguide extends to denser media, along with modifications to related Casimir effects in such structures.

<p><strong>12.    An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the surface code</strong><br>
Adrian Hutter, James R. Wootton, Daniel Loss<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2669">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2669</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) has been been the primary classical algorithm for error correction in the surface code, since it is of low runtime complexity and achieves relatively low logical error rates [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 180501 (2012)]. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 160503 (2012)] is able to achieve lower logical error rates and higher thresholds than MWPM, but requires a classical runtime complexity which is super-polynomial in L, the linear size of the code. In this work we present an MCMC algorithm that achieves significantly lower logical error rates than MWPM at the cost of a polynomially increased classical runtime complexity. For error rates p close to the threshold, our algorithm needs a runtime complexity which is increased by O(L^2) relative to MWPM in order to achieve a lower logical error rate. If p is below an L-dependent critical value, no increase in the runtime complexity is necessary any longer. For p-&gt;0, the logical error rate achieved by our algorithm is exponentially smaller (in L) than that of MWPM, without requiring an increased runtime complexity. Our algorithm allows for trade-offs between runtime and achieved logical error rates as well as for parallelization, and can be also used to correct in the case of imperfect stabilizer measurements.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose quantum receivers with optical squeezing and photon-number-resolving detector (PNRD) for the near-optimal discrimination of quaternary phase-shift-keyed coherent state signals. The basic scheme is similar to the previous proposals (e.g. Phys. Rev. A 84, 042328 (2012)) in which displacement operations, on-off detectors, and electrical feedforward operations were used. Here we study two types of receivers where one installs optical squeezings and the other uses PNRDs instead of on-off detectors. We show that both receivers can attain lower error rates than that by the previous scheme and in particular, the PNRD based receiver has a significant gain under the fixed number of feedfoward steps. Moreover, we show that the PNRD based receiver can suppress the errors due to dark counts, which is not possible by the on-off detector based receiver with a limited number of feedforwards.

<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that a quantum walk can detect the presence of a marked element in a graph in $O(\sqrt{WR})$ steps for any initial probability distribution on vertices. Here, $W$ is the total weight of the graph, and $R$ is the effective resistance. This generalizes the result by Szegedy that is only applicable if the initial distribution is stationary. We describe a time-efficient quantum algorithm for 3-distinctness based on these ideas.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3247">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3247</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum code is a subspace of a Hilbert space of a physical system chosen to be correctable against a given class of errors, where information can be encoded. Ideally, the quantum code lies within the ground space of the physical system. When the physical model is the Heisenberg ferromagnet in the absence of an external magnetic field, the corresponding ground-space contains all permutation-invariant states. We use techniques from combinatorics and operator theory to construct families of permutation-invariant quantum codes. These codes have length proportional to $t^2$; one family of codes perfectly corrects arbitrary weight $t$ errors, while the other family of codes approximately correct $t$ spontaneous decay errors. The analysis of our codes&#39; performance with respect to spontaneous decay errors utilizes elementary matrix analysis, where we revisit and extend the quantum error correction criterion of Knill and Laflamme, and Leung, Chuang, Nielsen and Yamamoto.

Active quantum error correction using qubit stabilizer codes has emerged as a promising, but experimentally challenging, engineering program for building a universal quantum computer. In this review we consider the formalism of qubit stabilizer and subsystem stabilizer codes and their possible use in protecting quantum information in a quantum memory. We review the theory of fault-tolerance and quantum error-correction, discuss examples of various codes and code constructions, the general quantum error correction conditions, the noise threshold, the special role played by Clifford gates and the route towards fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. The second part of the review is focused on providing an overview of quantum error correction using two-dimensional (topological) codes, in particular the surface code architecture. We discuss the complexity of decoding and the notion of passive or self-correcting quantum memories. The review does not focus on a particular technology but discusses topics that will be relevant for various quantum technologies.

<blockquote>
<p>
We have studied dynamical properties and quantum tunneling in asymmetric double-well (DW) systems, by solving Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation with the use of two kinds of spectral methods for initially squeezed Gaussian wavepackets. Time dependences of wavefunction, averages of position and momentum, the auto-correlation function, an uncertainty product and the tunneling probability have been calculated. Our calculations have shown that (i) the tunneling probability is considerably reduced by a potential asymmetry $\Delta U$, (ii) a resonant tunneling with $|\Delta U| \simeq \kappa :\hbar \omega$ is realized for motion starting from upper minimum of asymmetric potential wells, but not for motion from lower minimum, ($\kappa=0,1,2,...$; $\omega$: oscillator frequency at minima), (iii) the reduction of the tunneling probability by an asymmetry is less significant for the Gaussian wavepacket with narrower width, and (iv) the uncertainty product $&lt;\delta x^2&gt; &lt;\delta p^2&gt;$ in the resonant tunneling state is larger than that in the non-resonant tunneling state. The item (ii) is in contrast with the earlier study [Mugnai {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 38} (1987) 2182] which showed the symmetric result for motion starting from upper and lower minima.

We show that two-qubit non-Markovianity coincides with instances of non-divisibility of the corresponding dynamical map, and we discuss the pair of states maximizing information flowback. We also discuss the issue of additivity for the measure we use and in doing so, give an indication of its usefulness as a resource for multipartite quantum systems.

<p>
The large deviation theory has recently been applied to open quantum systems to uncover dynamical crossovers in the space of quantum trajectories associated to Markovian evolutions. Such dynamical crossovers are characterized by qualitative changes in the fluctuations of rare quantum jump trajectories, and have been observed in the statistics of coherently driven quantum systems. In this article we investigate the counting statistics of rare quantum trajectories of an undriven system undergoing a pure relaxation process, namely, Markovian exciton transport. We find that dynamical crossovers occur in systems with a minimum of three interacting molecules, and are strongly activated by exciton delocalization and interference. Our results illustrate how quantum features of the underlying system Hamiltonian can influence the statistical properties of energy transfer processes in a non-trivial manner.

<blockquote>
<p>
Known quantum error correction schemes are typically able to take advantage of only a limited class of classical error-correcting codes. Entanglement-assisted quantum error correction is a partial solution which made it possible to exploit any classical linear codes over the binary or quaternary finite field. However, the known entanglement-assisted scheme requires noiseless qubits that help correct quantum errors on noisy qubits, which can be too severe an assumption. We prove that a more relaxed and realistic assumption is sufficient by presenting encoding and decoding operations assisted by qubits on which quantum errors of one particular kind may occur. As in entanglement assistance, our scheme can import any binary or quaternary linear codes. If the auxiliarly qubits are noiseless, our codes become entanglement-assisted codes, and saturate the quantum Singleton bound when the underlying classical codes are maximum distance separable.

We investigate the performance of a streamlined version of Shor&#39;s algorithm in which the quantum Fourier transform is replaced by a banded version that for each qubit retains only coupling to its $b$ nearest neighbors. Defining the performance $P(n,b)$ of the $n$-qubit algorithm for bandwidth $b$ as the ratio of the success rates of Shor&#39;s algorithm equipped with the banded and the full bandwidth ($b=n-1$) versions of the quantum Fourier transform, our numerical simulations show that $P(n,b) \approx \exp[-\varphi_{max}^2 (n,b)/100]$ for $n &lt; n_t(b)$ (non-exponential regime) and $P(n,b) \approx 2^{-\xi_b (n-8)}$ for $n&gt;n_t(b)$ (exponential regime), where $n_{t}(b)$, the location of the transition, is approximately given by $n_{t}(b)\approx b+5.9 + \sqrt{7.7(b+2)-47}$ for $b\gtrsim 8$, $\varphi_{max} (n,b) = 2\pi[2^{-b-1} (n-b-2) + 2^{-n}]$, and $\xi_b\approx 1.1 \times 2^{-2b}$. Analytically we obtain $P(n,b) \approx \exp[-\varphi_{max}^2 (n,b)/64]$ for $n<n_t(b)$ and $P(n,b) \approx 2^{-\xi_b^{(a)} n}$ for $n>n_t(b)$, where $\xi_{b}^{(a)} \approx \frac{\pi^2}{12 \ln(2)} \times 2^{-2b} \approx 1.19 \times 2^{-2b}$. Thus, our analytical results predict the $\varphi_{max}^2$ scaling ($n<n_t$) and the $2^{-2b}$ scaling ($n>n_t$) of the data perfectly. In addition, in the large-$n$ regime, the prefactor in $\xi_b^{(a)}$ is close to the results of our numerical simulations and, in the low-$n$ regime, the numerical scaling factor in our analytical result is within a factor 2 of its numerical value. As an example we show that $b=8$ is sufficient for factoring RSA-2048 with a 95% success rate.

<p><strong>26.    Microwave control of atomic motional states in a spin-dependent optical lattice</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Spin-dependent optical potentials allow us to use microwave radiation to manipulate the motional state of trapped neutral atoms (F\&quot;orster et al. 2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 233001). Here, we discuss this method in greater detail, comparing it to the widely-employed Raman sideband coupling method. We provide a simplified model for sideband cooling in a spin-dependent potential, and we discuss it in terms of the generalized Lamb-Dicke parameter. Using a master equation formalism, we present a quantitative analysis of the cooling performance for our experiment, which can be generalized to other experimental settings. We additionally use microwave sideband transitions to engineer motional Fock states and coherent states, and we devise a technique for measuring the population distribution of the prepared states.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a new tool for the quantitative characterisation of the departure form Markovianity of a given dynamical process. Our tool can be applied to a generic $N$-level system and extended straightforwardly to Gaussian continuous-variable systems. It is linked to the change of the volume of physical states that are dynamically accessible to a system and provides qualitative expectations in agreement with some of the analogous tools proposed so far. We illustrate its prediticve power by tackling a few canonical examples.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report on quantum, classical, and total correlations in a set of distant quantum emitters coupled via their interaction with the plasmon modes of a one-dimensional waveguide driven by an external laser field. The coupling of the emitters with the plasmonic modes and its influence on the collective decay rate suggest that entanglement does not play a significant role in the qubit dynamics. Rather, discord is the quantity that matters and should be harnessed as a resource.

Furthermore, our algorithm has time complexity ~O(n^{5/7}), improving the previous ~O(n^{3/4}).

<p><strong>31.    Possible latitude effects of Chern-Simons gravity on quantum interference</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0002">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0002</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It has been recently suggested that possible effects of Chern-Simons gravity on a quantum interferometer are dependent on the latitude and direction of the interferometer on Earth in orbital motion around Sun. Continuing work initiated in the earlier publication [Okawara, Yamada and Asada, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 231101 (2012)], we perform numerical calculations of time variation in the induced phase shifts for nonequatorial cases. We show that the maximum phase shift at any latitude might occur at 6, 0 (and 12), and 18 hours (in local time) of each day, when the normal vector to the interferometer is vertical, eastbound and northbound, respectively. If two identical interferometers were located at different latitudes, the difference between two phase shifts that are measured at the same local time would be $O(\sin \delta\varphi)$ for a small latitude difference $\delta\varphi$. It might thus become maximally $\sim 20$ percents for $\delta\varphi \sim 10$ degrees, for instance.

We demonstrate niobium titanium nitride superconducting nanowires patterned on stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides for detecting visible and infrared photons. The use of silicon nitride on insulator on silicon substrates allows us to simultaneously realize photonic circuits for visible and infrared light and integrate them with nanowire detectors directly on-chip. By implementing a traveling wave detector geometry in this material platform, we achieve efficient single photon detection for both wavelength regimes. Our detectors are an ideal match for integrated quantum optics as they provide crucial functionality on a wideband transparent waveguide material.

<p>
We propose a model of network growth in which the network is co-evolving together with the dynamics of a quantum mechanical system, namely a quantum walk taking place over the network. The model naturally generalizes the Barab\&#39;{a}si-Albert model of preferential attachment and has a rich set of tunable parameters, such as the initial conditions of the dynamics or the interaction of the system with its environment. We show that the model produces networks with two-modal power-law degree distributions, super-hubs, finite clustering coefficient, small-world behaviour and non-trivial degree-degree correlations.

<p><strong>35.    Optical coupling to nanoscale optomechanical cavities for near quantum-limited motion transduction</strong><br>
Justin D. Cohen, Sean Meenehan, Oskar Painter<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1807">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1807</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A significant challenge in the development of chip-scale cavity-optomechanical devices as testbeds for quantum experiments and classical metrology lies in the coupling of light from nanoscale optical mode volumes to conventional optical components such as lenses and fibers. In this work we demonstrate a high-efficiency, single-sided fiber-optic coupling platform for optomechanical cavities. By utilizing an adiabatic waveguide taper to transform a single optical mode between a photonic crystal zipper cavity and a permanently mounted fiber, we achieve a collection efficiency for intracavity photons of 52% at the cavity resonance wavelength of 1538nm. An optical balanced homodyne measurement of the displacement fluctuations of the fundamental in-plane mechanical resonance at 3.3 MHz reveals that the imprecision noise floor lies a factor of 2.8 above the standard quantum limit (SQL) for continuous position measurement, with a predicted total added noise of 1.4 phonons at the optimal probe power. The combination of extremely low measurement noise and robust fiber alignment presents significant progress towards single-phonon sensitivity for these sorts of integrated micro-optomechanical cavities.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum computing is a promising approach of computation that is based on equations from Quantum Mechanics. A simulator for quantum algorithms must be capable of performing heavy mathematical matrix transforms. The design of the simulator itself takes one of three forms: Quantum Turing Machine, Network Model or circuit model of connected gates or, Quantum Programming Language, yet, some simulators are hybrid. We studied previous simulators and then we adopt features from three simulators of different implementation languages, different paradigms, and for different platforms. They are Quantum Computing Language (QCL), QUASI, and Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab 5. Our simulator for quantum algorithms takes the form of a package or a programming library for Quantum computing, with a case study showing the ability of using it in the circuit model. The .NET is a promising platform for computing. VB.NET is an easy, high productive programming language with the full power and functionality provided by the .NET framework. It is highly readable, writeable, and flexible language, compared to another language such as C#.NET in many aspects. We adopted VB.NET although its shortage in built-in mathematical complex and matrix operations, compared to Matlab. For implementation, we first built a mathematical core of matrix operations. Then, we built a quantum core which contains: basic qubits and register operations, basic 1D, 2D, and 3D quantum gates, and multi-view visualization of the quantum state, then a window for demos to show you how to use and get the most of the package.
