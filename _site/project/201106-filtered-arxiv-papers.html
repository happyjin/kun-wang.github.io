    <p><strong>1.    Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in quantum and classical systems</strong><br>
Bassano Vacchini, Andrea Smirne, Elsi-Mari Laine, Jyrki Piilo, Heinz-Peter Breuer<br>
New J. Phys. 13, 093004 (2011)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the conceptually different definitions used for the non-Markovianity of classical and quantum processes. The well-established definition for non-Markovianity of a classical stochastic process represents a condition on the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the n-point joint probability distributions. Since this definition cannot be transferred to the quantum regime, quantum non-Markovianity has recently been defined and quantified in terms of the underlying quantum dynamical map, using either its divisibility properties or the behavior of the trace distance between pairs of initial states. Here, we investigate and compare these definitions and their relations to the classical notion of non-Markovianity by employing a large class of non-Markovian processes, known as semi-Markov processes, which admit a natural extension to the quantum case. A number of specific physical examples is constructed which allow to study the basic features of the classical and the quantum definitions and to evaluate explicitly the measures for quantum non-Markovianity. Our results clearly demonstrate several fundamental distinctions between the classical and the quantum notion of non-Markovianity, as well as between the various quantum measures for non-Markovianity.

<p><strong>2.    Coupling of a Single Diamond Nanocrystal to a Whispering-Gallery Microcavity: Photon Transportation Benefitting from Rayleigh Scattering</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the Rayleigh scattering induced by a diamond nanocrystal in a whispering-gallery-microcavity--waveguide coupling system, and find that it plays a significant role in the photon transportation. On one hand, this study provides a new insight into future solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics toward strong coupling physics. On the other hand, benefitting from this Rayleigh scattering, novel photon transportation such as dipole induced transparency and strong photon antibunching can occur simultaneously. As potential applications, this system can function as high-efficiency photon turnstiles. In contrast to [B. Dayan \textit{et al.}, \textrm{Science} \textbf{319},1062 (2008)], the photon turnstiles proposed here are highly immune to nanocrystal&#39;s azimuthal position.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum Walk with Jumps</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze a special class of 1-D quantum walks (QWs) realized using optical multi-ports. We assume non-perfect multi-ports showing errors in the connectivity, i.e. with a small probability the multi- ports can connect not to their nearest neighbor but to another multi-port at a fixed distance - we call this a jump. We study two cases of QW with jumps where multiple displacements can emerge at one timestep. The first case assumes time-correlated jumps (static disorder). In the second case, we choose the positions of jumps randomly in time (dynamic disorder). The probability distributions of position of the QW walker in both instances differ significantly: dynamic disorder leads to a Gaussian-like distribution, while for static disorder we find two distinct behaviors depending on the parity of jump size. In the case of even-sized jumps, the distribution exhibits a three-peak profile around the position of the initial excitation, whereas the probability distribution in the odd case follows a Laplace-like discrete distribution modulated by additional (exponential) peaks for long times. Finally, our numerical results indicate that by an appropriate mapping an universal functional behavior of the variance of the long-time probability distribution can be revealed with respect to the scaled average of jump size.

<p><strong>4.    Non-Markovian decay and dynamics of decoherence in private and public environments</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2457">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2457</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the decay process in an open system, emphasizing on the relevance of the environment&#39;s spectral structure. Non-Markovian effects are included to quantitatively analyze the degradation rate of the coherent evolution. The way in which a two level system is coupled to different environments is specifically addressed: multiple connections to a single bath (public environment)or single connections to multiple baths (private environments). We numerically evaluate the decay rate of a local excitation by using the Survival Probability and the Loschmidt Echo. These rates are compared to analytical results obtained from the standard Fermi Golden Rule (FGR) in Wide Band Approximation, and a Self-Consistent evaluation that accounts for the bath&#39;s memory in cases where an exact analytical solution is possible. We observe that the correlations appearing in a public bath introduce further deviations from the FGR as compared with a private bath.

<p><strong>5.    Many-Body Physics with Trapped Ions</strong><br>
Christian Schneider, Diego Porras, Tobias Schaetz<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2597">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2597</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Direct experimental access to some of the most intriguing quantum phenomena is not granted due to the lack of precise control of the relevant parameters in their naturally intricate environment. Their simulation on conventional computers is impossible, since quantum behaviour arising with superposition states or entanglement is not efficiently translatable into the classical language. However, one could gain deeper insight into complex quantum dynamics by experimentally simulating the quantum behaviour of interest in another quantum system, where the relevant parameters and interactions can be controlled and robust effects detected sufficiently well. We report on the progress in experimentally simulating quantum many-body physics with trapped ions.

<p><strong>6.    Non-Markovianity assisted Steady State Entanglement</strong><br>
Susana F. Huelga, ?ngel Rivas, Martin B. Plenio<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 160402 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2841">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2841</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the steady state entanglement generated in a coherently coupled dimer system subject to dephasing noise as a function of the degree of Markovianity of the evolution. By keeping fixed the effective noise strength while varying the memory time of the environment, we demonstrate that non-Markovianity is an essential, quantifiable resource that may support the formation of steady state entanglement whereas purely Markovian dynamics governed by Lindblad master equations lead to separable steady states. This result illustrates possible mechanisms leading to long-lived entanglement in purely decohering, possibly local, environments. We present a feasible experimental demonstration of this noise assisted phenomenon using a system of trapped ions.

<p><strong>7.    Entanglement or separability: The choice of how to factorize the algebra of a density matrix</strong><br>
Walter Thirring, Reinhold A. Bertlmann, Philipp K?hler, Heide Narnhofer<br>
Eur. Phys. J. D64, 181 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3047">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3047</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the concept of how entanglement changes with respect to different factorizations of the total algebra which describes the quantum states. Depending on the considered factorization a quantum state appears either entangled or separable. For pure states we always can switch unitarily between separability and entanglement, however, for mixed states a minimal amount of mixedness is needed. We discuss our general statements in detail for the familiar case of qubits, the GHZ states, Werner states and Gisin states, emphasizing their geometric features. As theorists we use and play with this free choice of factorization, which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist. For theorists it offers an extension of the interpretations and is adequate to generalizations, as we point out in the examples of quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping.

<p><strong>8.    Continuous variable quantum computation with spatial degrees of freedom of photons</strong><br>
D. S. Tasca, R. M. Gomes, F. Toscano, P. H. Souto Ribeiro, S. P. Walborn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 83, 052325 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3049">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3049</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the use of the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of photons propagating in the paraxial approximation for continuous variable information processing. Given the wide variety of linear optical devices available, a diverse range of operations can be performed on the spatial degrees of freedom of single photons. Here we show how to implement a set of continuous quantum logic gates which allow for universal quantum computation. In contrast with the usual quadratures of the electromagnetic field, the entire set of single photon gates for spatial degrees of freedom does not require optical nonlinearity and, in principle, can be performed with a single device: the spatial light modulator. Nevertheless, nonlinear optical processes, such as four-wave mixing, are needed in the implementation of two-photon gates. The efficiency of these gates is at present very low, however small scale investigations of continuous variable quantum computation are within the reach of current technology. In this regard, we show how novel cluster states for one-way quantum computing can be produced using spontaneous parametric down conversion.

<p><strong>9.    Connecting two jumplike unravelings for non-Markovian open quantum systems</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3173">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3173</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The development and use of Monte Carlo algorithms plays a visible role in the study of non-Markovian quantum dynamics due to the provided insight and powerful numerical methods for solving the system dynamics. In the Markovian case, the connections between the various types of methods are fairly well-understood while for non-Markovian case there has so far been only a few studies. We focus here on two jumplike unravelings of non-Markovian dynamics, the non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) method and the property state method by Gambetta, Askerud, and Wiseman (GAW). The results for simple quantum optical systems illustrate the connections between the realizations of the two methods and also highlight how the probability currents between the system and environment, or between the property states of the total system, associate to the decay rates of time-local master equations, and consequently to the jump rates of the NMQJ method.

We report the generation of correlated photon pairs in the telecom C-band, at room temperature, from a dispersion-engineered silicon photonic crystal waveguide.

With a coincidence to accidental ratio of 12.8, at a pair generation rate of 0.006 per pulse, this ultra-compact photon pair source is immediately applicable towards scalable quantum information processing realized on-chip.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4254">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4254</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In previous work, we have developed a dynamic learning paradigm for &quot;programming&quot; a general quantum computer. A learning algorithm is used to find a set of parameters for a coupled qubit system such that the system at an initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement results in the desired calculation value. This can be thought of as a quantum neural network (QNN). Here, we apply our method to a system of three qubits, and demonstrate training the quantum computer to estimate both pairwise and three-way entanglement.

From the set of operators for errors and its correction code, we introduce the so-called complete unitary transformation.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5210">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5210</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
When the environmental disturbace to a quantum system has a wavelength much larger than the system size, all qubits localized within a small area are under action of the same error operators. Noiseless subsystem and decoherence free subspace are known to correct such collective errors. We construct simple quantum circuits, which implement these collective error correction codes, for a small number $n$ of physical qubits. A single logical qubit is encoded with $n=3$ and $n=4$, while two logical qubits are encoded with $n=5$. The recursive relations among the subspaces employed in noiseless subsystem and decoherence free subspace play essential r^oles in our implementation. The recursive relations also show that the number of gates required to encode $m$ logical qubits increases linearly in $m$.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5447">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5447</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We put forward a framework to study the dynamics of a chain of interacting quantum particles affected by individual or collective multi-mode environment, focussing on the role played by the environmental quantum correlations over the evolution of the chain. The presence of entanglement in the state of the environmental system magnifies the non-Markovian nature of the chain&#39;s dynamics, giving rise to structures in figures of merit such as entanglement and purity that are not observed under a separable multi-mode environment. Our analysis can be relevant to problems tackling the open-system dynamics of biological complexes of strong current interest.

<blockquote>
<p>
Future communication and computation technologies that exploit quantum information require robust and well-isolated qubits. Electron spins in III-V semiconductor quantum dots, while promising candidates, see their dynamics limited by undesirable hysteresis and decohering effects of the nuclear spin bath. Replacing electrons with holes should suppress the hyperfine interaction and consequently eliminate strong nuclear effects. Using picosecond optical pulses, we demonstrate coherent control of a single hole qubit and examine both free-induction and spin-echo decay. In moving from electrons to holes, we observe significantly reduced hyperfine interactions, evidenced by the reemergence of hysteresis-free dynamics, while obtaining similar coherence times, limited by non-nuclear mechanisms. These results demonstrate the potential of optically controlled, quantum dot hole qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk represents one of the most promising resources for the simulation of physical quantum systems, and has also emerged as an alternative to the standard circuit model for quantum computing. Up to now the experimental implementations have been restricted to single particle quantum walk, while very recently the quantum walks of two identical photons have been reported. Here, for the first time, we investigate how the particle statistics, either bosonic or fermionic, influences a two-particle discrete quantum walk. Such experiment has been realized by adopting two-photon entangled states and integrated photonic circuits. The polarization entanglement was exploited to simulate the bunching-antibunching feature of non interacting bosons and fermions. To this scope a novel three-dimensional geometry for the waveguide circuit is introduced, which allows accurate polarization independent behaviour, maintaining a remarkable control on both phase and balancement.

<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated optical devices are expected to play a promising role in the field of quantum information science and technology. In this paper, we propose a scheme for the generation of nondegenerate, copolarised, modal, and path- entangled photons using a directional coupler and an asymmetric Y-coupler geometry in type 0 phase-matched domain engineered lithium niobate(LN) waveguide. The nonlinearity in LN is tailored in such a way that quasi phase matching conditions for two different spontaneous parametric down conversion processes are obeyed simultaneously, leading to a modal and path-entangled state at the output. Assuming typical values of various parameters, we show, through numerical simulations, that an almost maximally entangled state is achievable over a wide range of waveguide parameters. For the degenerate case, the scheme gives a NOON state for N = 2. The generated entangled photon pairs should have potential applications in quantum information schemes and also in quantum metrology. By appropriate domain engineering and component designing, the idea can be further extended to generate hyperentangled and two-photon multipath-entangled states, which may have further applications in quantum computation protocols.

<p>
Hard-core bosons on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion are a prototypical example of a system with supersolid behavior on a lattice. We show that in this model the physical origin of the supersolid phase can be understood quantitatively and analytically by constructing quasiparticle excitations of defects that are moving on an ordered background. The location of the solid to supersolid phase transition line is predicted from the effective model for both positive and negative (frustrated) hopping parameters. For positive hopping parameters the calculations agree very accurately with numerical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical results indicate that the supersolid to superfluid transition is first order.

We define the quadratic algebra su(2)<em>{\alpha} which is a one-parameter deformation of the Lie algebra su(2) extended by a parity operator. The odd-dimensional representations of su(2) (with representation label j, a positive integer) can be extended to representations of su(2)</em>{\alpha}. We investigate a model of the finite one-dimensional harmonic oscillator based upon this algebra su(2)_{\alpha}. It turns out that in this model the spectrum of the position and momentum operator can be computed explicitly, and that the corresponding (discrete) wavefunctions can be determined in terms of Hahn polynomials. The operation mapping position wavefunctions into momentum wavefunctions is studied, and this so-called discrete Hahn-Fourier transform is computed explicitly. The matrix of this discrete Hahn-Fourier transform has many interesting properties, similar to those of the traditional discrete Fourier transform.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to coherently couple arbitrary harmonic oscillators in a fully-controlled way is an important tool to process quantum information. Coupling between quantum harmonic oscillators has previously been demonstrated in several physical systems by use of a two-level system as a mediating element. Direct interaction at the quantum level has only recently been realized by use of resonant coupling between trapped ions. Here we implement a tunable direct coupling between the microwave harmonics of a superconducting resonator by use of parametric frequency conversion. We accomplish this by coupling the mode currents of two harmonics through a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and modulating its flux at the difference (~ 7 GHz) of the harmonic frequencies. We deterministically prepare a single-photon Fock state and coherently manipulate it between multiple modes, effectively controlling it in a superposition of two different &quot;colours&quot;. This parametric interaction can be described as a beam-splitter-like operation that couples different frequency modes. As such, it could be used to implement linear optical quantum computing protocols on-chip.

We show that the bosonic self-energy is the crucial ingredient for the description of critical fluctuations, but that many-body vertex corrections need to be incorporated as well in order to obtain quantitative agreement of the diagrammatics with the numerical simulations. Our results suggest that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in dissipative models beyond the Bloch-Redfield regime should be reconsidered in the long-time limit. Regarding also the spin-boson Hamiltonian as a toy model of quantum criticality, some of the insights gained here may be relevant for field theories of electrons coupled to bosons in higher dimensions.

<p><strong>25.    QIS-XML: An Extensible Markup Language for Quantum Information Science</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
This Master thesis examines issues of interoperability and integration between the Classic Information Science (CIS) and Quantum Information Science (QIS). It provides a short introduction to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and proceeds to describe the development steps that have lead to a prototype XML specification for quantum computing (QIS-XML). QIS-XML is a proposed framework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize, exchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a potential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers through the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the description of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools to visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also presented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and running the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial effort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the architecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a widely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and quantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and facilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would support the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum Information Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could be referred to as the &quot;Information Science Grand Unification Challenge&quot;.

<blockquote>
<p>
Spin qubits involving individual spins in single quantum dots or coupled spins in double quantum dots have emerged as potential building blocks for quantum information processing applications. It has been suggested that triple quantum dots may provide additional tools and functionalities. These include the encoding of information to either obtain protection from decoherence or to permit all-electrical operation, efficient spin busing across a quantum circuit, and to enable quantum error correction utilizing the three-spin Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger quantum state. Towards these goals we demonstrate for the first time coherent manipulation between two interacting three-spin states. We employ the Landau-Zener-St\&quot;uckelberg approach for creating and manipulating coherent superpositions of quantum states. We confirm that we are able to maintain coherence when decreasing the exchange coupling of one spin with another while simultaneously increasing its coupling with the third. Such control of pairwise exchange is a requirement of most spin qubit architectures but has not been previously demonstrated.

<blockquote>
<p>
Topologically-protected edge states are dissipationless conducting surface states immune to impurity scattering and geometrical defects that occur in electronic systems characterized by a bulk insulating gap. One example can be found in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) under high magnetic field in the quantum Hall regime. Based on the coherent control of the coupling between these protected states, several theoretical proposals for the implementation of information processing architectures were proposed. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a new method that allows us to controllably couple co-propagating spin-resolved edge states of a QH insulator. The scheme exploits a spatially-periodic in-plane magnetic field that is created by an array of Cobalt nano-magnets placed at the boundary of the 2DEG. A maximum charge/spin transfer of about 28% is achieved at 250 mK. This result may open the way to the realization of scalable quantum-information architectures exploiting the spin degree of freedom of topologically-protected states.

<p><strong>28.    A quantum-dynamical theory for nonlinear optical interactions in graphene</strong><br>
Zheshen Zhang, Paul L. Voss<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4838">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4838</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We use a quantum-dynamical model to investigate the optical response of graphene under low excitation power. Ultrafast carrier relaxation processes, which play an important role for understanding the optical response of graphene, are included phenomenologically into the model. We obtain analytical solutions for the linear and third-order nonlinear optical response of graphene, and four-wave mixing in particular. This theory shows agreement with recently reported experimental data on linear complex optical conductivity and four-wave mixing, providing evidence for ultrafast quantum-dephasing times of approximately 1 fs.

<p><strong>29.    Quantum versus classical counting in nonMarkovian master equations</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. B 84, 085425 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5219">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5219</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the description of full counting statistics in quantum transport with a nonMarkovian master equation. We focus on differences arising from whether charge is considered as a classical or a quantum degree of freedom. These differences manifest themselves in the inhomogeneous term of the master equation which describes initial correlations. We describe the influence on current and in particular, the finite-frequency shotnoise. We illustrate these ideas by studying transport through a quantum dot and give results that include both sequential and cotunneling processes. Importantly, the noise spectra derived from the classical description are essentially frequency-independent and all quantum noise effects are absent. These effects are fully recovered when charge is considered as a quantum degree of freedom.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new all-optical method to image individual atoms within dense atomic gases. The scheme exploits interaction induced shifts on highly polarizable excited states, which can be spatially resolved via an electromagnetically induced transparency resonance. We focus in particular on imaging strongly interacting many-body states of Rydberg atoms embedded in an ultracold gas of ground state atoms. Using a realistic model we show that it is possible to image individual impurity atoms with enhanced sensitivity and high resolution despite photon shot noise and atomic density fluctuations. This new imaging scheme is ideally suited to equilibrium and dynamical studies of complex many-body phenomena involving strongly interacting atoms. As an example we study blockade effects and correlations in the distribution of Rydberg atoms optically excited from a dense gas.

<p><strong>31.    Non-Markovian Second-Order Quantum Master Equation and Its Markovian Limit: Electronic Energy Transfer in Model Photosynthetic Systems</strong><br>
Navinder Singh, Paul Brumer<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5911">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5911</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A direct numerical algorithm for solving the time-nonlocal non-Markovian master equation in the second Born approximation is introduced and the range of utility of this approximation, and of the Markov approximation, is analyzed for the traditional dimer system that models excitation energy transfer in photosynthesis. Specifically, the coupled integro-differential equations for the reduced density matrix are solved by an efficient auxiliary function method in both the energy and site representations. In addition to giving exact results to this order, the approach allows us to computationally assess the range of the reorganization energy and decay rates of the phonon auto-correlation function for which the Markovian Redfield theory and the second order approximation is valid. For example, the use of Redfield theory for $\lambda&gt; 10 \textrm{cm}^{-1}$ in systems like Fenna-Mathews-Olson (FMO) type systems is shown to be in error. In addition, analytic inequalities are obtained for the regime of validity of the Markov approximation in cases of weak and strong resonance coupling, allowing for a quick determination of the utility of the Markovian dynamics in parameter regions. Finally, results for the evolution of states in a dimer system, with and without initial coherence, are compared in order to assess the role of initial coherences.

<p><strong>32.    The effect of extreme confinement on the nonlinear-optical response of quantum wires</strong><br>
Shoresh Shafei, Mark G. Kuzyk<br>
J. Nonl. Opt. Phys. Mat. 20, 427 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6017">http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6017</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This work focuses on understanding the nonlinear-optical response of a 1-D quantum wire embedded in 2-D space when quantum-size effects in the transverse direction are minimized using an extremely weighted delta function potential. Our aim is to establish the fundamental basis for understanding the effect of geometry on the nonlinear-optical response of quantum loops that are formed into a network of quantum wires. Using the concept of leaky quantum wires, it is shown that in the limit of full confinement, the sum rules are obeyed when the transverse infinite-energy continuum states are included. While the continuum states associated with the transverse wavefunction do not contribute to the nonlinear optical response, they are essential to preserving the validity of the sum rules. This work is a building block for future studies of nonlinear-optical enhancement of quantum graphs (which include loops and bent wires) based on their geometry. These properties are important in quantum mechanical modeling of any response function of quantum-confined systems, including the nonlinear-optical response of any system in which there is confinement in at leat one dimension, such as nanowires, which provide confinement in two dimensions.
