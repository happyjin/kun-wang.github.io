    <p><strong>1.    Threshold error rates for the toric and surface codes</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The surface code scheme for quantum computation features a 2d array of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits yet claims a threshold error rate approaching 1% (NJoP 9:199, 2007). This result was obtained for the toric code, from which the surface code is derived, and surpasses all other known codes restricted to 2d nearest-neighbor architectures by several orders of magnitude. We describe in detail an error correction procedure for the toric and surface codes, which is based on polynomial-time graph matching techniques and is efficiently implementable as the classical feed-forward processing step in a real quantum computer. By direct simulation of this error correction scheme, we determine the threshold error rates for the two codes (differing only in their boundary conditions) for both ideal and non-ideal syndrome extraction scenarios. We verify that the toric code has an asymptotic threshold of p = 15.5% under ideal syndrome extraction, and p = 7.8 10^-3 for the non-ideal case, in agreement with prior work. Simulations of the surface code indicate that the threshold is close to that of the toric code.

<p>
The Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces leads to thermodynamic and experimental inconsistencies when the role of drifting charge carriers is included in the model of the dielectric response. Recently modified reflection coefficients were suggested that take into account screening effects and diffusion currents. We demonstrate that this theoretical approach leads to a violation of the third law of thermodynamics (Nernst&#39;s heat theorem) for a wide class of materials and is excluded by the data from two recent experiments. The physical reason for its failure is explained by the violation of thermal equilibrium, which is the fundamental applicability condition of the Lifshitz theory, in the presence of drift and diffusion currents.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum-information transfer in a coupled resonator waveguide</strong><br>
Peng-Bo Li, Ying Gu, Qi-Huang Gong, Guang-Can Guo<br>
PHYSICAL REVIEW A 79, 042339 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0943">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0943</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an efficient scheme for the implementation of quantum information transfer in a onedimensional coupled resonator waveguide. We show that, based on the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms mediated by the cavity modes, Raman transitions between the atoms trapped in different nodes can take place. Quantum information could be transferred directly between the opposite ends of the coupled waveguide without involving the intermediate nodes via either Raman transitions or the stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. Since this scheme, in principle, is a one-step protocol, it may provide useful applications in quantum communications.

<blockquote>
<p>
We obtain new types of exponential decay laws for solutions of density-matrix master equations in the weak-coupling limit: after comparing with results already present in the literature and developing the necessary techniques, we study the crucial aspect of complete positivity under fairly general conditions. We propose a new type of time average that guarantees complete positivity and approximates, in markovian fashion, the exact dynamics for a plethora of physical applications, no matter which are the spectral properties of the subsystem, or its dimensions. We shall comment on some interesting examples, like a new Quantum version of the celebrated Fermi&#39;s Golden Rule and some recently proposed entangling projections.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1139">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1139</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive simple models for the dynamics of a single atom coupled to a cavity field mode in the absorptive bistable parameter regime by projecting the time evolution of the state of the system onto a suitably chosen nonlinear low-dimensional manifold, which is found by use of local tangent space alignment. The output field from the cavity is detected with a homodyne detector allowing observation of quantum jumps of the system between states with different average numbers of photons in the cavity. We find that the models, which are significantly faster to integrate numerically than the full stochastic master equation, largely reproduce the dynamics of the system, and we demonstrate that they are sufficiently accurate to facilitate feedback control of the state of the system based on the predictions of the models alone.

<p><strong>7.    Experimental demonstration of topological error correction</strong><br>
Wei-Bo Gao, Austin G. Fowler, Robert Raussendorf, Xing-Can Yao, He Lu, Ping Xu, Chao-Yang Lu, Cheng-Zhi Peng, Youjin Deng, Zeng-Bing Chen, Jian-Wei Pan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1542">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1542</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Topological error correction--a novel method to actively correct errors based on cluster states with topological properties--has the highest order of tolerable error rates known to date (10^{-2}). Moreover, the scheme requires only nearest-neighbour interaction, particularly suitable for most physical systems. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of topological error correction with an 8-qubit optical cluster state. In the experiment, it is shown that a correlation can be protected against a single error on any single qubit. In addition, when all qubits are simultaneously subjected to errors with equal probability, the effective error rate is significantly reduced, clearly verifying the advantage of topological error correction. The quantum gate with the error rate below the threshold is within the current experimental technology. We believe topological error correction should be a critical ingredient for the future large-scale quantum computation.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum Error Correction for Beginners</strong><br>
Simon J. Devitt, Kae Nemoto, William J. Munro<br>
Rep. Prog. Phys. 76 (2013) 076001<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2794">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2794</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.

In particular, we present non-classical interference of photon pairs in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer constructed with X couplers in an integrated optical circuit with a thermo-optic phase shifter in one of the interferometer arms.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2942">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2942</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the quantum stochastic walk (QSW), which determines the evolution of generalized quantum mechanical walk on a graph that obeys a quantum stochastic equation of motion. Using an axiomatic approach, we specify the rules for all possible quantum, classical and quantum-stochastic transitions from a vertex as defined by its connectivity. We show how the family of possible QSWs encompasses both the classical random walk (CRW) and the quantum walk (QW) as special cases, but also includes more general probability distributions. As an example, we study the QSW on a line, the QW to CRW transition and transitions to genearlized QSWs that go beyond the CRW and QW. QSWs provide a new framework to the study of quantum algorithms as well as of quantum walks with environmental effects.

<p><strong>13.    Fiber-coupled semiconductor waveguides as an efficient optical interface to a single quantum dipole</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically investigate the interaction of a single quantum dipole with the modes of a fiber-coupled semiconductor waveguide. Through a combination of tight modal confinement and phase-matched evanescent coupling, we predict that approximately 70 % of the dipole&#39;s emission can be collected into a single mode optical fiber. Calculations further show that the dipole strongly modifies resonant light transmission through the system, with over an order of magnitude change possible for an appropriate choice of fiber-waveguide coupler geometry.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3413">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3413</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Computing the ground-state energy of interacting electron (fermion) problems has recently been shown to be hard for QMA, a quantum analogue of the complexity class NP. Fermionic problems are usually hard, a phenomenon widely attributed to the so-called sign problem occurring in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The corresponding bosonic problems are, according to conventional wisdom, tractable. Here, we discuss the complexity of interacting boson problems and show that they are also QMA-hard. In addition, we show that the bosonic version of the so-called N-representability problem is QMA-complete, as hard as its fermionic version. As a consequence, these problems are unlikely to have efficient quantum algorithms.

<p>
Unconditionally secure bit commitment is forbidden by quantum mechanics. We extend this no-go theorem to continuous-variable protocols where both players are restricted to use Gaussian states and operations, which is a reasonable assumption in current-state optical implementations. Our Gaussian no-go theorem also provides a natural counter-example to a conjecture that quantum mechanics can be rederived from the assumption that key distribution is allowed while bit commitment is forbidden in Nature.

<p><strong>16.    Moyal phase-space analysis of nonlinear optical Kerr media</strong><br>
T. A. Osborn, Karl-Peter Marzlin<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3530">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3530</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear optical media of Kerr type are described by a particular version of an anharmonic quantum harmonic oscillator. The dynamics of this system can be described using the Moyal equations of motion, which correspond to a quantum phase space representation of the Heisenberg equations of motion. For the Kerr system we derive exact solutions of the Moyal equations for a complete set of observables formed from the photon creation and annihilation operators. These Moyal solutions incorporate the asymptotics of the classical limit in a simple explicit form. An unusual feature of these solutions is that they exhibit periodic singularities in the time variable. These singularities are removed by the phase space averaging required to construct the expectation value for an arbitrary initial state. Nevertheless, for strongly number-squeezed initial states the effects of the singularity remain observable.

<p><strong>17.    Spin and Orbital Rotation of Electrons and Photons via Spin-Orbit Interaction</strong><br>
C.C. Leary, M.G. Raymer, S.J. van Enk<br>
Phys. Rev. A 80, 061804 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3778">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3778</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that when an electron or photon propagates in a cylindrically symmetric waveguide, its spin angular momentum (SAM) and its orbital angular momentum (OAM) interact. Remarkably, we find that the dynamics resulting from this spin-orbit interaction are quantitatively described by a single expression applying to both electrons and photons. This leads to the prediction of several novel rotational effects: the spatial or time evolution of either particle&#39;s spin/polarization vector is controlled by the sign of its OAM quantum number, or conversely, its spatial wavefunction is controlled by its SAM. We show that the common origin of these effects in electrons and photons is a universal geometric phase. We demonstrate how these phenomena can be used to reversibly transfer entanglement between the SAM and OAM degrees of freedom of two-particle states.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3838">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3838</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum channel models the interaction between the system we are interested in and its environment. Such a model can capture the main features of the interaction but because of the complexity of the environment we can not assume that it is fully accurate. We study the robustness of quantum error correction operations against completely unexpected and subsequently undetermined type of channel uncertainties. We find that a channel-adapted optimal error correction operation does not only give the best possible channel fidelity but it is more robust against channel alterations than any other error correction operation. Our results are valid for Pauli channels and stabilizer codes but based on some numerical results we believe that very similar conclusions can be drawn also in the general case.

Joseph Kerckhoff, Hideo Mabuchi<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4261">http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4261</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Contemporary experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) with gas-phase neutral atoms rely increasingly on laser cooling and optical, magneto-optical or magnetostatic trapping methods to provide atomic localization with sub-micron uncertainty. Difficult to achieve in free space, this goal is further frustrated by atom-surface interactions if the desired atomic placement approaches within several hundred nanometers of a solid surface, as can be the case in setups incorporating monolithic dielectric optical resonators such as microspheres, microtoroids, microdisks or photonic crystal defect cavities. Typically in such scenarios, the smallest atom-surface separation at which the van der Waals interaction can be neglected is taken to be the optimal localization point for associated trapping schemes, but this sort of conservative strategy generally compromises the achievable cavity QED coupling strength. Here we suggest a new approach to the design of optical dipole traps for atom confinement near surfaces that exploits strong surface interactions, rather than avoiding them, and present the results of a numerical study based on $^{39}$K atoms and indium tin oxide (ITO). Our theoretical framework points to the possibility of utilizing nanopatterning methods to engineer novel modifications of atom-surface interactions.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this short review, I draw attention to new developments in the theory of fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete direction to future work in the development of superconducting qubit systems. The basics of quantum error correction codes, which I will briefly review, have not significantly changed since their introduction fifteen years ago. But an interesting picture has emerged of an efficient use of these codes that may put fault tolerant operation within reach. It is now understood that two dimensional surface codes, close relatives of the original toric code of Kitaev, can be adapted to effectively perform logical gate operations in a very simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault tolerant operation simulated to be 0.75%. This architecture uses topological ideas in its functioning, but it is not &#39;topological quantum computation&#39; -- there are no non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.

<blockquote>
<p>
Spin-tomographic symbols of qudit states and spin observables are studied. Spin observables are associated with the functions on a manifold whose points are labelled by spin projections and 2-sphere coordinates. The star-product kernel for such functions is obtained in explicit form and connected with Fourier transform of characters of SU(2) irreducible representation. The kernels are shown to be in close relation to the Chebyshev polynomials. Using specific properties of these polynomials, we establish the recurrence relation between kernels for different spins. Employing the explicit form of the star-product kernel, a sum rule for Clebsch-Gordan and Racah coefficients is derived. Explicit formulas are obtained for the dual tomographic star-product kernel as well as for intertwining kernels which relate spin-tomographic symbols and dual tomographic symbols.

This note describes some cryptographic issues related to multi-located parties. In general, multi-located parties make it difficult for the eavesdropper to mount the man-in-the-middle attack.
