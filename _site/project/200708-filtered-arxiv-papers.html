Alexander Yu. Vlasov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0145">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0145</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A programmable quantum networks model is used in this paper for development of methods of control of a quantum state transport. These methods may be applied for a wide variety of patterns of controlled state transmission and spreading in quantum systems. The programmable perfect state transfer and quantum walk, mobile quantum (ro)bots and lattice gas automata may be described by unified way with such approach.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum walks on the cycle in the non-stationary case where the `coin&#39; operation is allowed to change at each time step. We characterize, in algebraic terms, the set of possible state transfers and prove that, as opposed to the stationary case, it is possible to asymnptotically reach a uniform distribution among the nodes of the associated graph.

<p><strong>3.    Correlated projection operator approach to non-Markovian dynamics in spin baths</strong><br>
Jan Fischer, Heinz-Peter Breuer<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0410">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0410</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of an open quantum system is usually studied by performing a weak-coupling and weak-correlation expansion in the system-bath interaction. For systems exhibiting strong couplings and highly non-Markovian behavior this approach is not justified. We apply a recently proposed correlated projection superoperator technique to the model of a central spin coupled to a spin bath via full Heisenberg interaction. Analytical solutions to both the Nakajima-Zwanzig and the time-convolutionless master equation are determined and compared with the results of the exact solution. The correlated projection operator technique significantly improves the standard methods and can be applied to many physical problems such as the hyperfine interaction in a quantum dot.

<p>
We report a practical non-postselection entanglement concentration scheme in which a maximally entangled Bell-state photon pair is produced from two pairs of partially (or non-maximally) entangled photons. Since this scheme is built only upon linear optical elements and does not require photon-number resolving detectors, it has immediate applications in experimental implementations of various quantum information protocols which require two-photon Bell-states.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report a scalable linear optical scheme for generating entangled states of multiple ququarts in which the individual single-ququart state is prepared with the biphoton polarization state of frequency-nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The output state is calculated with the full consideration of the higher order effect (double-pair events) of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Scalability to multiple-ququart entanglement is demonstrated with examples: linear optical entanglement of three and four individual biphoton ququarts.

<p><strong>6.    Nonmaximally entangled states can be better for multiple linear optical teleportation</strong><br>
Joanna Modlawska, Andrzej Grudka<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 110503 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0667">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0667</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate multiple linear optical teleportation in the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme with both maximally and nonmaximally entangled states. We show that if the qubit is teleported several times via nonmaximally entangled state then the errors introduced in the previous teleportations can be corrected by the errors introduced in the following teleportations. This effect is so strong that it leads to another interesting phenomenon, i.e., the total probability of successful multiple linear optical teleportation is higher for nonmaximally entangled states than maximally entangled states.

<p><strong>7.    Statistical comparison of ensemble implementations of Grover&#39;s search algorithm to classical sequential searches</strong><br>
Tomasz M. Kott, David Collins<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0808">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0808</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare pseudopure state ensemble implementations, quantified by their initial polarization and ensemble size, of Grover&#39;s search algorithm to probabilistic classical sequential search algorithms in terms of their success and failure probabilities. We propose a criterion for quantifying the resources used by the ensemble implementation via the aggregate number of oracle invocations across the entire ensemble and use this as a basis for comparison with classical search algorithms. We determine bounds for a critical polarization such that the ensemble algorithm succeeds with a greater probability than the probabilistic classical sequential search. Our results indicate that the critical polarization scales as N^(-1/4) where N is the database size and that for typical room temperature solution state NMR, the polarization is such that the ensemble implementation of Grover&#39;s algorithm would be advantageous for N &gt; 10^22

<p>
We present an imperative quantum programming language LanQ which was designed to support combination of quantum and classical programming and basic process operations - process creation and interprocess communication. The language can thus be used for implementing both classical and quantum algorithms and protocols. Its syntax is similar to that of C language what makes it easy to learn for existing programmers. In this paper, we present operational semantics of the language and a proof of type soundness of the noncommunicating part of the language. We provide an example run of a quantum random number generator.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum Walks on a Random Environment</strong><br>
Yue Yin, D.E. Katsanos, S.N. Evangelou<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1137">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1137</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are considered in a one-dimensional random medium characterized by static or dynamic disorder. Quantum interference for static disorder can lead to Anderson localization which completely hinders the quantum walk and it is contrasted with the decoherence effect of dynamic disorder having strength W, where a quantum to classical crossover at time $t_{c}\propto W^{-2}$ transforms the quantum walk into an ordinary random walk with diffusive spreading. We demonstrate these localization and decoherence phenomena in quantum carpets of the observed time evolution and examine in detail a dimer lattice which corresponds to a single qubit subject to randomness.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the effect of different unitary noise mechanisms on the evolution of a quantum walk (QW) on a linear chain with a generic coin operation: (i) bit-flip channel noise, restricted to the coin subspace of the QW, and (ii) topological noise caused by randomly broken links in the linear chain. Similarities and differences in the respective decoherent dynamics of the walker as a function of the probability per unit time of a decoherent event taking place are discussed.

<p><strong>11.    A quantum dot implementation of the quantum NAND algorithm</strong><br>
J. M. Taylor<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1484">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1484</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a physical implementation of the quantum NAND tree evaluation algorithm. Our approach, based on continuous time quantum walks, uses the wave interference of a single electron in a heirarchical set of tunnel coupled quantum dots. We find that the query complexity of the NAND tree evaluation does not suffer strongly from disorder and dephasing, nor is it directly limited by temperature or restricted dimensionality for 2-d structures. Finally, we suggest a potential application of this algorithm to the efficient determination of high-order correlation functions of complex quantum systems.

<p><strong>12.    Optimizing Optical Quantum Logic Gates using Genetic Algorithms</strong><br>
Zhanghan Wu, Sean D. Huver, Dmitry Uskov, Hwang Lee, Jonathan P. Dowling<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1498">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1498</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the method of using an annealing genetic algorithm to the numerically complex problem of looking for quantum logic gates which simultaneously have highest fidelity and highest success probability. We first use the linear optical quantum nonlinear sign (NS) gate as an example to illustrate the efficiency of this method. We show that by appropriately choosing the annealing parameters, we can reach the theoretical maximum success probability (1/4 for NS) for each attempt. We then examine the controlled-z (CZ) gate as the first new problem to be solved. We show results that agree with the highest known maximum success probability for a CZ gate (2/27) while maintaining a fidelity of 0.9997. Since the purpose of our algorithm is to optimize a unitary matrix for quantum transformations, it could easily be applied to other areas of interest such as quantum optics and quantum sensors.

<p><strong>13.    Investigation on the superluminality of evanescent modes via quantum Lorentz transformation</strong><br>
Zhi-Yong Wang, Cai-Dong Xiong<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1559">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1559</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Applying the fact that guided photons inside a waveguide can be treated as massive particles, one can study the superluminality of evanescent modes via showing that a massive particle can propagate over a spacelike interval, which corresponds to quantum tunneling effects. For this purpose, we treat the particle as a quantum reference frame, while attach an inertia observer to a classical reference frame, and then quantize the formulae for the Lorentz transformation between the quantum and classical reference frames, from which we obtain the conclusion that, owing to the Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty relation, the particle can propagate over a spacelike interval.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1953">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1953</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a generalized theory of quantum error correction (QEC) that applies to any linear map, in particular maps that are not completely positive (CP). This theory describes entanglement-assisted QEC for invertible noise maps, which we use to provides an example of the physical implementation of non-CP recovery maps. We argue that a consistent map-based theory of fault-tolerant QEC (whether Markovian or not) requires linear, non-CP maps, and that this impacts the value of the fault-tolerance threshold.

<p>
A classical lazy random walk on cycles is known to mix to the uniform distribution. In contrast, we show that a continuous-time quantum walk on cycles exhibit strong non-uniform mixing properties. Our results include the following: - The instantaneous distribution of a quantum walk on most even-length cycles is never uniform. - The average distribution of a quantum walk on any Abelian circulant graph is never uniform. As a corollary, the average distribution of a quantum walk on any standard circulant graph, such as the cycles, complete graphs, and even hypercubes, is never uniform.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2142">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2142</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) make use of pre-existing entanglement between the sender and receiver to boost the rate of transmission. It is possible to construct an EAQECC from any classical linear code, unlike standard QECCs which can only be constructed from dual-containing codes. Operator quantum error-correcting codes (OQECCs) allow certain errors to be corrected (or prevented) passively, reducing the complexity of the correction procedure. We combine these two extensions of standard quantum error correction into a unified entanglement-assisted quantum error correction formalism. This new scheme, which we call entanglement-assisted operator quantum error correction (EAOQEC), is the most general and powerful quantum error-correcting technique known, retaining the advantages of both entanglement-assistance and passive correction. We present the formalism, show the considerable freedom in constructing EAOQECCs from classical codes, and demonstrate the construction with examples.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2201">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2201</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare and contrast three different perturbative expansions for the quartic anharmonic oscillator wavefunction and apply a modified Borel summation technique to determine the energy eigenvalues. In the first two expansions this provides the energy eigenvalues directly however in the third method we tune the wavefunctions to achieve the correct large x behaviour. This tuning technique allows us to determine the energy eigenvalues up to an arbitrary level of accuracy with remarkable efficiency. We give numerical evidence to explain this behaviour. We also refine the modified Borel summation technique to improve its accuracy. The main sources of error are investigated with reasonable error corrections calculated.

<blockquote>
<p>
Two-mode nonlinear interaction (second-harmonic and second-subharmonic generation) in a planar waveguide with a small periodic corrugation at the surface is studied. Scattering of the interacting fields on the corrugation leads to constructive interference that enhances the nonlinear process provided that all the interactions are phase matched. Conditions for the overall phase matching are found. Compared with a perfectly quasi-phase-matched waveguide, better values of squeezing as well as higher intensities are reached under these conditions. Procedure for finding optimum values of parameters for squeezed-light generation is described.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2257">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2257</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the dynamics of bipartite entanglement between a two-level atom and the electromagnetic field. We treat the Jaynes-Cummings model with a single field mode and examine in detail the exact time evolution of entanglement, including cases where the atomic state is initially mixed and the atomic transition is detuned from resonance. We then explore the effects of other nearby modes by calculating the exact time evolution of entanglement in more complex systems with two, three, and five field modes. For these cases we can obtain exact solutions which include the strong coupling regimes. Finally, we consider the entanglement of a two-level atom with the infinite collection of modes present in the intracavity field of a Fabre-Perot cavity. In contrast to the usual treatment of atom-field interactions with a continuum of modes using the Born-Markov approximation, our treatment in all cases describes the full non-Markovian dynamics of the atomic subsystem. Only when an analytic expression for the infinite mode case is desired do we need to make a weak coupling assumption which at long times approximates Markovian dynamics.

Unambiguously distinguishing between nonorthogonal but linearly independent quantum states is a challenging problem in quantum information processing. In this work, an exact analytic solution to an optimum measurement problem involving an arbitrary number of pure linearly independent quantum states is presented. To this end, the relevant semi-definite programming task is reduced to a linear programming one with a feasible region of polygon type which can be solved via simplex method. The strength of the method is illustrated through some explicit examples. Also using the close connection between the Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition(LSD) and semi-definite programming approach, the optimal positive operator valued measure for some of the well-known examples is obtain via Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition method. {\bf Keywords:} Optimal Unambiguous State Discrimination, Linear Programming, Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition. {\bf PACs Index: 03.67.Hk, 03.65.Ta, 42.50.-p

<p><strong>21.    Secure Identification and QKD in the Bounded-Quantum-Storage Model</strong><br>
Ivan Damgaard, Serge Fehr, Louis Salvail, Christian Schaffner<br>
full version of CRYPTO 2007, LNCS 4622, pages 342-359<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2557">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2557</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of secure identification: user U proves to server S that he knows an agreed (possibly low-entropy) password w, while giving away as little information on w as possible, namely the adversary can exclude at most one possible password for each execution of the scheme. We propose a solution in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where U and S may exchange qubits, and a dishonest party is assumed to have limited quantum memory. No other restriction is posed upon the adversary. An improved version of the proposed identification scheme is also secure against a man-in-the-middle attack, but requires U and S to additionally share a high-entropy key k. However, security is still guaranteed if one party loses k to the attacker but notices the loss. In both versions of the scheme, the honest participants need no quantum memory, and noise and imperfect quantum sources can be tolerated. The schemes compose sequentially, and w and k can securely be re-used. A small modification to the identification scheme results in a quantum-key-distribution (QKD) scheme, secure in the bounded-quantum-storage model, with the same re-usability properties of the keys, and without assuming authenticated channels. This is in sharp contrast to known QKD schemes (with unbounded adversary) without authenticated channels, where authentication keys must be updated, and unsuccessful executions can cause the parties to run out of keys.

<p>
For a system composed of nine qubits, we show that natural interactions among the qubits induce the time evolution that can be regarded, at discrete times, as the Rabi oscillation of a logical qubit. Neither fine tuning of the parameters nor switching of the interactions is necessary. Although straightforward application of quantum error correction fails, we propose a protocol by which the logical Rabi oscillation is protected against all single-qubit errors. The present method thus opens a simple and realistic way of protecting the unitary time evolution against noise.

The goal of the ordered search problem is to find a particular item in an ordered list of n items. Using the adversary method, Hoyer, Neerbek, and Shi proved a quantum lower bound for this problem of (1/pi) ln n + Theta(1). Here, we find the exact value of the best possible quantum adversary lower bound for a symmetrized version of ordered search (whose query complexity differs from that of the original problem by at most 1). Thus we show that the best lower bound for ordered search that can be proved by the adversary method is (1/pi) ln n + O(1). Furthermore, we show that this remains true for the generalized adversary method allowing negative weights.

Centre-of-mass atomic motion in an optical lattice near the resonance is shown to be a chaotic walking due to the interplay between coherent internal atomic dynamics and spontaneous emission. Statistical properties of chaotic atomic motion can be controlled by the single parameter, the detuning between the atomic transition frequency and the laser frequency. We derive a Fokker-Planck equation in the energetic space to describe the atomic transport near the resonance and demonstrate numerically how to manipulate the atomic motion varying the detuning.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3658">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3658</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a class of numerical algorithms which adapt a quantum error correction scheme to a channel model. Given an encoding and a channel model, it was previously shown that the quantum operation that maximizes the average entanglement fidelity may be calculated by a semidefinite program (SDP), which is a convex optimization. While optimal, this recovery operation is computationally difficult for long codes. Furthermore, the optimal recovery operation has no structure beyond the completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) constraint. We derive methods to generate structured channel-adapted error recovery operations. Specifically, each recovery operation begins with a projective error syndrome measurement. The algorithms to compute the structured recovery operations are more scalable than the SDP and yield recovery operations with an intuitive physical form. Using Lagrange duality, we derive performance bounds to certify near-optimality.

A semiclassical approximation for an evolving density operator, driven by a &quot;closed&quot; hamiltonian operator and &quot;open&quot; markovian Lindblad operators, is obtained. The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform of the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master equation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad operators are linear functions of positions and momenta. Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad operators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated by an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra &quot;open&quot; term is added to the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators in the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of generic hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is studied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the corresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace, which supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its conjugate subspace, which supports the chord function. Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the neighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function. This difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a further &quot;small-chord&quot; approximation leads to a simple generalization of the quadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions.

<p><strong>29.    Comment on ``Precision measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force in a fluid&#39;&#39;</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Recently J.N. Munday and F. Capasso [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 75}, 060102(R) (2007); arXiv:0705.3793] claimed that they have performed a precision measurement of the Casimir force between a sphere and a plate coated with Au, both immersed in ethanol. The measurement results were claimed to be consistent with the Lifshitz theory. We demonstrate that the calculation of the Casimir force between the smooth bodies following the authors prescription has a discrepancy up to 25% with respect to authors result. We show also that the attractive electrostatic force only due to the surface potential differences was underestimated by a factor of 590 and the charge double layer interaction was not taken into account. All this leads to the conclusion that the results of this experiment are in fact uncertain.

<p><strong>30.    Entangling a nanomechanical resonator and a superconducting microwave cavity</strong><br>
D. Vitali, P. Tombesi, M. J. Woolley, A. C. Doherty, G. J. Milburn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 042336 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1665">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1665</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme able to entangle at the steady state a nanomechanical resonator with a microwave cavity mode of a driven superconducting coplanar waveguide. The nanomechanical resonator is capacitively coupled with the central conductor of the waveguide and stationary entanglement is achievable up to temperatures of tens of milliKelvin.

<p><strong>31.    The Schr\&quot; odinger picture of the Dirac quantum mechanics on spatially flat Robertson-Walker backgrounds</strong><br>
Ion I. Cotaescu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0734">http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0734</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Schr\&quot; odinger picture of the Dirac quantum mechanics is defined in charts with spatially flat Robertson-Walker metrics and Cartesian coordinates. The main observables of this picture are identified, including the interacting part of the Hamiltonian operator produced by the minimal coupling with the gravitational field. It is shown that in this approach new Dirac quantum modes on de Sitter spacetimes may be found analytically solving the Dirac equation.
