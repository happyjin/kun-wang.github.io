    <p><strong>1.    Weak measurements are universal</strong><br>
Ognyan Oreshkov, Todd A. Brun<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 110409 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503017">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503017</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that any projective measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements, which cause only small changes to the state. Similar constructions for generalized measurements, however, have relied on the use of an ancilla system. We show that any generalized measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements without the use of an ancilla, and give an explicit construction for these weak measurements. The measurement procedure has the structure of a random walk along a curve in state space, with the measurement ending when one of the end points is reached. This shows that any measurement can be generated by weak measurements, and hence that weak measurements are universal. This may have important applications to the theory of entanglement.

<p>
A new notion of controllability, eigenstate controllability, is defined for finite-dimensional bilinear quantum mechanical systems which are neither strongly completely controllably nor completely controllable. And a quantum control algorithm based on Grover iteration is designed to perform a quantum control task of steering a system, which is eigenstate controllable but may not be (strongly) completely controllable, from an arbitrary state to a target state.

<p><strong>3.    Dependences of the van der Waals atom-wall interaction on atomic and material properties</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The 1%-accurate calculations of the van der Waals interaction between an atom and a cavity wall are performed in the separation region from 3 nm to 150 nm. The cases of metastable He${}^{\ast}$ and Na atoms near the metal, semiconductor or dielectric walls are considered. Different approximations to the description of wall material and atomic dynamic polarizability are carefully compared. The smooth transition to the Casimir-Polder interaction is verified. It is shown that to obtain accurate results for the atom-wall van der Waals interaction at shortest separations with an error less than 1% one should use the complete optical tabulated data for the complex refraction index of the wall material and the accurate dynamic polarizability of an atom. The obtained results may be useful for the theoretical interpretation of recent experiments on quantum reflection and Bose-Einstein condensation of ultracold atoms on or near surfaces of different nature.

<p><strong>4.    Ultrahigh-sensitivity high-linearity photodetection system using a low-gain avalanche photodiode with an ultralow-noise readout circuit</strong><br>

Optics Letters, 30(2), 123 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503048">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503048</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A highly sensitive photodetection system with a detection limit of 1 photon/s was developed. This system uses a commercially available 200-mm-diameter silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) and an in-house-developed ultralow-noise readout circuit, which are both cooled to 77 K. When the APD operates at a low gain of about 10, it has a high-linearity response to the number of incident photons and a low excess noise factor. The APD also has high quantum efficiency and a dark current of less than 1 e/s at 77 K. This photodetection system will shorten the measurement time and enable higher spatial and wavelength resolution for near-field scanning optical microscopes.

<p><strong>5.    Effective squeezing enhancement via measurement-induced non-Gaussian operation and its application to dense coding scheme</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503049">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503049</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the measurement-induced non-Gaussian operation on the single- and two-mode \textit{Gaussian} squeezed vacuum states with beam splitters and on-off type photon detectors, with which \textit{mixed non-Gaussian} states are generally obtained in the conditional process. It is known that the entanglement can be enhanced via this non-Gaussian operation on the two-mode squeezed vacuum state. We show that, in the range of practical squeezing parameters, the conditional outputs are still close to Gaussian states, but their second order variances of quantum fluctuations and correlations are effectively suppressed and enhanced, respectively. To investigate an operational meaning of these states, especially entangled states, we also evaluate the quantum dense coding scheme from the viewpoint of the mutual information, and we show that non-Gaussian entangled state can be advantageous compared with the original two-mode squeezed state.

<p><strong>7.    Security of Quantum Key Distribution with Realistic Devices</strong><br>
Xiongfeng Ma<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503057">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503057</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We simulate quantum key distribution (QKD) experimental setups and give out some improvement for QKD procedures. A new data post-processing protocol is introduced, mainly including error correction and privacy amplification. This protocol combines the ideas of GLLP and the decoy states, which essentially only requires to turn up and down the source power. We propose a practical way to perform the decoy state method, which mainly follows the idea of Lo&#39;s decoy state. A new data post-processing protocol is then developed for the QKD scheme with the decoy state. We first study the optimal expected photon number mu of the source for the improved QKD scheme. We get the new optimal mu=O(1) comparing with former mu=O(eta), where eta is the overall transmission efficiency. With this protocol, we can then improve the key generation rate from quadratic of transmission efficiency O(eta2) to O(eta). Based on the recent experimental setup, we obtain the maximum secure transmission distance of over 140 km.

<p><strong>8.    Some Mathematical Aspects of the Lifshitz Formula for the Thermal Casimir Force</strong><br>
V. M. Mostepanenko, A. O. Caride, G. L. Klimchitskaya, S. I. Zanette<br>
Proc. Sci. WC2004 (2005) 030.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503064">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503064</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The applicability of the Lifshitz formula is discussed to the case of two thick parallel plates made of real metal. The usual description of the zero-point vacuum oscillations on the background of the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity is shown to be in contradiction with thermodynamics. Instead, the Lifshitz formula for the Casimir free energy should be reformulated in terms of the reflection coefficients containing the surface impedance instead of the dielectric permittivity. This approach is presently confirmed experimentally by precision measurements of the van der Waals and Casimir forces in micromechanical systems and it is in agreement with thermodynamics.

<blockquote>
<p>
Basing on states and channels isomorphism we point out that semidefinite programming can be used as a quick test for nonzero one-way quantum channel capacity. This can be achieved by search of symmetric extensions of states isomorphic to a given quantum channel. With this method we provide examples of quantum channels that can lead to high entanglement transmission but still have zero one-way capacity, in particular, regions of symmetric extendibility for isotropic states in arbitrary dimensions are presented. Further we derive {\it a new entanglement parameter} based on (normalised) relative entropy distance to the set of states that have symmetric extensions and show explicitly the symmetric extension of isotropic states being the nearest to singlets in the set of symmetrically extendible states. The suitable regularisation of the parameter provides a new upper bound on one-way distillable entanglement.

We propose a novel implementation of discrete time quantum walks for a neutral atom in an array of optical microtraps or an optical lattice.

We analyze the dependence of the quantum walk on temperature and experimental imperfections as shaking in the trap positions. Finally, combining a spatially delocalized qubit and a hyperfine qubit, we also give a scheme to realize a quantum walk on a two-dimensional square lattice with the possibility of implementing different coin operators.

<p><strong>15.    The Power of Strong Fourier Sampling: Quantum Algorithms for Affine Groups and Hidden Shifts</strong><br>
Cristopher Moore, Daniel Rockmore, Alexander Russell, Leonard J. Schulman<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503095">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503095</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Many quantum algorithms, including Shor&#39;s celebrated factoring and discrete log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a Hidden Subgroup problem, in which an unknown subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a uniform superposition on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by Fourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier sampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full measurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably chosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method is indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show that hidden subgroups H of the q-hedral groups, i.e., semidirect products Z_q \ltimes Z_p where q | (p-1), and in particular the affine groups A_p, can be information-theoretically reconstructed using the strong standard method. Moreover, if |H| = p/ \polylog(p), these subgroups can be fully reconstructed with a polynomial amount of quantum and classical computation. We show that, for some q, neither the ``forgetful&#39;&#39; abelian method nor measuring in a random basis succeeds, even information-theoretically. Thus, at least for some groups, it is crucial to use the full power of representation theory: namely, to measure the high-dimensional representations in an adapted basis that respects the group&#39;s subgroup structure. We apply our algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem to new families of cryptographically motivated Hidden Shift problems, generalizing work of van Dam, Hallgren and Ip on shifts of multiplicative characters.

<p><strong>16.    On the Power of Random Bases in Fourier Sampling: Hidden Subgroup Problem in the Heisenberg Group</strong><br>
Jaikumar Radhakrishnan, Martin Roetteler, Pranab Sen<br>
Proceedings 32nd International Conference on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2005), Lisbon, Portugal, Springer LNCS, pp. 1399-1411, 2005<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503114">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503114</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The hidden subgroup problem (HSP) provides a unified framework to study problems of group-theoretical nature in quantum computing such as order finding and the discrete logarithm problem. While it is known that Fourier sampling provides an efficient solution in the abelian case, not much is known for general non-abelian groups. Recently, some authors raised the question as to whether post-processing the Fourier spectrum by measuring in a random orthonormal basis helps for solving the HSP. Several negative results on the shortcomings of this random strong method are known. In this paper however, we show that the random strong method can be quite powerful under certain conditions on the group G. We define a parameter r(G) for a group G and show that O((\log |G| / r(G))^2) iterations of the random strong method give enough classical information to identify a hidden subgroup in G. We illustrate the power of the random strong method via a concrete example of the HSP over finite Heisenberg groups. We show that r(G) = \Omega(1) for these groups; hence the HSP can be solved using polynomially many random strong Fourier samplings followed by a possibly exponential classical post-processing without further queries. The quantum part of our algorithm consists of a polynomial computation followed by measuring in a random orthonormal basis. This gives the first example of a group where random representation bases do help in solving the HSP and for which no explicit representation bases are known that solve the problem with (\log G)^O(1) Fourier samplings. As an interesting by-product of our work, we get an algorithm for solving the state identification problem for a set of nearly orthogonal pure quantum states.

<p><strong>17.    Approximate Quantum Error-Correcting Codes and Secret Sharing Schemes</strong><br>
Claude Crepeau, Daniel Gottesman, Adam Smith<br>
Preliminary version in proceedings of &quot;Advances in Cryptology -- EUROCRYPT 2005&quot;<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503139">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503139</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is a standard result in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes that no code of length n can fix more than n/4 arbitrary errors, regardless of the dimension of the coding and encoded Hilbert spaces. However, this bound only applies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect that correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations of this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors with fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of the registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp distinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes have the property that any $t$ components reveal no information about the message, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing schemes. The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and quantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better classical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error correction. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is n/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact and approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the delicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.

<blockquote>
<p>
The time-evolution equation of a one-dimensional quantum walker is exactly mapped to the three-dimensional Weyl equation for a zero-mass particle with spin 1/2, in which each wave number k of walker&#39;s wave function is mapped to a point \vec{q}(k) in the three-dimensional momentum space and \vec{q}(k) makes a planar orbit as k changes its value in [-\pi, \pi). The integration over k providing the real-space wave function for a quantum walker corresponds to considering an orbital state of a Weyl particle, which is defined as a superposition (curvilinear integration) of the energy-momentum eigenstates of a free Weyl equation along the orbit. Konno&#39;s novel distribution function of quantum-walker&#39;s pseudo-velocities in the long-time limit is fully controlled by the shape of the orbit and how the orbit is embedded in the three-dimensional momentum space. The family of orbital states can be regarded as a geometrical representation of the unitary group U(2) and the present study will propose a new group-theoretical point of view for quantum-walk problems.

<blockquote>
<p>
Algebraic geometrical concepts are playing an increasing role in quantum applications such as coding, cryptography, tomography and computing. We point out here the prominent role played by Galois fields viewed as cyclotomic extensions of the integers modulo a prime characteristic $p$. They can be used to generate efficient cyclic encoding, for transmitting secrete quantum keys, for quantum state recovery and for error correction in quantum computing. Finite projective planes and their generalization are the geometric counterpart to cyclotomic concepts, their coordinatization involves Galois fields, and they have been used repetitively for enciphering and coding. Finally the characters over Galois fields are fundamental for generating complete sets of mutually unbiased bases, a generic concept of quantum information processing and quantum entanglement. Gauss sums over Galois fields ensure minimum uncertainty under such protocols. Some Galois rings which are cyclotomic extensions of the integers modulo 4 are also becoming fashionable for their role in time encoding and mutual unbiasedness.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum search algorithm consists of an alternating sequence of selective inversions and diffusion type operations, as a result of which it can find a target state in an unsorted database of size N in only sqrt(N) queries. This paper shows that by replacing the selective inversions by selective phase shifts of Pi/3, the algorithm gets transformed into something similar to a classical search algorithm. Just like classical search algorithms this algorithm has a fixed point in state-space toward which it preferentially converges. In contrast, the original quantum search algorithm moves uniformly in a two-dimensional state space. This feature leads to robust search algorithms and also to conceptually new schemes for error correction.

<blockquote>
<p>
Both in classical and quantum stochastic control theory a major role is played by the filtering equation, which recursively updates the information state of the system under observation. Unfortunately, the theory is plagued by infinite-dimensionality of the information state which severely limits its practical applicability, except in a few select cases (e.g. the linear Gaussian case.) One solution proposed in classical filtering theory is that of the projection filter. In this scheme, the filter is constrained to evolve in a finite-dimensional family of densities through orthogonal projection on the tangent space with respect to the Fisher metric. Here we apply this approach to the simple but highly nonlinear quantum model of optical phase bistability of a stongly coupled two-level atom in an optical cavity. We observe near-optimal performance of the quantum projection filter, demonstrating the utility of such an approach.

<blockquote>
<p>
Modern classical computing devices, except of simplest calculators, have von Neumann architecture, i.e., a part of the memory is used for the program and a part for the data. It is likely, that analogues of such architecture are also desirable for the future applications in quantum computing, communications and control. It is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the quantum information science and raises challenging questions about an experimental assessment of such a programmable models. Together with some progress in the given direction, such ideas encounter specific problems arising from the very essence of quantum laws. Currently are known two different ways to overcome such problems, sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic approach. The presented paper is devoted to the second one, that is also may be called the programmable quantum networks with pure states. In the paper are discussed basic principles and theoretical models that can be used for the design of such nano-devices, e.g., the conditional quantum dynamics, the Nielsen-Chuang &quot;no-programming theorem, the idea of deterministic and stochastic quantum gates arrays. Both programmable quantum networks with finite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are considered. As a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network with pure states and finite program register is chosen a &quot;Control-Shift&quot; quantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works. It is shown also, that quantum cellular automata approach to the construction of an universal programmable quantum computer often may be considered as the particular case of such design.

<p>
A short introduction to quantum error correction is given, and it is shown that zero-dimensional quantum codes can be represented as self-dual additive codes over GF(4) and also as graphs. We show that graphs representing several such codes with high minimum distance can be described as nested regular graphs having minimum regular vertex degree and containing long cycles. Two graphs correspond to equivalent quantum codes if they are related by a sequence of local complementations. We use this operation to generate orbits of graphs, and thus classify all inequivalent self-dual additive codes over GF(4) of length up to 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We show that these codes can be interpreted as quadratic Boolean functions, and we define non-quadratic quantum codes, corresponding to Boolean functions of higher degree. We look at various cryptographic properties of Boolean functions, in particular the propagation criteria. The new aperiodic propagation criterion (APC) and the APC distance are then defined. We show that the distance of a zero-dimensional quantum code is equal to the APC distance of the corresponding Boolean function. Orbits of Boolean functions with respect to the {I,H,N}^n transform set are generated. We also study the peak-to-average power ratio with respect to the {I,H,N}^n transform set (PAR_IHN), and prove that PAR_IHN of a quadratic Boolean function is related to the size of the maximum independent set over the corresponding orbit of graphs. A construction technique for non-quadratic Boolean functions with low PAR_IHN is proposed. It is finally shown that both PAR_IHN and APC distance can be interpreted as partial entanglement measures.

<p><strong>25.    Fourier&#39;s Law confirmed for a class of small quantum systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Within the Lindblad formalism we consider an interacting spin chain coupled locally to heat baths. We investigate the dependence of the energy transport on the type of interaction in the system as well as on the overall interaction strength. For a large class of couplings we find a normal heat conduction and confirm Fourier&#39;s Law. In a fully quantum mechanical approach linear transport behavior appears to be generic even for small quantum systems.

<p><strong>26.    Quantum Mechanics without spacetime V - Why a quantum theory of gravity should be non-linear-</strong><br>
T.P.Singh, Sashideep Gutti, Rakesh Tibrewala<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0503116">http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0503116</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
If there exists a formulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer to a background classical spacetime manifold, it then follows as a consequence, (upon making one plausible assumption), that a quantum description of gravity should be necessarily non-linear. This is true independent of the mathematical structure used for describing such a formulation of quantum mechanics. A specific model which exhibits this non-linearity is constructed, using the language of noncommutative geometry. We derive a non-linear Schrodinger equation for the quantum dynamics of a particle; this equation reduces to the standard linear Schrodinger equation when the mass of the particle is much smaller than Planck mass. It turns out that the non-linear equation found by us is very similar to a non-linear Schrodinger equation found by Doebner and Goldin in 1992 from considerations of unitary representaions of the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis suggests that the diffusion constant introduced by Doebner and Goldin depends on the mass of the particle, and that this constant tends to zero in the limit in which the particle mass is much smaller than Planck mass, so that in this limit the non-linear theory reduces to standard linear quantum mechanics. A similar effective non-linear Schrodinger equation was also found for the quantum dynamics of a system of D0-branes, by Mavromatos and Szabo.
