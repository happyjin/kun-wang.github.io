    <p><strong>1.    Observation of quasiperiodic dynamics in a one-dimensional quantum walk of single photons in space</strong><br>
Peng Xue, Hao Qin, Bao Tang, Barry C. Sanders<br>
New J. Phys. 16 053009 (6 May 2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0123">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0123</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We realize quasi-periodic dynamics of a quantum walker over 2.5 quasi-periods by realizing the walker as a single photon passing through a quantum-walk optical-interferometer network. We introduce fully controllable polarization-independent phase shifters in each optical path to realize arbitrary site-dependent phase shifts, and we employ large clear-aperture beam displacers, while maintaining high-visibility interference, to enable reaching 10 quantum-walk steps. By varying the half-wave-plate setting, we control the quantum-coin bias thereby observing a transition from quasi-periodic dynamics to ballistic diffusion.

<p><strong>2.    Spatial Search on Grids with Minimum Memory</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum algorithms for spatial search on finite dimensional grids. Patel et al. and Falk have proposed algorithms based on a quantum walk without a coin, with different operators applied at even and odd steps. Until now, such algorithms have been studied only using numerical simulations. In this paper, we present the first rigorous analysis for an algorithm of this type, showing that the optimal number of steps is $O(\sqrt{N\log N})$ and the success probability is $O(1/\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices. This matches the performance achieved by algorithms that use other forms of quantum walks.

<p><strong>3.    Quantification and Control of non-Markovian Evolution in Finite Quantum Systems via Feedback</strong><br>
Nicholas Chancellor, Christoph Petri, Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Anthony F.J. Levi, Stephan Haas<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the unitary time evolution of continuous quantum mechanical systems confined to a cavity in contact with a finite bath of variable size. Measures for Markovianity for such finite system-bath configurations are developed in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt distances of time evolving wave packets. The relevant time scales are identified, which characterize pseudo-Markovian transient behavior, boundary scattering induced non-Markovian oscillations at intermediate times, and non-Markovian rephasing events at long time scales. It is shown how these time scales can be controlled by tunable parameters such as the bath size and the strength of the system-bath coupling.

<p><strong>4.    Global versus local optimality in feedback-controlled qubit purification: new insights from minimizing Rényi entropies</strong><br>
Colin Teo, Joshua Combes, Howard M. Wiseman<br>
New J. Phys. 16, 105010 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1015">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1015</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was first shown by Jacobs, in 2003, that the process of qubit state purification by continuous measurement of one observable can be enhanced, on average, by unitary feedback control. Here, we quantify this by the reduction in any one of the family of R\&#39;enyi entropies $S_\alpha$, with $0&lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$, at some terminal time, revealing the rich structure of stochastic quantum control even for this simple problem. We generalize Jacobs&#39; original argument, which was for (the unique) impurity measure with a linear evolution map under his protocol, by replacing linearity with convexity, thereby making it applicable to R\&#39;enyi entropies $S_\alpha$ for $\alpha$ in a finite interval about $1$. Even with this generalization, Jacobs&#39; argument fails to identify the surprising fact, which we prove by Bellman&#39;s principle of dynamic programming, that his protocol is globally optimal for all R\&#39;enyi entropies whose decrease is locally maximized by that protocol. Also surprisingly, even though there is a range of R\&#39;enyi entropies whose decrease is always locally maximized by the null-control protocol, that null-control protocol cannot be shown to be globally optimal in any instance. These results highlight the non-intuitive relation between local and global optimality in stochastic quantum control.

<blockquote>
<p>
Photonic nanostructures provide means of tailoring the interaction between light and matter and the past decade has witnessed a tremendous experimental and theoretical progress in this subject. In particular, the combination with semiconductor quantum dots has proven successful. This manuscript reviews quantum optics with excitons in single quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures. The ability to engineer the light-matter interaction strength in integrated photonic nanostructures enables a range of fundamental quantum-electrodynamics experiments on, e.g., spontaneous-emission control, modified Lamb shifts, and enhanced dipole-dipole interaction. Furthermore, highly efficient single-photon sources and giant photon nonlinearities may be implemented with immediate applications for photonic quantum-information processing. The review summarizes the general theoretical framework of photon emission including the role of dephasing processes, and applies it to photonic nanostructures of current interest, such as photonic-crystal cavities and waveguides, dielectric nanowires, and plasmonic waveguides. The introduced concepts are generally applicable in quantum nanophotonics and apply to a large extent also to other quantum emitters, such as molecules, nitrogen vacancy ceters, or atoms. Finally, the progress and future prospects of applications in quantum-information processing are considered.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum Error Correction During 50 Gates</strong><br>
Yaakov S. Weinstein<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1245">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1245</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fault tolerant protocol assumes the application of error correction after every quantum gate. However, correcting errors is costly in terms of time and number of qubits. Here we demonstrate that quantum error correction can be applied significantly less often with only a minimal loss of fidelity. This is done by simulating the implementation of 50 encoded, single-qubit, quantum gates within the [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code in a noisy, non-equiprobable Pauli error environment with error correction being applied at different intervals. We find that applying error correction after every gate is rarely optimal and even applying error correction only once after all 50 gates, though not generally optimal, sacrifices only a slight amount of fidelity with the benefit of 50-fold saving of resources. In addition, we find that in cases where bit-flip errors are dominant, it is best not to apply error correction at all.

<p><strong>7.    Quantifying quantumness via commutators: an application to quantum walk</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1329">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1329</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The question of witnessing or quantifying nonclassicality of quantum systems has been addressed in various ways. For a given system or theory, we propose identifying it with the incompatibility of admissible states. We quantify the nonclassicality of quantum systems using the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the commutator of two states. As a particular application of this measure, we study the classicalization of a discrete-time quantum walk with a noisy coin.

<p><strong>8.    Exponential improvement in precision for simulating sparse Hamiltonians</strong><br>
Dominic W. Berry, Andrew M. Childs, Richard Cleve, Robin Kothari, Rolando D. Somma<br>
Proceedings of the 46th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2014), pp. 283-292 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1414">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1414</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of sparse Hamiltonians with complexity sublogarithmic in the inverse error, an exponential improvement over previous methods. Specifically, we show that a $d$-sparse Hamiltonian $H$ acting on $n$ qubits can be simulated for time $t$ with precision $\epsilon$ using $O\big(\tau \frac{\log(\tau/\epsilon)}{\log\log(\tau/\epsilon)}\big)$ queries and $O\big(\tau \frac{\log^2(\tau/\epsilon)}{\log\log(\tau/\epsilon)}n\big)$ additional 2-qubit gates, where $\tau = d^2 |{H}|_{\max} t$. Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of &quot;oblivious amplitude amplification&quot; that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1832">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1832</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Transport properties play a crucial role in several fields of science, as biology, chemistry, sociology, information science, and physics. The behavior of many dynamical processes running over complex networks is known to be closely related to the geometry of the underlying topology, but this connection becomes even harder to understand when quantum effects come into play. Here, we exploit the Kossakoski-Lindblad formalism of quantum stochastic walks to investigate the capability to quickly and robustly transmit energy (or information) between two distant points in very large complex structures, remarkably assisted by external noise and quantum features as coherence. An optimal mixing of classical and quantum transport is, very surprisingly, quite universal for a large class of complex networks. This widespread behaviour turns out to be also extremely robust with respect to geometry changes. These results might pave the way for designing optimal bio-inspired geometries of efficient transport nanostructures that can be used for solar energy and also quantum information and communication technologies.

<p><strong>11.    Comparing the Overhead of Topological and Concatenated Quantum Error Correction</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2316">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2316</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This work compares the overhead of quantum error correction with concatenated and topological quantum error-correcting codes. To perform a numerical analysis, we use the Quantum Resource Estimator Toolbox (QuRE) that we recently developed. We use QuRE to estimate the number of qubits, quantum gates, and amount of time needed to factor a 1024-bit number on several candidate quantum technologies that differ in their clock speed and reliability. We make several interesting observations. First, topological quantum error correction requires fewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated codes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately 10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be chosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and superconducting qubits. Second, we observe that the composition of the elementary gate types occurring in a typical logical circuit, a fault-tolerant circuit protected by the surface code, and a fault-tolerant circuit protected by a concatenated code all differ. This also suggests that choosing the most appropriate error correction technique depends on the ability of the future technology to perform specific gates efficiently.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a quantum emitter (&quot;atom&quot;) radiating in a one-dimensional (1D) photonic waveguide in the presence of a single mirror, resulting in a delay differential equation for the atomic amplitude. We carry out a systematic analysis of the non-Markovian (NM) character of the atomic dynamics in terms of refined, recently developed notions of quantum non-Markovianity such as indivisibility and information back-flow. NM effects are quantified as a function of the round-trip time and phase shift associated with the atom-mirror optical path. We find, in particular, that unless an atom-photon bound state is formed a finite time delay is always required in order for NM effects to be exhibited. This identifies a finite threshold in the parameter space, which separates the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a generalization of recently proposed non-Hermitian model for resonant cavities coupled by a chiral mirror by taking into account number non-conservation and nonlinear interactions. We analyze non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of populations and entanglement of the cavity modes. We find that an interplay of initial coherence and non-Hermitian coupling leads to a counterintuitive population transfer. While an initially coherent cavity mode is depleted, the other empty cavity can be populated more or less than the initially filled one. Moreover, presence of nonlinearity yields population collapse and revival as well as bipartite entanglement of the cavity modes. In addition to coupled cavities, we point out that similar models can be found in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Bose-Hubbard dimers of Bose-Einstein condensates or in coupled soliton-plasmon waveguides. We specifically illustrate quantum dynamics of populations and entanglement in a heuristic model that we propose for a soliton-plasmon system with soliton amplitude dependent asymmetric interaction. Degree of asymmetry, nonlinearity and coherence are examined to control plasmon excitations and soliton-plasmon entanglement. Relations to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric lasers and Jahn-Teller systems are pointed out.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum optics plays a central role in the study of fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, and in the development of new technological applications. Typical experiments employ non-classical light, such as entangled photons, generated by parametric processes. The standard characterization of the sources by quantum tomography, which relies on detecting the pairs themselves and thus requires single photon detectors, limits both measurement speed and accuracy. Here we show that the spectral characterization of the quantum correlations generated by two-photon sources can be directly performed classically with an unprecedented spectral resolution. This streamlined technique has the potential to speed up design and testing of massively parallel integrated sources by providing a fast and reliable quality control procedure. Adapting our method to explore other degrees of freedom would allow the complete characterization of biphoton states generated by parametric processes.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate experimentally a scheme to measure small temporal delays, much smaller than the pulse width, between optical pulses. Specifically, we observe an interference effect, based on the concepts of quantum weak measurements and weak value amplification, through which a sub-pulsewidth temporal delay between two femtosecond pulses induces a measurable shift of the central frequency of the pulse. The amount of frequency shift, and the accompanying losses of the measurement, can be tailored by post-selecting different states of polarization. Our scheme requires only spectrum measurements and linear optics elements, hence greatly facilitating its implementation. Thus it appears as a promising technique for measuring small and rapidly varying temporal delays.

We introduce a new class of circuits for constructing efficiently decodable error-correction codes, based on a recently discovered contractible tensor network. We perform an in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as an extension to Arikan&#39;s polar code. Notably, our numerical simulation show that this code polarizes the logical channels more strongly while retaining the log-linear decoding complexity using the successive cancellation decoder. These codes also display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity. Efficient decoding is realized using powerful graphical calculus tools developed in the field of quantum many-body physics. In a companion paper, we generalize our construction to the quantum setting and describe more in-depth the relation between classical and quantum error correction and the graphical calculus of tensor networks.

<blockquote>
<p>
Electrons have an intrinsic, indivisible, magnetic dipole aligned with their internal angular momentum (spin). The magnetic interaction between two electrons can therefore impose a change in their spin orientation. This process, however, was never observed in experiment. The challenge is two-fold. At the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, the magnetic interaction is often overshadowed by the much larger coulomb exchange counterpart. In typical situations where exchange is negligible, magnetic interactions are also very weak and well below ambient magnetic noise. Here we report on the first measurement of the magnetic interaction between two electronic spins. To this end, we used the ground state valence electrons of two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, co-trapped in an electric Paul trap and separated by more than two micrometers. We measured the weak, millihertz scale (alternatively $10^{-18}$ eV or $10^{-14}$ K), magnetic interaction between their electronic spins. This, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six orders of magnitude larger than the respective magnetic fields the electrons apply on each other. Cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 s during which spin-entanglement was generated. The sensitivity necessary for this measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) which is immune to collective magnetic field noise. Finally, by varying the separation between the two ions, we were able to recover the inverse cubic distance dependence of the interaction. The reported method suggests an alternative route to the search of long-range anomalous spin-spin forces and can be generalized to include Quantum Error Correction codes for other cases of extremely weak signal detection.

<blockquote>
<p>
To date, a great deal of attention has focused on characterizing the performance of quantum error correcting codes via their thresholds, the maximum correctable physical error rate for a given noise model and decoding strategy. Practical quantum computers will necessarily operate below these thresholds meaning that other performance indicators become important. In this work we consider the scaling of the logical error rate of the toric code and demonstrate how, in turn, this may be used to calculate a key performance indicator. We use a perfect matching decoding algorithm to find the scaling of the logical error rate and find two distinct operating regimes. The first regime admits a universal scaling analysis due to a mapping to a statistical physics model. The second regime characterizes the behavior in the limit of small physical error rate and can be understood by counting the error configurations leading to the failure of the decoder. We present a conjecture for the ranges of validity of these two regimes and use them to quantify the overhead -- the total number of physical qubits required to perform error correction.

The strong atom- field interaction makes the cavity transmission depend on the time dependent atomic state, and we present a Hidden Markov Model description of the atomic state dynamics which is conditioned in a Bayesian manner on the detected signal. We suggest that small variations in the observed signal may be due to spatial motion of the atom within the cavity, and we represent the atomic system by a number of hidden states to account for both the small variations and the internal state jump dynamics. In our theory, the atomic state is determined in a Bayesian manner from the measurement data, and we present an iterative protocol, which determines both the atomic state and the model parameters. As a new element in the treatment of observed quantum systems, we employ a Bayesian approach that conditions the atomic state at time t on the data acquired both before and after t and we show that the state assignment by this approach is more decisive than the usual conditional quantum states, based on only earlier measurement data.

<p><strong>25.    Asymmetric random walks in a discrete spacetime as a model for quantum mechanics</strong><br>
Antonio Sciarretta<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5977">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5977</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper presents a simple model that mimics quantum mechanics (QM) results in terms of probability fields of free particles subject to self-interference, without using Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation or wavefunctions. Unlike the standard QM picture, the proposed model only uses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic operations. In particular, it assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of an euclidean lattice. The proposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks. Transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation, or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk. Non-relativistic QM predictions, particularly self-interference, are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly-prepared ensembles of particles. Extension to interacting particles is discussed but not detailed in this paper.

The theory of general relativity describes macroscopic phenomena driven by the influence of gravity while quantum mechanics brilliantly accounts for microscopic effects. Despite their tremendous individual success, a complete unification of fundamental interactions is missing and remains one of the most challenging and important quests in modern theoretical physics. The STE-QUEST satellite mission, proposed as a medium-size mission within the Cosmic Vision program of the European Space Agency (ESA), aims for testing general relativity with high precision in two experiments by performing a measurement of the gravitational redshift of the Sun and the Moon by comparing terrestrial clocks, and by performing a test of the Universality of Free Fall of matter waves in the gravitational field of Earth comparing the trajectory of two Bose-Einstein condensates of Rb85 and Rb87. The two ultracold atom clouds are monitored very precisely thanks to techniques of atom interferometry. This allows to reach down to an uncertainty in the E\&quot;otv\&quot;os parameter of at least 2x10E-15. In this paper, we report about the results of the phase A mission study of the atom interferometer instrument covering the description of the main payload elements, the atomic source concept, and the systematic error sources.

<p>
One of the main challenges for future quantum information technologies is miniaturization and integration of high performance components in a single chip. In this context, electrically driven sources of non-classical states of light have a clear advantage over optically driven ones. Here we demonstrate the first electrically driven semiconductor source of photon pairs working at room temperature and telecom wavelength. The device is based on type-II intracavity Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in an AlGaAs laser diode and generates pairs at 1.57 $\mu$m. Time-correlation measurements of the emitted pairs give an internal generation efficiency of $7 \times 10^{-11}$ pairs/injected electron. The capability of our platform to support generation, manipulation and detection of photons opens the way to the demonstration of massively parallel systems for complex quantum operations.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the states generated in continuous variable (CV) optical fields on operating it with a number-conserving operator formed by the generalized superposition of products of field annihilation ($\hat{a}$) and creation ($\hat{a}^\dag$) operators, of the type $s\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dag + t\hat{a}^\dag\hat{a}$, with $s^2+t^2=1$. Such an operator is experimentally realizable and can be suitably manipulated to generate nonclassicality. We generate mode-entangled discrete bipartite states at low field intensities by applying the operation on single- and two-mode coherent, thermal and squeezed input states, and convert the nonclassicality into bipartite entanglement between the modes using a linear optical device. These operated nonclassical two-mode states can be used as quantum channels in CV quantum teleportation of single-mode coherent and squeezed states. The success of the teleportation under Braunstein and Kimble protocol is measured using the average fidelity of teleportation. We show that the operation reduces classical fidelity while enhancing quantum fidelity of CV teleportation in the sense that the teleportation fidelity of highly Einstein-Podolosky-Rosen (EPR) correlated two-mode squeezed states gets enhanced and those of the EPR non-correlated thermal and coherent channels get reduced. This investigation could prove useful in efficient implementation of noisy non-Gaussian channels, formed by linear operations, in future teleportation protocols.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate theoretically quantum effects of a cavity-atom system in which the upper two levels of a cascade-type three-level atom interact with a cavity field mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime. By exploiting the virtual photons carried by atom-cavity dressed states, we indicate how two external driving fields induce Raman transitions such that a continuous conversion of virtual photons into real photons can be achieved with a high probability. We present analytical and numerical solutions of the system. In addition, we show that the converted photons exhibit a bunching behavior in the steady state. Our scheme demonstrates that atom-cavity dressed states in the ultrastrong coupling regime can serve as intermediate states to invoke nonlinear optical processes.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the query complexity of Weak Parity: the problem of computing the parity of an n-bit input string, where one only has to succeed on a 1/2+eps fraction of input strings, but must do so with high probability on those inputs where one does succeed. It is well-known that n randomized queries and n/2 quantum queries are needed to compute parity on all inputs. But surprisingly, we give a randomized algorithm for Weak Parity that makes only O(n/log^0.246(1/eps)) queries, as well as a quantum algorithm that makes only O(n/sqrt(log(1/eps))) queries. We also prove a lower bound of Omega(n/log(1/eps)) in both cases; and using extremal combinatorics, prove lower bounds of Omega(log n) in the randomized case and Omega(sqrt(log n)) in the quantum case for any eps&gt;0. We show that improving our lower bounds is intimately related to two longstanding open problems about Boolean functions: the Sensitivity Conjecture, and the relationships between query complexity and polynomial degree.

In this paper, we consider the time averaged distribution of discrete time quantum walks on the glued trees. In order to analyse the walks on the glued trees, we consider a reduction to the walks on path graphs. Using a spectral analysis of the Jacobi matrices defined by the corresponding random walks on the path graphs, we have spectral decomposition of the time evolution operator of the quantum walks. We find significant contributions of the eigenvalues $\pm 1$ of the Jacobi matrices to the time averaged limit distribution of the quantum walks. As a consequence we obtain lower bounds of the time averaged distribution.

Using quantum parallelism on random walks as original seed, we introduce new quantum stochastic processes, the open quantum Brownian motions. They describe the behaviors of quantum walkers -- with internal degrees of freedom which serve as random gyroscopes -- interacting with series of probes. These processes may also be viewed as the scaling limit of open quantum random walks and we develop this approach along three different lines: quantum trajectory, quantum dynamical map, and quantum stochastic differential equation. We also present a study of the simplest case, with a two level system as internal gyroscope, illustrating the interplay between ballistic and diffusive behaviors at work in these processes.

<p>
Atomic and molecular samples reduced to temperatures below 1 microkelvin, yet still in the gas phase, afford unprecedented energy resolution in probing and manipulating how their constituent particles interact with one another. For simple atoms, such as alkalis, scattering resonances are extremely well-characterized. However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new regime, where far more complex species can be cooled and studied, including magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been speculated that a dense forest of resonances in ultracold collision cross sections will likely express essentially random fluctuations, much as the observed energy spectra of nuclear scattering do. According to the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, these fluctuations would imply chaotic dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would provide a paradigm shift in ultracold atomic and molecular physics, necessitating new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions of atoms in this regime, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter. In this report we provide the first experimental demonstration that random spectra are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas of erbium atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, for bosons on the order of 3 per gauss. Analysis of their statistics verifies that their distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings is what one would expect from random matrix theory. The density and statistics of these resonances are explained by fully-quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in the anisotropy of the atoms&#39; potential energy surface. Our results therefore reveal for the first time chaotic behavior in the native interaction between ultracold atoms.

<blockquote>
<p>
The single particle tunneling in a vertical stack consisting of monolayers of two-dimensional semiconductors is studied theoretically and its application to a novel Two-dimensional Heterojunction Interlayer Tunneling Field Effect Transistor (Thin-TFET) is proposed and described. The tunneling current is calculated by using a formalism based on the Bardeen&#39;s transfer Hamiltonian, and including a semi-classical treatment of scattering and energy broadening effects. The misalignment between the two 2D materials is also studied and found to influence the magnitude of the tunneling current, but have a modest impact on its gate voltage dependence. Our simulation results suggest that the Thin-TFETs can achieve very steep subthreshold swing, whose lower limit is ultimately set by the band tails in the energy gaps of the 2D materials produced by energy broadening. The Thin-TFET is thus very promising as a low voltage, low energy solid state electronic switch.

The integration of nanophotonics and atomic physics has been a long-sought goal that would open new frontiers for optical physics. Here, we report the development of the first integrated optical circuit with a photonic crystal capable of both localizing and interfacing atoms with guided photons in the device. By aligning the optical bands of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) with selected atomic transitions, our platform provides new opportunities for novel quantum transport and many-body phenomena by way of photon-mediated atomic interactions along the PCW. From reflection spectra measured with average atom number N = 1.1$\pm$0.4, we infer that atoms are localized within the PCW by Casimir-Polder and optical dipole forces. The fraction of single-atom radiative decay into the PCW is $\Gamma_{\rm 1D}/\Gamma&#39;$ = 0.32$\pm$0.08, where $\Gamma_{1D}$ is the rate of emission into the guided mode and $\Gamma&#39;$ is the decay rate into all other channels. $\Gamma_{\rm 1D}/\Gamma&#39;$ is quoted without enhancement due to an external cavity and is unprecedented in all current atom-photon interfaces.

<p>
We study a particular class of complex-valued random variables and their associated random walks: the complex obtuse random variables. They are the generalization to the complex case of the real-valued obtuse random variables which were introduced in \cite{A-E} in order to understand the structure of normal martingales in $\RR^n$.The extension to the complex case is mainly motivated by considerations from Quantum Statistical Mechanics, in particular for the seek of a characterization of those quantum baths acting as classical noises. The extension of obtuse random variables to the complex case is far from obvious and hides very interesting algebraical structures. We show that complex obtuse random variables are characterized by a 3-tensor which admits certain symmetries which we show to be the exact 3-tensor analogue of the normal character for 2-tensors (i.e. matrices), that is, a necessary and sufficient condition for being diagonalizable in some orthonormal basis. We discuss the passage to the continuous-time limit for these random walks and show that they converge in distribution to normal martingales in $\CC^N$. We show that the 3-tensor associated to these normal martingales encodes their behavior, in particular the diagonalization directions of the 3-tensor indicate the directions of the space where the martingale behaves like a diffusion and those where it behaves like a Poisson process. We finally prove the convergence, in the continuous-time limit, of the corresponding multiplication operators on the canonical Fock space, with an explicit expression in terms of the associated 3-tensor again.

We investigate temperature-dependent resonance fluorescence spectra obtained from a single self-assembled quantum dot. A decrease of the Mollow triplet sideband splitting is observed with increasing temperature, an effect we attribute to a phonon-induced renormalisation of the driven dot Rabi frequency. We also present first evidence for a non-perturbative regime of phonon coupling, in which the expected linear increase in sideband linewidth as a function of temperature is cancelled by the corresponding reduction in Rabi frequency. These results indicate that dephasing in semiconductor quantum dots may be less sensitive to changes in temperature than expected from a standard weak-coupling analysis of phonon effects.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general approach to rounding semidefinite programming relaxations obtained by the Sum-of-Squares method (Lasserre hierarchy). Our approach is based on using the connection between these relaxations and the Sum-of-Squares proof system to transform a <em>combining algorithm</em> -- an algorithm that maps a distribution over solutions into a (possibly weaker) solution -- into a <em>rounding algorithm</em> that maps a solution of the relaxation to a solution of the original problem. Using this approach, we obtain algorithms that yield improved results for natural variants of three well-known problems: 1) We give a quasipolynomial-time algorithm that approximates the maximum of a low degree multivariate polynomial with non-negative coefficients over the Euclidean unit sphere. Beyond being of interest in its own right, this is related to an open question in quantum information theory, and our techniques have already led to improved results in this area (Brand~{a}o and Harrow, STOC &#39;13). 2) We give a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a d dimensional subspace of R^n that (almost) contains the characteristic function of a set of size n/k, finds a vector $v$ in the subspace satisfying $|v|_4^4 &gt; c(k/d^{1/3}) |v|_2^2$, where $|v|_p = (E_i v_i^p)^{1/p}$. Aside from being a natural relaxation, this is also motivated by a connection to the Small Set Expansion problem shown by Barak et al. (STOC 2012) and our results yield a certain improvement for that problem. 3) We use this notion of L_4 vs. L_2 sparsity to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm with substantially improved guarantees for recovering a planted $\mu$-sparse vector v in a random d-dimensional subspace of R^n. If v has mu n nonzero coordinates, we can recover it with high probability whenever $\mu &lt; O(\min(1,n/d^2))$, improving for $d &lt; n^{2/3}$ prior methods which intrinsically required $\mu &lt; O(1/\sqrt(d))$.
