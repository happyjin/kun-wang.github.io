<p><strong>2.    Quantum Walk with a four-dimensional coin</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the physical implementation of a discrete time quantum walk with a four-dimensional coin. Our quantum walker is a photon moving repeatedly through a time delay loop, with time being our position space. The quantum coin is implemented using the internal states of the photon: the polarization and two of the orbital angular momentum states. We demonstrate how to implement this physically and what components would be needed. We then illustrate some of the results that could be obtained by performing the experiment.

<p><strong>3.    Complete hyperentangled-Bell-state analysis for quantum communication</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is impossible to unambiguously distinguish the four Bell states in polarization, resorting to linear optical elements only. Recently, the hyperentangled Bell state, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom, has been used to assist in the complete Bell-state analysis of the four Bell states. However, if the additional degree of freedom is qubitlike, one can only distinguish 7 from the group of 16 states. Here we present a way to distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states completely with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Also, we discuss its application in the quantum teleportation of a particle in an unknown state in two different degrees of freedom and in the entanglement swapping of hyperentangled states. These applications will increase the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication.

<p>
We present a quantum hyperdense coding protocol with hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom of photons first and then give the details for a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol based on this quantum hyperdense coding protocol. This QSDC protocol has the advantage of having a higher capacity than the quantum communication protocols with a qubit system. Compared with the QSDC protocol based on superdense coding with $d$-dimensional systems, this QSDC protocol is more feasible as the preparation of a high-dimension quantum system is more difficult than that of a two-level quantum system at present.

Integrated optics provides an ideal test bed for the emulation of quantum systems via continuous-time quantum walks. Here we study the evolution of two-photon states in an elliptic array of waveguides. We characterise the photonic chip via coherent-light tomography and use the results to predict distinct differences between temporally indistinguishable and distinguishable two-photon inputs which we then compare with experimental observations. Our work highlights the feasibility for emulation of coherent quantum phenomena in three-dimensional waveguide structures.

<p><strong>6.    Approximate simulation of quantum channels</strong><br>
Cédric Bény, Ognyan Oreshkov<br>
Phys. Rev. A 84, 022333 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0649">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0649</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In Ref. [1], we proved a duality between two optimizations problems. The primary one is, given two quantum channels M and N, to find a quantum channel R such that RN is optimally close to M as measured by the worst-case entanglement fidelity. The dual problem involves the information obtained by the environment through the so-called complementary channels M* and N*, and consists in finding a quantum channel R&#39; such that R&#39;M* is optimally close to N*. It turns out to be easier to find an approximate solution to the dual problem in certain important situations, notably when M is the identity channel---the problem of quantum error correction---yielding a good near-optimal worst-case entanglement fidelity as well as the corresponding near-optimal correcting channel. Here we provide more detailed proofs of these results. In addition, we generalize the main theorem to the case where there are certain constraints on the implementation of R, namely on the number of Kraus operators. We also offer a simple algebraic form for the near-optimal correction channel in the case M=id. For approximate error correction, we show that any epsilon-correctable channel is, up to appending an ancilla, epsilon-close to an exactly correctable one. We also demonstrate an application of our theorem to the problem of minimax state discrimination.

<p><strong>7.    Semigroup evolution in Wigner Weisskopf pole approximation with Markovian spectral coupling</strong><br>
F. Shikerman, A. Peer, L. P. Horwitz<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1150">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1150</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We establish the relation between the Wigner-Weisskopf theory for the description of an unstable system and the theory of coupling to an environment. According to the Wigner-Weisskopf general approach, even within the pole approximation (neglecting the background contribution) the evolution of a total system subspace is not an exact semigroup for the multi-channel decay, unless the projectors into eigesntates of the reduced evolution generator $W(z)$ are orthogonal. In this case these projectors must be evaluated at different pole locations $z_\alpha\neq z_\beta$. Since the orthogonality relation does not generally hold at different values of $z$, for example, when there is symmetry breaking, the semigroup evolution is a poor approximation for the multi-channel decay, even for a very weak coupling. Nevertheless, there exists a possibility not only to ensure the orthogonality of the $W(z)$ projectors regardless the number of the poles, but also to simultaneously suppress the effect of the background contribution. This possibility arises when the theory is generalized to take into account interactions with an environment. In this case $W(z)$, and hence its eigenvectors as well, are {\it independent} of $z$, which corresponds to a structure of the coupling to the continuum spectrum associated with the Markovian limit.

Alex W. Chin, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 233601 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1219">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1219</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze precision bounds for a local phase estimation in the presence of general, non-Markovian phase noise. We demonstrate that the metrological equivalence of product and maximally entangled states that holds under strictly Markovian dephasing fails in the non-Markovian case. Using an exactly solvable model of a physically realistic finite bandwidth dephasing environment, we demonstrate that the ensuing non-Markovian dynamics enables quantum correlated states to outperform metrological strategies based on uncorrelated states using otherwise identical resources. We show that this conclusion is a direct result of the coherent dynamics of the global state of the system and environment and therefore the obtained scaling with the number of particles, which surpasses the standard quantum limit but does not achieve Heisenberg resolution, possesses general validity that goes beyond specific models. This is in marked contrast with the situation encountered under general Markovian noise, where an arbitrarily small amount of noise is enough to restore the scaling dictated by the standard quantum limit.

<p>
Coherent feedback is a non-measurement based, hence a back-action free, method of control for quantum systems. A typical application of this control scheme is squeezing enhancement, a purely non-classical effect in quantum optics. In this paper we report its first experimental demonstration that well agrees with the theory taking into account time delays and losses in the coherent feedback loop. The results clarify both the benefit and the limitation of coherent feedback control in a practical situation.

<p><strong>14.    Non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time correlation functions of system operators: beyond the quantum regression theorem</strong><br>
Hsi-Sheng Goan, Po-Wen Chen, Chung-Chin Jian<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1502">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1502</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An extremely useful evolution equation that allows systematically calculating the two-time correlation functions (CF&#39;s) of system operators for non-Markovian open (dissipative) quantum systems is derived. The derivation is based on perturbative quantum master equation approach, so non-Markovian open quantum system models that are not exactly solvable can use our derived evolution equation to easily obtain their two-time CF&#39;s of system operators, valid to second order in the system-environment interaction. Since the form and nature of the Hamiltonian are not specified in our derived evolution equation, our evolution equation is applicable for bosonic and/or fermionic environments and can be applied to a wide range of system-environment models with any factorized (separable) system-environment initial states (pure or mixed). When applied to a general model of a system coupled to a finite-temperature bosonic environment with a system coupling operator L in the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian, the resultant evolution equation is valid for both L = L^+ and L \neq L^+ cases, in contrast to those evolution equations valid only for L = L^+ case in the literature. The derived equation that generalizes the quantum regression theorem (QRT) to the non-Markovian case will have broad applications in many different branches of physics. We then give conditions on which the QRT holds in the weak system-environment coupling case, and apply the derived evolution equation to a problem of a two-level system (atom) coupled to a finite-temperature bosonic environment (electromagnetic fields) with L \neq L^+.

<blockquote>
<p>
Any physical quantum device for quantum information processing is subject to errors in implementation. In order to be reliable and efficient, quantum computers will need error correcting or error avoiding methods. Fault-tolerance achieved through quantum error correction will be an integral part of quantum computers. Of the many methods that have been discovered to implement it, a highly successful approach has been to use transversal gates and specific initial states. A critical element for its implementation is the availability of high-fidelity initial states such as |0&gt; and the Magic State. Here we report an experiment, performed in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor, showing sufficient quantum control to improve the fidelity of imperfect initial magic states by distilling five of them into one with higher fidelity.

We present a new scheme for a discrete-time quantum walk on two- and three-dimensional lattices using a two-state particle.

Using this scheme, the probability distribution from Grover walk using four-state particle and other equivalent schemes on a square lattice using coin operation is reproduced. We also present the Hamiltonian form of evolution which can serve as a general framework to simulate, control, and study the dynamics in different physical systems.

<p><strong>17.    Quantum rejection sampling</strong><br>
Maris Ozols, Martin Roetteler, Jérémie Roland<br>
Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS&#39;12), ACM Press, 2012, pages 290-308<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2774">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2774</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rejection sampling is a well-known method to sample from a target distribution, given the ability to sample from a given distribution. The method has been first formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of this paper is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle which allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem. Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data. Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd. Secondly, we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al.. Finally, we derive a new quantum algorithm for the hidden shift problem of an arbitrary Boolean function and relate its query complexity to &quot;water-filling&quot; of the Fourier spectrum.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a reliable algorithm to evaluate quantum discord for general two--qubit states, amending and extending an approach recently put forward for the subclass of X--states. A closed expression for the discord of arbitrary states of two qubits cannot be obtained, as the optimization problem for the conditional entropy requires the solution to a pair of transcendental equations in the state parameters. We apply our algorithm to run a numerical comparison between quantum discord and an alternative, computable measure of non-classical correlations, namely the geometric discord. We identify the extremally non-classically correlated two--qubit states according to the (normalized) geometric discord, at fixed value of the conventional quantum discord. The latter cannot exceed the square root of the former for systems of two qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we investigate the generation of continuous variable entanglement between two spatially-separate nanocavities mediated by a coupled resonator optical waveguide in photonic crystals. By solving the exact dynamics of the cavity system coupled to the waveguide, the entanglement and purity of the two-mode cavity state are discussed in detail for the initially separated squeezing inputs. It is found that the stable and pure entangled state of the two distant nanocavities can be achieved with the requirement of only a weak cavity-waveguide coupling when the cavities are resonant with the band center of the waveguide. The strong couplings between the cavities and the waveguide lead to the entanglement sudden death and sudden birth. When the frequencies of the cavities lie outside the band of the waveguide, the waveguide-induced cross frequency shift between the cavities can optimize the achievable entanglement. It is also shown that the entanglement can be easily manipulated through the changes of the cavity frequencies within the waveguide band.

<p>
Methods to control errors will be essential for quantum information processing. It is widely believed that fault-tolerant quantum error correction is the leading contender to achieve this goal. Although the theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction is very well understood, experimental implementation has been lagging. We study the feasibility of implementing repeated rounds of quantum error correction with refreshed ancillas in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In particular we study the procedure proposed for extracting entropy that consists of two stages; an error correcting code optimized to function at finite temperature, and an implementation of heat-bath algorithmic cooling to refresh the ancilla qubits. Two algorithms are presented which implement this method, one for performing tests on 4 qubits, the other for practical implementation on 6 qubits. The effects of imperfect implementation are examined in both the error correction and refreshing stages.

<p><strong>26.    Universal topological phase of 2D stabilizer codes</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Two topological phases are equivalent if they are connected by a local unitary transformation. In this sense, classifying topological phases amounts to classifying long-range entanglement patterns. We show that all 2D topological stabilizer codes are equivalent to several copies of one universal phase: Kitaev&#39;s topological code. Error correction benefits from the corresponding local mappings.

<p><strong>27.    Quantum Modelling of Electro-Optic Modulators</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Many components that are employed in quantum information and communication systems are well known photonic devices encountered in standard optical fiber communication systems, such as optical beamsplitters, waveguide couplers and junctions, electro-optic modulators and optical fiber links. The use of these photonic devices is becoming increasingly important especially in the context of their possible integration either in a specifically designed system or in an already deployed end-to-end fiber link. Whereas the behavior of these devices is well known under the classical regime, in some cases their operation under quantum conditions is less well understood. This paper reviews the salient features of the quantum scattering theory describing both the operation of the electro-optic phase and amplitude modulators in discrete and continuous-mode formalisms. This subject is timely and of importance in light of the increasing utilization of these devices in a variety of systems, including quantum key distribution and single-photon wavepacket measurement and conformation. In addition, the paper includes a tutorial development of the use of these models in selected but yet important applications, such as single and multi-tone modulation of photons, two-photon interference with phase-modulated light or the description of amplitude modulation as a quantum operation.

<p><strong>28.    Topological phases and delocalization of quantum walks in random environments</strong><br>
Hideaki Obuse, Norio Kawakami<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5545">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5545</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate one-dimensional (1D) discrete time quantum walks (QWs) with spatially or temporally random defects as a consequence of interactions with random environments. We focus on the QWs with chiral symmetry in a topological phase, and reveal that chiral symmetry together with bipartite nature of the QWs brings about intriguing behaviors such as coexistence of topologically protected edge states at zero energy and Anderson transitions in the 1D chiral class at non-zero energy in their dynamics. Contrary to the previous studies, therefore, the spatially disordered QWs can avoid complete localization due to the Anderson transition. It is further confirmed that the edge states are robust for spatial disorder but not for temporal disorder.

<blockquote>
<p>
The most efficient modern optical communication is known as coherent communication and its standard quantum limit (SQL) is almost reachable with current technology. Though it has been predicted for a long time that this SQL could be overcome via quantum mechanically optimized receivers, such a performance has not been experimentally realized so far. Here we demonstrate the first unconditional evidence surpassing the SQL of coherent optical communication. We implement a quantum receiver with a simple linear optics configuration and achieve more than 90% of the total detection efficiency of the system. Such an efficient quantum receiver will provide a new way of extending the distance of amplification-free channels, as well as of realizing quantum information protocols based on coherent states and the loophole-free test of quantum mechanics.

<blockquote>
<p>
Wave propagation in disordered media can be strongly modified by multiple scattering and wave interference. Ultimately the so-called Anderson-localized regime is reached when the waves become strongly confined in space. So far, Anderson localization of light has been probed in transmission experiments by measuring the intensity of an external light source after propagation through a disordered medium. However, discriminating between Anderson localization and losses in these experiments remains a major challenge. Here we present an alternative approach where we use quantum emitters embedded in disordered photonic crystal waveguides as light sources. Anderson-localized modes are efficiently excited and the analysis of the photoluminescence spectra allows to explore their statistical properties paving a way for controlling Anderson localization in disordered photonic crystals.

<blockquote>
<p>
Multimode nonclassical states of light are an essential resource in quantum computation with continuous variables, for example in cluster state computation. They can be generated either by mixing different squeezed light sources using linear optical operations, or directly in a multimode optical device. In parallel, frequency combs are perfect tools for high precision metrological applications and for quantum time transfer. Synchronously Pumped Optical Parametric Oscillators (SPOPOs) have been theoretically shown to produce multimode non-classical frequency combs. In this paper, we present the first experimental generation and characterization of a femtosecond quantum frequency comb generated by a SPOPO. In particular, we give the experimental evidence of the multimode nature of the generated quantum state and, by studying the spectral noise distribution of this state, we show that at least three nonclassical independent modes are required to describe it.

We consider two graph invariants inspired by quantum walks- one in continuous time and one in discrete time. We will associate a matrix algebra called a cellular algebra with every graph. We show that, if the cellular algebras of two graphs have a similar structure, then they are not distinguished by either of the proposed invariants.

<blockquote>
<p>
Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a periodic lattice of Josephson junctions can be driven by tunneling rate increase. Resulting winding numbers $W$ of the condensate wavefunction decrease with increasing quench time in accord with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, in very slow quenches Bose-Hubbard dynamics rearranges wavefunction phase so that its random walk cools, $\bar{W^2}$ decreases and eventually the wavefunction becomes too cold to overcome potential barriers separating different $W$. Thus, in contrast with KZM, in very slow quenches $\bar{W^2}$ is set by random walk with &quot;critical&quot; step size, independently of $\tau_Q$.

We report strong coupling between an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins in diamond and a superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonator. The characteristic scaling of the collective coupling strength with the square root of the number of emitters is observed directly. Additionally, we measure hyperfine coupling to 13C nuclear spins, which is a first step towards a nuclear ensemble quantum memory. Using the dispersive shift of the cavity resonance frequency, we measure the relaxation time T1 of the NV center at millikelvin temperatures in a non-destructive way.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the single-particle time evolution and two-particle quantum correlations in a one-dimensional $N$-site lattice with a site-dependent nearest neighbor tunneling function $t_\alpha(k)=t_0[k(N-k)]^{\alpha/2}$. Since the bandwidth and the energy levels spacings for such a lattice both depend upon $\alpha$, we show that the observable properties of a wavepacket, such as its spread and the relative phases of its constitutents, vary dramatically as $\alpha$ is varied from positive to negative values. We also find that the quantum correlations are exquisitely sensitive to the form of the tunneling function. Our results suggest that arrays of waveguides with position-dependent evanascent couplings will show rich dynamics with no counterpart in present-day, traditional systems.

We prove an analog of Levinson&#39;s theorem for scattering on a weighted (m+1)-vertex graph with a semi-infinite path attached to one of its vertices.

<p><strong>37.    Average mixing of continuous quantum walks</strong><br>
Chris Godsil<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2578">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2578</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
If $X$ is a graph with adjacency matrix $A$, then we define $H(t)$ to be the operator $\exp(itA)$. The Schur (or entrywise) product $H(t)\circ H(-t)$ is a doubly stochastic matrix and, because of work related to quantum computing, we are concerned the \textsl{average mixing matrix}. This can be defined as the limit of $C^{-1} \int_0^C H(t)\circ H(-t)\dt$ as $C\to\infty$. We establish some of the basic properties of this matrix, showing that it is positive semidefinite and that its entries are always rational. We find that for paths and cycles this matrix takes on a surprisingly simple form, thus for the path it is a linear combination of $I$, $J$ (the all-ones matrix), and a permutation matrix.
