    <p><strong>1.    Non-Markovian Analysis of the Phase Damped Jaynes-Cummings Model in the Presence of a Classical Homogeneous Gravitational Field</strong><br>
M.Mohammadi<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, the non-Markovian dissipative dynamics of the phase damped Jaynes-Cummings model in the presence of a classical homogeneous gravitational field will be analyzed. The model consists of a moving two-level atom simultaneously exposed to the gravitational field and a single-mode traveling radiation field in the presence of a non-Markovian phase damping mechanism. First, the non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density operator of the system in terms of a Hamiltonian describing the atom-field interaction in the presence of a homogeneous gravitational field will be presented. Then, the super-operator technique will be generalized and an exact solution of the non-Markovian master equation will be obtained. Assuming that initially the radiation field is prepared in a Glauber coherent state and the two-level atom is in the excited state, the non-Markovian effects on the temporal evolution of collapses and revivals of the atomic population inversion and photon counting statistics of the radiation field in the presence of both the phase damping and a homogeneous gravitational field will be investigated.

<p>
The Quantum Private Query is a quantum cryptographic protocol to recover information from a database, preserving both user and data privacy: the user can test whether someone has retained information on which query was asked, and the database provider can test the quantity of information released. Here we introduce a new variant Quantum Private Query algorithm which admits a simple linear optical implementation: it employs the photon&#39;s momentum (or time slot) as address qubits and its polarization as bus qubit. A proof-of-principle experimental realization is implemented.

<p><strong>3.    Abstract Error Groups Via Jones Unitary Braid Group Representations at q=i</strong><br>
Yong Zhang<br>
Quant. Inform. Proc.: Vol. 8, Issue 1 (2009) 25-36<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0383">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0383</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we classify a type of abstract groups by the central products of dihedral groups and quaternion groups. We recognize them as abstract error groups which are often not isomorphic to the Pauli groups in the literature. We show the corresponding nice error bases equivalent to the Pauli error bases modulo phase factors. The extension of these abstract groups by the symmetric group are finite images of the Jones unitary representations (or modulo a phase factor) of the braid group at q=i or r=4. We hope this work can finally lead to new families of quantum error correction codes via the representation theory of the braid group.

<blockquote>
<p>
The very small size of optical nonlinearities places wide ranging restrictions on the types of novel physics one can explore. For an ensemble of multi-level systems one can synthesize a large effective optical nonlinearity using quantum coherence effects but such non-linearities are technically extremely challenging to demonstrate at the single atom level. In this work we describe how a single artificial multi-level Cooper Pair Box molecule, interacting with a superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonator, when suitably driven, can generate extremely large optical nonlinearities at microwave frequencies, with no associated absorption. We describe how the giant self-Kerr effect can be detected by measuring the second-order correlation function and quadrature squeezing spectrum.

<p><strong>5.    Simulation of static and random errors on Grover&#39;s search algorithm implemented in a Ising nuclear spin chain quantum computer with few qubits</strong><br>
T. Gorin, L. Lara, G. V. Lopez<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0471">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0471</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider Grover&#39;s search algorithm on a model quantum computer implemented on a chain of four or five nuclear spins with first and second neighbour Ising interactions. Noise is introduced into the system in terms of random fluctuations of the external fields. By averaging over many repetitions of the algorithm, the output state becomes effectively a mixed state. We study its overlap with the nominal output state of the algorithm, which is called fidelity. We find either an exponential or a Gaussian decay for the fidelity as a function of the strength of the noise, depending on the type of noise (static or random) and whether error supression is applied (the 2pi k-method) or not.

<p><strong>6.    Qcmpi: A Parallel Environment for Quantum Computing</strong><br>

Computer Physics Communications 180 (2009) 948<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0699">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0699</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
QCMPI is a quantum computer (QC) simulation package written in Fortran 90 with parallel processing capabilities. It is an accessible research tool that permits rapid evaluation of quantum algorithms for a large number of qubits and for various &quot;noise&quot; scenarios. The prime motivation for developing QCMPI is to facilitate numerical examination of not only how QC algorithms work, but also to include noise, decoherence, and attenuation effects and to evaluate the efficacy of error correction schemes. The present work builds on an earlier Mathematica code QDENSITY, which is mainly a pedagogic tool. In QCMPI, the stress is on state vectors, in order to employ a large number of qubits. The parallel processing feature is implemented by using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. Codes for Grover&#39;s search and Shor&#39;s factoring algorithms are provided as examples. A major feature of this work is that concurrent versions of the algorithms can be evaluated with each version subject to alternate noise effects, which corresponds to the idea of solving a stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation.

<blockquote>
<p>
Placing a quantum dot close to a metal nanowire leads to drastic changes in its radiative decay behavior because of evanescent couplings to surface plasmons. We show how two non-Markovian effects, band-edge and retardation, could be observed in such a system. Combined with a quantum dot p-i-n junction, these effects could be readout via current-noise measurements. We also discuss how these effects can occur in similar systems with restricted geometries, like phononic cavities and photonic crystal waveguides. This work links two previously separate topics: surface-plasmons and current-noise measurements.

<blockquote>
<p>
The propagation of transverse spatial correlations of photon pairs through arbitrary first-order linear optical systems is studied experimentally and theoretically using the fractional Fourier transform. Highly-correlated photon pairs in an EPR-like state are produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and subject to optical fractional Fourier transform systems. It is shown that the joint detection probability can display either correlation, anti-correlation, or no correlation, depending on the sum of the orders $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the transforms of the down-converted photons. We present analytical results for the propagation of the perfectly correlated EPR state, and numerical results for the propagation of the two-photon state produced from parametric down-conversion. We find good agreement between theory and experiment.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1686">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1686</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Trapped ions offer long internal state (spin) coherence times and strong inter-particle interactions mediated by the Coulomb force. This makes them interesting candidates for quantum simulation of coupled lattices. To this end it is desirable to be able to trap ions in arbitrary conformations with precisely controlled local potentials. We provide a general method for optimizing periodic planar radio-frequency electrodes for generating ion trapping potentials with specified trap locations and curvatures above the electrode plane. A linear-programming algorithm guarantees globally optimal electrode shapes that require only a single radio-frequency voltage source for operation. The optimization method produces final electrode shapes that are smooth and exhibit low fragmentation. Such characteristics are desirable for practical fabrication of surface-electrode trap lattices.

<p><strong>11.    Constructing General Unitary Maps from State Preparations</strong><br>
Seth T. Merkel, Gavin Brennen, Poul S. Jessen, Ivan H. Deutsch<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1969">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1969</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an efficient algorithm for generating unitary maps on a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space from a time-dependent Hamiltonian through a combination of stochastic searches and geometric construction. The protocol is based on the eigen-decomposition of the map. A unitary matrix can be implemented by sequentially mapping each eigenvector to a fiducial state, imprinting the eigenphase on that state, and mapping it back to the eigenvector. This requires the design of only $d$ state-to-state maps generated by control waveforms that are efficiently found by a gradient search with computational resources that scale polynomially in $d$. In contrast, the complexity of a stochastic search for a single waveform that simultaneously acts as desired on all eigenvectors scales exponentially in $d$. We extend this construction to design maps on an $n$-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space using only $n$ stochastic searches. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be used to control atomic spins in the ground electronic hyperfine manifold of alkali atoms in order to implement general qudit logic gates as well to perform a simple form of error correction on an embedded qubit.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many experiments in quantum information aim at creating multi-partite entangled states. Quantifying the amount of entanglement that was actually generated can, in principle, be accomplished using full-state tomography. This method requires the determination of a parameter set that is growing exponentially with the number of qubits and becomes infeasible even for moderate numbers of particles. Non-trivial bounds on experimentally prepared entanglement can however be obtained from partial information on the density matrix. The fundamental question that needs to be addressed in this context is then formulated as: What is the entanglement content of the least entangled quantum state that is compatible with the available measurement data? We formulate the problem mathematically employing methods from the theory of semi-definite programming and then address this problem for the case, where the goal of the experiment is the creation of graph states. The observables that we consider are the generators of the stabilizer group, thus the number of measurement settings grows only linearly in the number of qubits. We provide analytical solutions as well as numerical methods that may be applied directly to experiments, and compare the obtained bounds with results from full-state tomography for simulated data.

<blockquote>
<p>
Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been often proposed for generating nonlinear optical effects at the single photon level; in particular, as a means to effect a quantum non-demolition measurement of a single photon field. Previous treatments have usually considered homogeneously broadened samples, but realisations in any medium will have to contend with inhomogeneous broadening. Here we reappraise an earlier scheme [Munro \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. A \textbf{71}, 033819 (2005)] with respect to inhomogeneities and show an alternative mode of operation that is preferred in an inhomogeneous environment. We further show the implications of these results on a potential implementation in diamond containing nitrogen-vacancy colour centres. Our modelling shows that single mode waveguide structures of length $200 \mu\mathrm{m}$ in single-crystal diamond containing a dilute ensemble of NV$^-$ of only 200 centres are sufficient for quantum non-demolition measurements using EIT-based weak nonlinear interactions.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a geometric description to study the relativistic EPR correlations in curved spacetime background given by the application of the Fermi-Walker transport in the relativistic EPR states and we show that its result has the same effect as the applications of successive infinitesimal Lorentz boosts in the relativistic EPR states. We also show that the expression for the Bell inequality due to the Fermi-Walker transport is equivalent to the expression demonstrated by Terashima and Ueda \cite{TU2}, where the degree of violation of the Bell inequality is dependent of the angle of the Wigner rotation. This geometrical approach to study the relativistic EPR correlations is a promissing formulation to investigate the EPR correlations in the general relativity background.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2478">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2478</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that quantum subdynamics of an open quantum system can always be described by a Hermitian map, irrespective of the form of the initial total system state. Since the theory of quantum error correction was developed based on the assumption of completely positive (CP) maps, we present a generalized theory of linear quantum error correction, which applies to any linear map describing the open system evolution. In the physically relevant setting of Hermitian maps, we show that the CP-map based version of quantum error correction theory applies without modifications. However, we show that a more general scenario is also possible, where the recovery map is Hermitian but not CP. Since non-CP maps have non-positive matrices in their range, we provide a geometric characterization of the positivity domain of general linear maps. In particular, we show that this domain is convex, and that this implies a simple algorithm for finding its boundary.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises secure key agreement by using quantum mechanical systems. We argue that QKD will be an important part of future cryptographic infrastructures. It can provide long-term confidentiality for encrypted information without reliance on computational assumptions.

The spontaneous decay of a V-type three-level atom placed in a negative-refractive-index waveguide is analyzed. We find that in thin waveguides, highly efficient surface guided modes are supported, which do not occur in positive index waveguides. In addition, at low absorption, the mode density and thus spontaneous emission into particular regular guided modes is enhanced by several orders of magnitude as compared to regular dielectric waveguides. The asymmetries between emission into the different modes and the enhancement of particular guided modes allow to induce strong spontaneous-emission interference between transitions with orthogonal transition dipole moments.

<p>
The diamond norm is a norm defined over the space of quantum transformations. This norm has a natural operational interpretation: it measures how well one can distinguish between two transformations by applying them to a state of arbitrarily large dimension. This interpretation makes this norm useful in the study of quantum interactive proof systems. In this note we exhibit an efficient algorithm for computing this norm using convex programming. Independently of us, Watrous recently showed a different algorithm to compute this norm. An immediate corollary of this algorithm is a slight simplification of the argument of Kitaev and Watrous [STOC 2000] that QIP is contained in EXP.

<blockquote>
<p>
The Polya number of a classical random walk on a regular lattice is known to depend solely on the dimension of the lattice. For one and two dimensions it equals one, meaning unit probability to return to the origin. This result is extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry, any deviation from the equal probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of the walk from recurrent to transient. Applying our definition of the Polya number to quantum walks on a line we show that the recurrence character of quantum walks is more stable against bias. We determine the range of parameters for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent. We find that there exist genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent.

<p>
We discuss in detail how non-Markovian open system dynamics can be described in terms of quantum jumps [J. Piilo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 180402 (2008)]. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to have a jump description contained in the physical Hilbert space of the reduced system. The developed non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach is a generalization of the Markovian Monte Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method into the non-Markovian regime. The method conserves both the probabilities in the density matrix and the norms of the state vectors exactly, and sheds new light on non-Markovian dynamics. The dynamics of the pure state ensemble illustrates how local-in-time master equation can describe memory effects and how the current state of the system carries information on its earlier state. Our approach solves the problem of negative jump probabilities of the Markovian MCWF method in the non-Markovian regime by defining the corresponding jump process with positive probability. The results demonstrate that in the theoretical description of non-Markovian open systems, there occurs quantum jumps which recreate seemingly lost superpositions due to the memory.

<p>
We consider two-party quantum protocols starting with a transmission of some random BB84 qubits followed by classical messages. We show a general &quot;compiler&quot; improving the security of such protocols: if the original protocol is secure against an &quot;almost honest&quot; adversary, then the compiled protocol is secure against an arbitrary computationally bounded (quantum) adversary. The compilation preserves the number of qubits sent and the number of rounds up to a constant factor. The compiler also preserves security in the bounded-quantum-storage model (BQSM), so if the original protocol was BQSM-secure, the compiled protocol can only be broken by an adversary who has large quantum memory and large computing power. This is in contrast to known BQSM-secure protocols, where security breaks down completely if the adversary has larger quantum memory than expected. We show how our technique can be applied to quantum identification and oblivious transfer protocols.

<blockquote>
<p>
In certain situations the state of a quantum system, after transmission through a quantum channel, can be perfectly restored. This can be done by &#39;coding&#39; the state space of the system before transmission into a &#39;protected&#39; part of a larger state space, and by applying a proper &#39;decoding&#39; map afterwards. We investigate two kinds of protected subspaces: the error correction subspaces and the dark subspaces. In neither case information leaks out of the system, but in the second it is more difficult to restore the state. Recent results on higher rank numerical ranges of operators are used to construct examples. In particular, dark spaces are constructed for any map of rank 2, for a biased permutations channel and for certain separable maps acting on multipartite systems. Furthermore, error correction subspaces are provided for a class of three unitary noise models.

Several schemes are discussed for constructing the two Bell pairs. We also show how one can produce an unbalanced two-qutrit state that could be of general purpose use in some protocols. In terms of applications of the maximally entangled qutrit state, we mainly focus on how to use the state to demonstrate a violation of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality under the restriction of measurements which can be performed using linear optical elements and photon counting. Other possible applications of the state, such as for higher dimensional quantum cryptography, teleportation, and generation of heralded two-qudit states are also briefly discussed.

<p>
We report photonic quantum circuits created using an ultrafast laser processing technique that is rapid, requires no lithographic mask and can be used to create three-dimensional networks of waveguide devices. We have characterized directional couplers--the key functional elements of photonic quantum circuits--and found that they perform as well as lithographically produced waveguide devices. We further demonstrate high-performance interferometers and an important multi-photon quantum interference phenomenon for the first time in integrated optics. This direct-write approach will enable the rapid development of sophisticated quantum optical circuits and their scaling into three-dimensions.

<blockquote>
<p>
Renyi entropy associated with spin tomograms of quantum states is shown to obey to new inequalities containing the dependence on quantum Fourier transform. The limiting inequality for the von Neumann entropy of spin quantum states and a new kind of entropy associated with quantum Fourier transform are obtained. Possible connections with subadditivity and strong subadditivity conditions for tomographic entropies and von Neumann entropies are discussed.

<p><strong>28.    Optimal correction of concatenated fault-tolerant quantum codes</strong><br>

Quantum Information Processing 11, 1511 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4506">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4506</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method of concatenated quantum error correction in which improved classical processing is used with existing quantum codes and fault-tolerant circuits to more reliably correct errors. Rather than correcting each level of a concatenated code independently, our method uses information about the likelihood of errors having occurred at lower levels to maximize the probability of correctly interpreting error syndromes. Results of simulations of our method applied to the [[4,1,2]] subsystem code indicate that it can correct a number of discrete errors up to half of the distance of the concatenated code, which is optimal.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a gas of ultracold atoms resonantly driven into a strongly interacting Rydberg state. The long distance behavior of the spatially frozen effective pseudospin system is determined by a set of dimensionless parameters, and we find that the experimental data exhibits algebraic scaling laws for the excitation dynamics and the saturation of Rydberg excitation. Mean field calculations as well as numerical simulations provide an excellent agreement with the experimental finding, and are evidence for universality in a strongly interacting frozen Rydberg gas.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4603">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4603</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply a Bayesian data analysis scheme known as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states. This method yields a vector, known as the Markov chain, which contains the full statistical information concerning all reconstruction parameters including their statistical correlations with no a priori assumptions as to the form of the distribution from which it has been obtained. From this vector can be derived, e. g. the marginal distributions and uncertainties of all model parameters and also of other quantities such as the purity of the reconstructed state. We demonstrate the utility of this scheme by reconstructing the Wigner function of phase-diffused squeezed states. These states posses non-Gaussian statistics and therefore represent a non-trivial case of tomographic reconstruction. We compare our results to those obtained through pure maximum-likelihood and Fisher information approaches.

<p>
We demonstrate an implementation scheme for constructing quantum gates using unitary evolutions of the one-dimensional spin-J ferromagnetic XXZ chain. We present numerical results based on simulations of the chain using the time-dependent DMRG method and techniques from optimal control theory. Using only a few control parameters, we find that it is possible to implement one- and two-qubit gates on a system of spin-3/2 XXZ chains, such as Not, Hadamard, Pi-8, Phase, and C-Not, with fidelity levels exceeding 99%.

<p><strong>32.    The One-Way Communication Complexity of Group Membership</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3175">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3175</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper studies the one-way communication complexity of the subgroup membership problem, a classical problem closely related to basic questions in quantum computing. Here Alice receives, as input, a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$; Bob receives an element $x \in G$. Alice is permitted to send a single message to Bob, after which he must decide if his input $x$ is an element of $H$. We prove the following upper bounds on the classical communication complexity of this problem in the bounded-error setting: (1) The problem can be solved with $O(\log |G|)$ communication, provided the subgroup $H$ is normal; (2) The problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log |G|)$ communication, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible complex representations of $G$; (3) For any prime $p$ not dividing $|G|$, the problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log p)$ communication, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible $\F_p$-representations of $G$.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a model of repeated interaction between quantum systems which can be thought of as a non-commutative Markov chain. It is shown that there exists an outgoing Cuntz scattering system associated to this model which induces an input-output formalism with a transfer function corresponding to a multi-analytic operator, in the sense of multivariate operator theory. Finally we show that observability for this system is closely related to the scattering theory of non-commutative Markov chains.

G. L. Klimchitskaya, U. Mohideen, V. M. Mostepanenko<br>
Rev.Mod.Phys.81:1827-1885,2009<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4022">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4022</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The physical origin of the Casimir force is connected with the existence of zero-point and thermal fluctuations. The Casimir effect is very general and finds applications in various fields of physics. This review is limited to the rapid progress at the intersection of experiment and theory that has been achieved in the last few years. It includes a critical assessment of the proposed approaches to the resolution of the puzzles arising in the applications of the Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces to real materials. All the primary experiments on the measurement of the Casimir force between macroscopic bodies and the Casimir-Polder force between an atom and a wall that have been performed in the last decade are reviewed, including the theory needed for their interpretation. The methodology for the comparison between experiment and theory in the force-distance measurements is presented. The experimental and theoretical results described here provide a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of dispersion forces in real materials and offer guidance for the application of Lifshitz theory for the interpretation of the measurement results.

<p><strong>35.    Higher rank numerical ranges of normal matrices</strong><br>
Hwa-Long Gau, Chi-Kwong Li, Yiu-Tung Poon, Nung-Sing Sze<br>
SIAM J. Matrix Analysis Appl, 32:23-43, 2011<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4869">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4869</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The higher rank numerical range is closely connected to the construction of quantum error correction code for a noisy quantum channel. It is known that if a normal matrix $A \in M_n$ has eigenvalues $a_1, ..., a_n$, then its higher rank numerical range $\Lambda_k(A)$ is the intersection of convex polygons with vertices $a_{j_1}, ..., a_{j_{n-k+1}}$, where $1 \le j_1 &lt; ... &lt; j_{n-k+1} \le n$. In this paper, it is shown that the higher rank numerical range of a normal matrix with $m$ distinct eigenvalues can be written as the intersection of no more than $\max{m,4}$ closed half planes. In addition, given a convex polygon ${\mathcal P}$ a construction is given for a normal matrix $A \in M_n$ with minimum $n$ such that $\Lambda_k(A) = {\mathcal P}$. In particular, if ${\mathcal P}$ has $p$ vertices, with $p \ge 3$, there is a normal matrix $A \in M_n$ with $n \le \max\left{p+k-1, 2k+2 \right}$ such that $\Lambda_k(A) = {\mathcal P}$.
