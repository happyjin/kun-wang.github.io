<p>
Optical cavities are of central importance in numerous areas of physics, including precision measurement, cavity optomechanics and cavity quantum electrodynamics. The miniaturisation and scaling to large numbers of sites is of interest for many of these applications, in particular for quantum computation and simulation. Here we present the first scaled microcavity system which enables the creation of large numbers of highly uniform, tunable light-matter interfaces using ions, neutral atoms or solid-state qubits. The microcavities are created by means of silicon micro-fabrication, are coupled directly to optical fibres and can be independently tuned to the chosen frequency, paving the way for arbitrarily large networks of optical microcavities.

<p><strong>2.    Non-Markovian quantum jumps from measurements in bipartite Markovian dynamics</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum jump approach allows to characterize the stochastic dynamics associated to an open quantum system submitted to a continuous measurement action. In this paper we show that this formalism can consistently be extended to non-Markovian system dynamics. The results rely in studying a measurement process performed on a bipartite arrangement characterized by a Markovian Lindblad evolution. Both a renewal and non-renewal extensions are found. The general structure of non-local master equations that admit an unravelling in terms of the corresponding non-Markovian trajectories are also found. Studying a two-level system dynamics, it is demonstrated that non-Markovian effects such as an environment-to-system flow of information may be present in the ensemble dynamics.

<p><strong>3.    Markovian embedding of non-Markovian quantum collisional models</strong><br>
Adrian A. Budini<br>
Phys. Rev. A 88, 032115 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0122">http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0122</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A wide class of non-Markovian completely positive master equations can be formulated on the basis of quantum collisional models. In this phenomenological approach the dynamics of an open quantum system is modeled through an ensemble of stochastic realizations that consist in the application at random times of a (collisional) completely positive transformation over the system state. In this paper, we demonstrate that these kinds of models can be embedded in bipartite Markovian Lindblad dynamics consisting of the system of interest and an auxiliary one. In contrast with phenomenological formulations, here the stochastic ensemble dynamics an the inter-event time interval statistics are obtained from a quantum measurement theory after assuming that the auxiliary system is continuously monitored in time. Models where the system inter-collisional dynamics is non-Markovian [B. Vacchini, Phys. Rev. A 87, 030101(R) (2013)] are also obtained from the present approach. The formalism is exemplified through bipartite dynamics that leads to non-Markovian system effects such as an environment-to-system back flow of information.

<p><strong>4.    Hyperentanglement purification and concentration assisted by diamond NV centers inside photonic crystal cavities</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement has attracted much attention for its fascinating applications in quantum communication. However, it is impossible to purify a pair of photon systems in a mixed hyperentangled state with errors in two degrees of freedom using linear optical elements only, far different from all the existing entanglement purification protocols in a degree of freedom (DOF) for quantum systems. Here, we investigate the possibility of purifying a spatial-polarization mixed hyperentangled Bell state with the errors in both the spatial mode and polarization DOFs, resorting to the nonlinear optics of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond embedded in a photonic crystal cavity coupled to a waveguide. We present the first hyperentanglement purification protocol for purifying a pair of two-photon systems in a mixed hyperentangled Bell state with the errors in two DOFs. Besides, we propose an efficient hyperentanglement concentration protocol for a partially hyperentangled Bell pure state, which has the maximal success probability in principle. These two protocols are useful in long-distance quantum communication with hyperentanglement

<p><strong>5.    Robust, scalable Hong-Ou-Mandel manifolds in quantum optical ring resonators</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Information Processing, from cryptography to computation, based upon linear quantum optical circuit elements relies heavily on the ability offered by the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) Effect to route photons from separate input modes into one of two common output modes. Specifically, the HOM Effect accomplishes the path entanglement of two photons at a time such that no coincidences are observed in the output modes of a system exhibiting the effect. In this paper, we prove in principle that a significant increase in the robustness of the HOM Effect can be accomplished in a scalable, readily manufactured nanophotonic system comprised of two waveguides coupled, on chip, to a ring resonator. We show that by operating such a device properly, one can conditionally bunch coincident input photons in a way that is far more robust and controllable than possible with an ordinary balanced beam splitter.

<p><strong>6.    Bound states of the one-dimensional Dirac equation for scalar and vector double square-well potentials</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We have analytically studied bound states of the one-dimensional Dirac equation for scalar and vector double square-well potentials (DSPs), by using the transfer-matrix method. Detailed numerical calculations of the eigenvalue, wave function and density probability have been performed for the three cases: (1) vector DSP only, (2) scalar DSP only, and (3) scalar and vector DSPs with equal magnitudes. We discuss the difference and similarity among results of the cases (1)-(3) in the Dirac equation and that in the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation. Motion of a wave packet is calculated for a study on quantum tunneling through the central barrier in the DSP.

<p><strong>7.    Secure communication with choice of measurement</strong><br>
Dong Xie, An Min Wang<br>
European Physical Journal D (2014) Volume 68, Issue 10<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0312">http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0312</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It has been found that the signal can be encoded in the choice of the measurement basis of one of the communicating parties, while the outcomes of the measurement are irrelevant for the communication and therefore may be discarded. The proposed protocol was novel and interesting, but it wasn&#39;t secure for communication. The eavesdropper can obtain the information without being detected. We utilize the outcomes of the measurement to propose a secure communication protocol. And the error correction code is used to increase the fault tolerance in the noise.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the detection of an ultra-bright single-photon source using highly efficient superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) at telecom wavelengths. Both the single-photon source and the detectors are characterized in detail. At a pump power of 100 mW (400 mW), the measured coincidence counts can achieve 400 kcps (1.17 Mcps), which is the highest ever reported at telecom wavelengths to the best of our knowledge. The multi-pair contributions at different pump powers are analyzed in detail. We compare the experimental and theoretical second order coherence functions $g^{(2)}(0)$ and find that the conventional experimentally measured $g^{(2)}(0)$ values are smaller than the theoretically expected ones. We also consider the saturation property of SNSPD and find that SNSPD can be easier to saturate with a thermal state rather than with a coherent state. The experimental data and theoretical analysis should be useful for the future experiments to detect ultra-bright down-conversion sources with high-efficiency detectors.

<blockquote>
<p>
A recent method called Asymptotic Taylor expansion (ATEM) is applied to determine the analytical expression for eigenfunctions and numerical results for eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation for the bistable potentials. Optimal truncation of the Taylor series gives a best possible analytical expression for eigenfunctions and numerical result for eigenvalues. It is shown that the results are obtained by a simple algorithm constructed for a computer system using symbolic or numerical calculation. It is observed that ATEM produces excellent results appropriate with the existing literature.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum speed limit (QSL) under noise has drawn considerable attention in real quantum computational processes and quantum communication. Though non-Markovian noise is proven to be able to accelerate quantum evolution for a damped Jaynes-Cummings model, in this work we show that non-Markovianity may even slow down the quantum evolution of an experimentally controllable photon system. As an important application, QSL time of a photon can be well controlled by regulating the relevant environment parameter properly, which is close to reach the currently available photonic experimental technology.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum metrology exploits quantum mechanical laws to improve the precision in estimating technologically relevant parameters such as phase, frequency, or magnetic fields. Probe states are usually tailored on the particular dynamics whose parameters are being estimated. Here we consider a novel framework where quantum estimation is performed in an interferometric configuration, using bipartite probe states prepared when only the spectrum of the generating Hamiltonian is known. We introduce a figure of merit for the scheme, given by the worst case precision over all suitable Hamiltonians, and prove that it amounts exactly to a computable measure of discord-type quantum correlations for the input probe. We complement our theoretical results with a metrology experiment, realized in a highly controllable room-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance setup, which provides a proof-of-concept demonstration for the usefulness of discord in sensing applications. Discordant probes are shown to guarantee a nonzero precision in the estimation procedure for different generating Hamiltonians, while classically correlated probes are unable to accomplish the estimation in a worst case setting. This work establishes a rigorous and direct operational interpretation for general quantum correlations, shedding light on their potential for quantum technology.

<p>
The Ermakov Lewis quantum invariant for the time dependent harmonic oscillator is expressed in terms of number and phase operators. The identification of these variables is made in accordance with the correspondence principle and the amplitude and phase representation of the classical orthogonal functions invariant. The relationship between the number and phase operators is established through this invariant as the system evolves from one frequency to another. In the specific case where the excitations represent the photon number, these relations are equivalent to the power density transport equations derived in nonlinear optical processes.

<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic techniques offer some of the most promising tools to achieve high-fidelity control of the centre-of-mass degree of freedom of single atoms. As their main requirement is to follow an eigenstate of the system, constraints on timing and field strength stability are usually low, especially for trapped systems. In this paper we present a detailed example of a technique to adiabatically transport a single atom between different waveguides on an atom chip. To ensure that all conditions are fulfilled, we carry out fully three dimensional simulations of the system, using experimentally realistic parameters. We also detail our method for simulating the system in very reasonable timescales on a consumer desktop machine by leveraging the power of GPU computing.

<p>
In this paper we study the generation of photon pairs through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a $\chi^{(3)}$ cavity. Our key interest is the generation of photon pairs in a guided-wave configuration - fiber or waveguide - where at least one of the photons in a given pair is matched in frequency and bandwidth to a particular atomic transition, as required for the implementation of photon-atom interfaces. We present expressions, along with plots, for the two-photon joint intensity both in the spectral and temporal domains. We also present expressions for the absolute brightness, along with numerical simulations, and show that the presence of the cavity can result in a flux enhancement relative to an equivalent source without a cavity.

We experimentally demonstrate that both a converted and an unconverted light pulses after wavelength conversion with various conversion efficiencies preserve phase information of an input light at a single-photon level. In our experiment, we converted temporally-separated two coherent light pulses with average photon numbers of $\sim$ 0.1 at 780 nm to light pulses at 1522 nm by using difference-frequency generation in a periodically-poled lithium niobate waveguide. We observed a single-photon interference between temporally-separated two modes for both the converted and the unconverted light pulses at various values of the conversion efficiency. We observed interference visibilities greater than 0.88 without suppressing the background noises for any value of the conversion efficiency the wavelength converter achieves. At a conversion efficiency of $\sim$ 0.5, the observed visibilities are 0.98 for the unconverted light and 0.99 for the converted light.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the transport properties of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) over finite two-dimensional structures with a given number of randomly placed bonds and with different aspect ratios (AR). Here, we focus on the transport from, say, the left side to the right side of the structure where absorbing sites are placed. We do so by analyzing the long-time average of the survival probability of CTQW. We compare the results to the classical continuous-time random walk case (CTRW). For small AR (landscape configurations) we observe only small differences between the quantum and the classical transport properties, i.e., roughly the same number of bonds is needed to facilitate the transport. However, with increasing AR (portrait configurations) a much larger number of bonds is needed in the CTQW case than in the CTRW case. While for CTRW the number of bonds needed decreases when going from small AR to large AR, for CTRW this number is large for small AR, has a minimum for the square configuration, and increases again for increasing AR. We corroborate our findings for large AR by showing that the corresponding quantum eigenstates are strongly localized in situations in which the transport is facilitated in the CTRW case.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a discrete-time quantum walk (QW) on the line with a single phase at the origin which was introduced and studied by Wojcik et al.[1]. We call the model &quot;Wojcik model&quot; here. Konno et al.[2] investigated other types of QWs with one defect at the origin. They presented a method which gives the stationary measure corresponding to localization for the QWs by use of the generating functions splitted in positive and negative parts respectively. In this paper, we call the method &quot;the splitted generating function method (the SGF method)&quot;. To clarify in detail which QW is appropriate for the method in the case of study is one of the important challenges to investigate localization properties for various QWs. As for the Wojcik model, we solve the eigenvalue problem by the SGF method and our results agree with Ref.[1]. From the solution of the problem, we derive a stationary measure with an exponential decay for the position. The explicit expression for the stationary measure is symmetric for the origin and ensures localization depending on the initial coin state.

Furthermore, using a Ti:Tm:LiNbO3 waveguide cooled to 3 Kelvin, a phase modulator, and a spectral filter, we demonstrate storage followed by the required feed-forward-controlled frequency manipulation with time-bin qubits encoded into up to 26 multiplexed spectral modes and 97% fidelity.

Quantum coherent feedback has been proven to be an efficient way to tune the dynamics of quantum optical systems and, recently, those of solid-state quantum circuits. Here, inspired by the recent progress of quantum feedback experiments, especially those in mesoscopic circuits, we prove that superconducting circuit QED systems, shunted with a coherent feedback loop, can change the dynamics of a superconducting transmission line resonator, i.e., a linear quantum cavity, and lead to strong on-chip nonlinear optical phenomena. We find that bistability can occur under the semiclassical approximation, and photon anti-bunching can be shown in the quantum regime. Our study presents new perspectives for engineering nonlinear quantum dynamics on a chip.

<p>
Highly nonclassical quantum states of light, characterized by Wigner functions with negative values, have been created so far only in a heralded fashion. In this case, the desired output emerges rarely and randomly from a quantum-state generator. An important example is the heralded production of high-purity single-photon states, typically based on some nonlinear optical interaction. In contrast, on-demand single-photon sources were also reported, exploiting the quantized level structure of matter systems. These sources, however, lead to highly impure output states, composed mostly of vacuum. While such impure states may still exhibit certain single-photon-like features such as anti-bunching, they are not enough nonclassical for advanced quantum information processing. On the other hand, the intrinsic randomness of pure, heralded states can be circumvented by first storing and then releasing them on demand. Here we propose such a controlled release, and we experimentally demonstrate it for heralded single photons. We employ two optical cavities, where the photons are both created and stored inside one cavity, and finally released through a dynamical tuning of the other cavity. We demonstrate storage times of up to 300 ns, while keeping the single-photon purity around 50% after storage. This is the first demonstration of a negative Wigner function at the output of an on-demand photon source or a quantum memory. In principle, our storage system is compatible with all kinds of nonclassical states, including those known to be essential for many advanced quantum information protocols.

<p>
Adiabatic quantum computing is a promising route to the computational power afforded by quantum information processing. The recent availability of adiabatic hardware has raised challenging questions about how to evaluate adiabatic quantum optimization programs. Processor behavior depends on multiple steps to synthesize an adiabatic quantum program, which are each highly tunable. We present an integrated programming and development environment for adiabatic quantum optimization called JADE that provides control over all the steps taken during program synthesis. JADE captures the workflow needed to rigorously specify the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm while allowing a variety of problem types, programming techniques, and processor configurations. We have also integrated JADE with a quantum simulation engine that enables program profiling using numerical calculation. The computational engine supports plug-ins for simulation methodologies tailored to various metrics and computing resources. We present the design, integration, and deployment of JADE and discuss its potential use for benchmarking adiabatic quantum optimization programs by the quantum computer science community.

From the unitary operator used for implementing two-state discrete-time quantum walk on one-, two- and three- dimensional lattice we obtain a two-component Dirac-like Hamiltonian. In particular, using different pairs of Pauli basis as position translation states we obtain three different form of Hamiltonians for evolution on one-dimensional lattice. We extend this to two- and three-dimensional lattices using different Pauli basis states as position translation states for each dimension and show that the external coin operation, which is necessary for one-dimensional walk is not a necessary requirement for a walk on higher dimensions but can serve as an additional resource to control the dynamics. The two-component Hamiltonian we present here for quantum walk on different lattices can serve as a general framework to simulate, control, and study the dynamics of quantum systems governed by Dirac-like Hamiltonian.

<p>
Random numbers represent a fundamental ingredient for numerical simulation, games, informa- tion science and secure communication. Algorithmic and deterministic generators are affected by insufficient information entropy. On the other hand, suitable physical processes manifest intrinsic unpredictability that may be exploited for generating genuine random numbers with an entropy reaching the ideal limit. In this work, we present a method to extract genuine random bits by using the atmospheric turbulence: by sending a laser beam along a 143Km free-space link, we took advantage of the chaotic behavior of air refractive index in the optical propagation. Random numbers are then obtained by converting in digital units the aberrations and distortions of the received laser wave-front. The generated numbers, obtained without any post-processing, pass the most selective randomness tests. The core of our extracting algorithm can be easily generalized for other physical processes.

<blockquote>
<p>
A photonic process named as &quot;quantum state joining&quot; has been recently experimentally demonstrated [C. Vitelli et al., Nature Photon. 7, 521 (2013)] that corresponds to the transfer of the internal two-dimensional quantum states of two input photons, i.e., two photonic qubits, into the four-dimensional quantum state of a single photon, i.e., a photonic ququart. A scheme for the inverse process, namely &quot;quantum state splitting&quot;, has also been theoretically proposed. Both processes can be iterated in a cascaded layout, to obtain the joining and/or splitting of more than two qubits, thus leading to a general scheme for varying the number of photons in the system while preserving its total quantum state, or quantum information content. Here, we revisit these processes from a theoretical point of view. After casting the theory of the joining and splitting processes in the more general photon occupation number notation, we introduce some modified schemes that are in principle unitary (not considering the implementation of the CNOT gates) and do not require projection and feed-forward steps. This can be particularly important in the quantum state splitting case, to obtain a scheme that does not rely on postselection. Moreover, we formally prove that the quantum joining of two photon states with linear optics requires the use of at least one ancilla photon. This is somewhat unexpected, given that the demonstrated joining scheme involves the sequential application of two CNOT quantum gates, for which a linear optical scheme with just two photons and postselection is known to exist. Finally we explore the relationship between the joining scheme and the generation of clusters of multi-particle entangled states involving more than one qubit per particle.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate how to model Markovian evolution of coupled harmonic oscillators, each of them interacting with a local environment. When the coupling between the oscillators is weak, dissipation may be modeled using local Lindblad terms for each of the oscillators in the master equation, as is commonly done. When the coupling between oscillators is strong, this model may become invalid. We derive a master equation for two coupled harmonic oscillators which are subject to individual heat baths modeled by a collection of harmonic oscillators, and show that this master equation in general contains non-local Lindblad terms. We compare the resulting time evolution with that obtained for dissipation through local Lindblad terms for each individual oscillator, and show that the evolution is different in the two cases. In particular, the two descriptions give different predictions for the steady state and for the entanglement between strongly coupled oscillators. This shows that when describing strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, one must take great care in how dissipation is modeled, and that a description using local Lindblad terms may fail. This may be particularly relevant when attempting to generate entangled states of strongly coupled quantum systems.

It has been proved by Kempe that discrete quantum walks on the hypercube (HC) hit exponentially faster than the classical analog. The same was also observed numerically by Krovi and Brun for a slightly different property, namely, the expected hitting time. Yet, to what extent this striking result survives in more general graphs, is to date an open question. Here we tackle this question by studying the expected hitting time for quantum walks on HCs that are embedded into larger symmetric structures. By performing numerical simulations of the discrete quantum walk and deriving a general expression for the classical hitting time, we observe an exponentially increasing gap between the expected classical and quantum hitting times, not only for walks on the bare HC, but also for a large family of embedded HCs. This suggests that the quantum speedup is stable with respect to such embeddings.

We address the non-Markovian character of quantum maps describing the interaction of a qubit with a random classical field. In particular, we evaluate trace- and capacity-based non-Markovianity measures for two relevant classes of environments showing non-Gaussian fluctuations, described respectively by random telegraph noise and colored noise with spectra of the the form $1/f^\alpha$. We analyze the dynamics of both the trace distance and the quantum capacity, and show that the behavior of non-Markovianity based on both measures is qualitatively similar. Our results show that environments with a spectrum that contains a relevant low-frequency contribution are generally non-Markovian. We also find that the non-Markovianity of colored environments decreases when the number of fluctuators realizing the environment increases.

<p>
Quantum mechanical treatment of light inside dielectric media is important to understand the behavior of an optical system. In this paper, a two-level atom embedded in a rectangular waveguide surrounded by a perfect electric conductor is considered. Spontaneous emission, propagation, and detection of a photon are described by the second quantization formalism. The quantized modes for light are divided into two types: photonic propagating modes and localized modes with exponential decay along the direction of waveguide. Though spontaneous emission depends on all possible modes including the localized modes, detection far from the source only depends on the propagating modes. This discrepancy of dynamical behaviors gives two di?erent decay rates along space and time in the correlation function of the photon detection.

<p>
Quantum error correction is an important building block for reliable quantum information processing. A challenging hurdle in the theory of quantum error correction is that it is significantly more difficult to design error-correcting codes with desirable properties for quantum information processing than for traditional digital communications and computation. A typical obstacle to constructing a variety of strong quantum error-correcting codes is the complicated restrictions imposed on the structure of a code. Recently, promising solutions to this problem have been proposed in quantum information science, where in principle any binary linear code can be turned into a quantum error-correcting code by assuming a small number of reliable quantum bits. This paper studies how best to take advantage of these latest ideas to construct desirable quantum error-correcting codes of very high information rate. Our methods exploit structured high-rate low-density parity-check codes available in the classical domain and provide quantum analogues that inherit their characteristic low decoding complexity and high error correction performance even at moderate code lengths. Our approach to designing high-rate quantum error-correcting codes also allows for making direct use of other major syndrome decoding methods for linear codes, making it possible to deal with a situation where promising quantum analogues of low-density parity-check codes are difficult to find.

We study the complexity of quantum query algorithms that make p queries in parallel in each timestep. This model is in part motivated by the fact that decoherence times of qubits are typically small, so it makes sense to parallelize quantum algorithms as much as possible. We show tight bounds for a number of problems, specifically Theta((n/p)^{2/3}) p-parallel queries for element distinctness and Theta((n/p)^{k/(k+1)} for k-sum. Our upper bounds are obtained by parallelized quantum walk algorithms, and our lower bounds are based on a relatively small modification of the adversary lower bound method, combined with recent results of Belovs et al. on learning graphs. We also prove some general bounds, in particular that quantum and classical p-parallel complexity are polynomially related for all total functions f when p is small compared to f&#39;s block sensitivity.

<p>
Hybrid quantum systems seek to combine the strength of its constituents to master the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology: fast and accurate systems control together with perfect shielding from the environment, including the measurements apparatus, to achieve long quantum coherence. Excellent examples for hybrid quantum systems are heterogeneous spin systems where electron spins are used for readout and control while nuclear spins are used as long-lived quantum bits. Here we show that joint initialization, projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer conflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We demonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 %) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register allows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 %. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum error correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error avoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error correction algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms achieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving the way to large scale integrations. Our techniques can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on diamond spins, phosphorous in silicon or other spin systems like quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare earth ions in solids.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many paradoxes of quantum mechanics come from the fact that a quantum system can possess different features at the same time, such as in wave-particle duality or quantum superposition. In recent delayed-choice experiments, a quantum mechanical system can be observed to manifest one feature such as the wave or particle nature, depending on the final measurement setup, which is chosen after the system itself has already entered the measuring device; hence its behaviour is not predetermined. Here, we adapt this paradigmatic scheme to multi-dimensional quantum walks. In our experiment, the way in which a photon interferes with itself in a strongly non-trivial pattern depends on its polarisation, that is determined after the photon has already been detected. Multi-dimensional quantum walks are a very powerful tool for simulating the behaviour of complex quantum systems, due to their versatility. This is the first experiment realising a multi-dimensional quantum walk with a single-photon source and we present also the first experimental simulation of the Grover walk, a model that can be used to implement the Grover quantum search algorithm.

<blockquote>
<p>
BosonSampling, which we proposed three years ago, is a scheme for using linear-optical networks to solve sampling problems that appear to be intractable for a classical computer. In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin et al. claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device&#39;s output would be &quot;operationally indistinguishable&quot; from a uniform random outcome, at least &quot;without detailed a priori knowledge&quot;; or at any rate, that telling the two apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining why the first is based on a definition of &quot;a priori knowledge&quot; so strange that, were it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure random-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.&#39;s mistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random matrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform distribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly counter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes these two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three &quot;bonus&quot; results about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando Brandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy and that&#39;s indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit of fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can be efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for general initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known proof that FermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse techniques from our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random FermionSampling distributions.

The story of this study starts with classical complexity and takes unexpected turns providing fascinating vistas on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the global nature of entanglement and its topological properties, quantum error correction, information theory, and much more; it raises questions that touch upon some of the most fundamental issues at the heart of our understanding of quantum mechanics. At this point, the jury is still out as to whether or not such a theorem holds. This survey aims to provide a snapshot of the status in this ongoing story, tailored to a general theory-of-CS audience.

<blockquote>
<p>
The hierarchical equations of motion technique has found widespread success as a tool to generate the numerically exact dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems. However, its application to low temperature environments remains a serious challenge due to the need for a deep hierarchy that arises from the Matsubara expansion of the bath correlation function. Here we present a hybrid stochastic hierarchical equation of motion (sHEOM) approach that alleviates this bottleneck and leads to a numerical cost that is nearly independent of temperature. Additionally, the sHEOM method generally converges with fewer hierarchy tiers allowing for the treatment of larger systems. Benchmark calculations are presented on the dynamics of two level systems at both high and low temperatures to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. Then the hybrid method is used to generate the exact dynamics of systems that are nearly impossible to treat by the standard hierarchy. First, exact energy transfer rates are calculated across a broad range of temperatures revealing the deviations from the Forster rates. This is followed by computations of the entanglement dynamics in a system of two qubits at low temperature spanning the weak to strong system-bath coupling regimes.

The minimum amount of resources to recognize a nonregular language is a fundamental research topic in theoretical computer science which has been examined for different kinds of resources and many different models. In this note, we focus on unary languages and space complexity on counters.

It is known that any 2DCA using a sublinear space on its counter can recognize only regular languages \cite{DG82B}. In this note, we show that bounded-error 2QCCAs can recognize a non-regular unary language by using logarithmic space on its counters for the members. Note that it is still an open problem whether bounded-error 2QCFA can recognize a non-regular unary language.

Computations are performed in the framework of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature with account of analytic corrections to the proximity force approximation and of surface roughness using both the Drude and the plasma model approaches. The theory of magnetic interaction between a sphere and a plate due to domain structure of their surfaces is developed for both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetizations in the absence and in the presence of spontaneous magnetization. It is shown that in all cases the magnetic contribution to the measured force gradients is much smaller than the total experimental error. The comparison between experiment and theory is done using the rigorous statistical method. It is shown that the theoretical approach taking into account dissipation of free electrons is excluded by the data at a 95% confidence level. The approach neglecting dissipation is confirmed by the data at more than 90% confidence level. We prove that the results of experiments with Ni-Ni, Ni-Au and Au-Au surfaces taken together cannot be reconciled with the approach including free electrons dissipation by the introduction of any unaccounted background force, either attractive or repulsive.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that massive low energy particles traversing a branching zone or a crossing of quantum waveguides may experience a non standard trapping force that cannot be derived from a potential. For interacting cold Bose atoms we report on the formation of a localised Hartree ground state for three prototype waveguide geometries with broken translational symmetry: a cranked L-shaped waveguide L, a T-shaped waveguide T, and the crossing C of two quantum waveguides. The phenomenon is kinetic energy driven and cannot be described within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Depending on the ratio of joining lateral tube diameters of the respective waveguides C,L,T delocalisation commences when the particle number N approaches a critical value. For the case of a binary mixture of two different Bose atom species A and B we observe non standard trapping of both atom species for subcritical particle numbers. A sudden demixing quantum transition takes place as the total particle number N=N_{A}+N_{B} is increased at fixed mixing ratio N_{A}/N_{B}. Depending on the mass ratio m_{A}/m_{B} the heavier atom species delocalises first for a wide range of interaction parameters. The numerical calculations are based on a splitting scheme involving an analytic approximation to the short time asymptotics of the imaginary time quantum propagator of a single particle obeying to Dirichlet boundary conditions at the walls inside the respective waveguides.
