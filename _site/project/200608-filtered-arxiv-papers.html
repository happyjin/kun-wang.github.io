    <p><strong>1.    Security of coherent state quantum cryptography in the presence of Gaussian noise</strong><br>
Matthias Heid, Norbert Lütkenhaus<br>
Phys. Rev. A, 76, 022313 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608015">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608015</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the security against collective attacks of a continuous variable quantum key distribution scheme in the asymptotic key limit for a realistic setting. The quantum channel connecting the two honest parties is assumed to be lossy and imposes Gaussian noise on the observed quadrature distributions. Secret key rates are given for direct and reverse reconciliation schemes including postselection in the collective attack scenario. The effect of a non-ideal error correction and two-way communication in the classical post-processing step is also taken into account.

<p><strong>2.    Search via Quantum Walk</strong><br>
Frédéric Magniez, Ashwin Nayak, Jérémie Roland, Miklos Santha<br>
SIAM Journal on Computing, 40(1):142-164, 2011<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608026">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608026</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new method for designing quantum search algorithms for finding a &quot;marked&quot; element in the state space of a classical Markov chain. The algorithm is based on a quantum walk \&#39;a la Szegedy (2004) that is defined in terms of the Markov chain. The main new idea is to apply quantum phase estimation to the quantum walk in order to implement an approximate reflection operator. This operator is then used in an amplitude amplification scheme. As a result we considerably expand the scope of the previous approaches of Ambainis (2004) and Szegedy (2004). Our algorithm combines the benefits of these approaches in terms of being able to find marked elements, incurring the smaller cost of the two, and being applicable to a larger class of Markov chains. In addition, it is conceptually simple and avoids some technical difficulties in the previous analyses of several algorithms based on quantum walk.

<p><strong>3.    Universal Mixing of Quantum Walk on Graphs</strong><br>
W. Carlson, A. Ford, E. Harris, J. Rosen, C. Tamon, K. Wrobel<br>
Quantum Information and Computation 7(8):738-751, 2007<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608044">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608044</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the set of probability distributions visited by a continuous-time quantum walk on graphs. An edge-weighted graph G is universal mixing if the instantaneous or average probability distribution of the quantum walk on G ranges over all probability distributions on the vertices as the weights are varied over non-negative reals. The graph is uniform mixing if it visits the uniform distribution. Our results include the following: (a) All weighted complete multipartite graphs are instantaneous universal mixing. This is in contrast to the fact that no unweighted complete multipartite graphs are uniform mixing (except for the four-cycle). (b) The weighted claw or star graph is a minimally connected instantaneous universal mixing graph. In fact, as a corollary, the unweighted claw is instantaneous uniform mixing. This adds a new family of uniform mixing graphs to a list that so far contains only the hypercubes. (c) Any weighted graph is average almost-uniform mixing unless its spectral type is sublinear in the size of the graph. This provides a nearly tight characterization for average uniform mixing on circulant graphs. (d) No weighted graphs are average universal mixing. This shows that weights do not help to achieve average universal mixing, unlike the instantaneous case. Our proofs exploit the spectra of the underlying weighted graphs and path collapsing arguments.

<p><strong>4.    Demonstrating multipartite entanglement of single-particle W states: linear optical schemes</strong><br>
Hyunchul Nha, Jaewan Kim<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 012326 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608055">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608055</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two linear optical schemes using nonideal photodetectors to demonstrate inseparability of W-type N-partite entangled states containing only a single photon. First, we show that the pairwise entanglement of arbitrary two modes chosen from N optical modes can be detected using the method proposed by Nha and Kim [Phys. Rev. A 74, 012317 (2006)], thereby suggesting the full inseparability among N parties. In particular, this scheme is found to succeed for any nonzero quantum efficiency of photodetectors. Second, we consider a quantum teleportation network using linear optics without auxiliary modes. The conditional teleportation can be optimized by a suitable choice of the transmittance of the beam splitter in the Bell measurement. Specifically, we identify the conditions under which maximum fidelity larger than classical bound 2/3 is achieved only in cooperation with other parties. We also investigate the case of on-off photodetectors that cannot discriminate the number of detected photons.

<p><strong>5.    Generalization of Quantum Error Correction via the Heisenberg Picture</strong><br>
Cedric Beny, Achim Kempf, David W. Kribs<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett., 98, 100502 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608071">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608071</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the theory of operator quantum error correction can be naturally generalized by allowing constraints not only on states but also on observables. The resulting theory describes the correction of algebras of observables (and may therefore suitably be called ``operator algebra quantum error correction&#39;&#39;). In particular, the approach provides a framework for the correction of hybrid quantum-classical information and it does not require the state to be entirely in one of the corresponding subspaces or subsystems. We discuss applications to quantum teleportation and to the study of information flows in quantum interactions.

<p><strong>6.    100 km secure differential phase shift quantum key distribution with low jitter up-conversion detectors</strong><br>
Eleni Diamanti, Hiroki Takesue, Carsten Langrock, M. M. Fejer, Yoshihisa Yamamoto<br>
Optics Express 14, 13073 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608110">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608110</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum key distribution experiment in which keys that were secure against all individual eavesdropping attacks allowed by quantum mechanics were distributed over 100 km of optical fiber. We implemented the differential phase shift quantum key distribution protocol and used low timing jitter 1.55 um single-photon detectors based on frequency up-conversion in periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides and silicon avalanche photodiodes. Based on the security analysis of the protocol against general individual attacks, we generated secure keys at a practical rate of 166 bit/s over 100 km of fiber. The use of the low jitter detectors also increased the sifted key generation rate to 2 Mbit/s over 10 km of fiber.

<p><strong>7.    Gate-level simulation of logical state preparation</strong><br>
A. M. Stephens, S. J. Devitt, A. G. Fowler, J. C. Ang, L. C. L. Hollenberg<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608112">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608112</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation are two fundamental concepts which make quantum computing feasible. While providing a theoretical means with which to ensure the arbitrary accuracy of any quantum circuit, fault-tolerant error correction is predicated upon the robust preparation of logical states. An optimal direct circuit and a more complex fault-tolerant circuit for the preparation of the [[7,1,3]] Steane logical-zero are simulated in the presence of discrete quantum errors to quantify the regime within which fault-tolerant preparation of logical states is preferred.

<p><strong>8.    Retrodictive fidelities for pure state postselectors</strong><br>
John Jeffers<br>
New J. Phys. 8, 268 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608113">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608113</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Two measures of fidelity are proposed for postselecting devices, the retrodictive conditional probability that the state in the measurement arm is the one indicated by the detectors, and the probability that the device produces the state that it would produce if working perfectly. The first is the natural quantity that one wishes to maximise to improve the device operation. The second corresponds more closely with the accurate operation of the device than the more usual overlap-based fidelity. The results are particularly applicable to the types of state preparation and logic gate operation in linear optical quantum computing.

<p><strong>9.    Non-Markovian decoherence in the adiabatic quantum search algorithm</strong><br>
Markus Tiersch, Ralf Schützhold<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 062313 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608123">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608123</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider an adiabatic quantum algorithm (Grover&#39;s search routine) weakly coupled to a rather general environment, i.e., without using the Markov approximation. Markovian errors generally require high-energy excitations (of the reservoir) and tend to destroy the scalability of the adiabatic quantum algorithm. We find that, under appropriate conditions (such as low temperatures), the low-energy (i.e., non-Markovian) modes of the bath are most important. Hence the scalability of the adiabatic quantum algorithm depends on the infra-red behavior of the environment: a reasonably small coupling to the three-dimensional electromagnetic field does not destroy the scaling behavior, whereas phonons or localized degrees of freedom can be problematic.

<p><strong>10.    The Learnability of Quantum States</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608142">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608142</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Traditional quantum state tomography requires a number of measurements that grows exponentially with the number of qubits n. But using ideas from computational learning theory, we show that &quot;for most practical purposes&quot; one can learn a state using a number of measurements that grows only linearly with n. Besides possible implications for experimental physics, our learning theorem has two applications to quantum computing: first, a new simulation of quantum one-way communication protocols, and second, the use of trusted classical advice to verify untrusted quantum advice.

<p><strong>11.    Strong Parallel Repetition Theorem for Quantum XOR Proof Systems</strong><br>
Richard Cleve, William Slofstra, Falk Unger, Sarvagya Upadhyay<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608146">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608146</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a class of two-prover interactive proof systems where each prover returns a single bit to the verifier and the verifier&#39;s verdict is a function of the XOR of the two bits received. We show that, when the provers are allowed to coordinate their behavior using a shared entangled quantum state, a perfect parallel repetition theorem holds in the following sense. The prover&#39;s optimal success probability for simultaneously playing a collection of XOR proof systems is exactly the product of the individual optimal success probabilities. This property is remarkable in view of the fact that, in the classical case (where the provers can only utilize classical information), it does not hold. The theorem is proved by analyzing parities of XOR proof systems using semidefinite programming techniques, which we then relate to parallel repetitions of XOR games via Fourier analysis.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608154">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608154</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove several theorems to give sufficient conditions for convergence of quantum annealing, which is a protocol to solve generic optimization problems by quantum dynamics. In particular the property of strong ergodicity is proved for the path-integral Monte Carlo implementation of quantum annealing for the transverse Ising model under a power decay of the transverse field. This result is to be compared with the much slower inverse-log decay of temperature in the conventional simulated annealing. Similar results are proved for the Green&#39;s function Monte Carlo approach. Optimization problems in continuous space of particle configurations are also discussed.

<p><strong>13.    Improving the efficiency of decoding quantum error correction code</strong><br>
Kenichiro Furuta<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608155">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608155</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
To improve the efficiency of the encoding and the decoding is the important problem in the quantum error correction. In a preceding work, a general algorithm for decoding the stabilizer code is shown. This paper will show an decoding which is more efficient for some codes. The proposed decoding as well as the conventional decoding consists of the eigenvalue output step and the entanglement dissolution step. The proposed decoding outputs a part of the eigenvalues into a part of the code qubits in contrast to the conventional method&#39;s outputting into the ancilla. Besides, the proposed decoding dissolves a part of the entanglement in the eigenvalue output step in contrast to the conventional method which does not dissolve in the eigenvalue output step. With these improvements, the number of gates was reduced for some codes.

<p><strong>14.    Improved quantum algorithms for the ordered search problem via semidefinite programming</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Andrew J. Landahl, Pablo A. Parrilo<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 032335 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608161">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608161</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most basic computational problems is the task of finding a desired item in an ordered list of N items. While the best classical algorithm for this problem uses log_2 N queries to the list, a quantum computer can solve the problem using a constant factor fewer queries. However, the precise value of this constant is unknown. By characterizing a class of quantum query algorithms for ordered search in terms of a semidefinite program, we find new quantum algorithms for small instances of the ordered search problem. Extending these algorithms to arbitrarily large instances using recursion, we show that there is an exact quantum ordered search algorithm using 4 log_{605} N \approx 0.433 log_2 N queries, which improves upon the previously best known exact algorithm.

<blockquote>
<p>
Let us consider two quantum systems: system A and system B. Suppose that a classical information is encoded to quantum states of the system A and we distribute this information to both systems by making them interact with each other. We show that it is impossible to achieve this goal perfectly if the strength of interaction between the quantum systems is smaller than a quantity that is determined by noncommutativity between a Hamiltonian of the system A and the states (density operators) used for the information encoding. It is a consequence of a generalized Winger-Araki-Yanase theorem which enables us to treat conserved quantities other than additive ones.

<p>
The dynamics of the population imbalance of bosons in a double-well potential is investigated from the point of view of many-body quantum mechanics in the framework of the two-mode model. For small initial population imbalances, coherent superpositions of almost equally spaced energy eigenstates lead to Josephson oscillations. The suppression of tunneling at population imbalance beyond a critical value is related to a high concentration of initial state population in the region of the energy spectrum with quasi-degenerate doublets resulting in imbalance oscillations with a very small amplitude. For unaccessible long times, however, the system recovers the regime of Josephson oscillations.

In general the calculation of robustness of entanglement for the mixed entangled quantum states is rather difficult to handle analytically. Using the the convex semi-definite programming method, the robustness of entanglement of some mixed entangled quantum states such as: $2\otimes 2$ Bell decomposable (BD) states, a generic two qubit state in Wootters basis, iso-concurrence decomposable states, $2\otimes 3$ Bell decomposable states, $d\otimes d$ Werner and isotropic states, a one parameter $3\otimes 3$ state and finally multi partite isotropic state, is calculated exactly, where thus obtained results are in agreement with those of :$2\otimes 2$ density matrices, already calculated by one of the authors in \cite{Bell1,Rob3}. Also an analytic expression is given for separable states that wipe out all entanglement and it is further shown that they are on the boundary of separable states as pointed out in \cite{du}. {\bf Keywords: Robustness of entanglement, Semi-definite programming, Bell decomposable states, Werner and isotropic states.}
