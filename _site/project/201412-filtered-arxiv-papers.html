    <p><strong>1.    Notes on Deterministic Programming of Quantum Observables and Channels</strong><br>
Teiko Heinosaari, Mikko Tukiainen<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0419">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0419</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the limitations of deterministic programmability of quantum circuits, e.g., quantum computer. More precisely, we analyse the programming of quantum observables and channels via quantum multimeters. We show that the programming vectors for any two different sharp observables are necessarily orthogonal, whenever post-processing is not allowed. This result then directly implies that also any two different unitary channels require orthogonal programming vectors. This approach generalizes the well-known orthogonality result first proven by Nielsen and Chuang. In addition, we give size-bounds for a multimeter to be efficient in quantum programming.

<p><strong>2.    N00N states from a single non-linear directional coupler</strong><br>
Regina Kruse, Linda Sansoni, Sebastian Brauner, Raimund Ricken, Craig S. Hamilton, Igor Jex, Christine Silberhorn<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0448">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0448</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the quest for applicable quantum information technology miniaturised, compact and scalable sources are of paramount importance. Here, we present the concept for the generation of 2-photon N00N states without further post-processing in a single non-linear optical element. Based upon a periodically poled waveguide coupler, we present the principle of state generation via type-0 parametric down-conversion inside this type of devices. With the eigenmode description of the linear optical element, we utilise the delocalised photon pair generation to generate a N00N state in the measurement basis. We show, that we are able to eliminate the need for narrow-band spectral filtering, as well as for phase-stabilisation of the pump light, making this approach an elegant way to produce 2-photon N00N states.

<p><strong>3.    Physics of Spectral Singularities</strong><br>
Ali Mostafazadeh<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0454">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0454</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Spectral singularities are certain points of the continuous spectrum of generic complex scattering potentials. We review the recent developments leading to the discovery of their physical meaning, consequences, and generalizations. In particular, we give a simple definition of spectral singularities, provide a general introduction to spectral consequences of ${\cal PT}$-symmetry (clarifying some of the controversies surrounding this subject), outline the main ideas and constructions used in the pseudo-Hermitian representation of quantum mechanics, and discuss how spectral singularities entered in the physics literature as obstructions to these constructions. We then review the transfer matrix formulation of scattering theory and the application of complex scattering potentials in optics. These allow us to elucidate the physical content of spectral singularities and describe their optical realizations. Finally, we survey some of the most important results obtained in the subject, drawing special attention to the remarkable fact that the condition of the existence of linear and nonlinear optical spectral singularities yield simple mathematical derivations of some of the basic results of laser physics, namely the laser threshold condition and the linear dependence of the laser output intensity on the gain coefficient.

<p><strong>4.    Analysis of Photonic Quantum Nodes Based on Deterministic One-Photon Raman Interaction</strong><br>
Serge Rosenblum, Barak Dayan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0604">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0604</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The long-standing goal of deterministically controlling a single photon using another was recently realized in various experimental settings. Among these, a particularly attractive demonstration relied on deterministic one-photon Raman interaction in a three-level Lambda system coupled to a single-mode waveguide. Beyond the ability to control the direction of propagation of one photon by the direction of another photon, this scheme can also perform as a passive quantum memory and a universal quantum gate. Relying on interference, this all-optical, coherent scheme requires no additional control fields, and can therefore form the basis for scalable quantum networks composed of passive quantum nodes that interact with each other only with single photon pulses. Here we present an analytical and numerical study of deterministic one-photon Raman interaction, and characterise its limitations and the parameters for optimal operation. Specifically, we study the effect of losses and the presence of multiple excited states. In both cases we discuss strategies for restoring the high fidelity of the device&#39;s operation.

<p><strong>5.    A black potential for spin less particles</strong><br>
Ananya Ghatak, Mohammad Hasan, Bhabani Prasad Mandal<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0787">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0787</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the most general non-Hermitian Hulthen potential to study the scattering of spin-less relativistic particles. The conditions for CC, SS and CPA are obtained analytically for this potential. We show that almost total absorption occurs for entire range of incidence energy for certain parameter ranges of the potential and hence term this as `black potential&#39;. Time reversed of the same potential shows perfect emission for the entire range of particle energy. We also present the classical analog of this potential in terms of waveguide cross section.

<p><strong>6.    Bounding the set of finite dimensional quantum correlations</strong><br>
Miguel Navascues, Tamas Vertesi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0924">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0924</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a simple method to derive high performance semidefinite programming relaxations for optimizations over complex and real operator algebras in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. The method is very flexible, easy to program and allows the user to assess the behavior of finite dimensional quantum systems in a number of interesting setups. We use this method to bound the strength of quantum nonlocality in bipartite and tripartite Bell scenarios where the dimension of a subset of the parties is bounded from above. We derive new results in quantum communication complexity and prove the soundness of the prepare-and-measure dimension witnesses introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 230501 (2010)]. Finally, we propose a new dimension witness that can distinguish between classical, real and complex two-level systems.

<p><strong>7.    Perfect quantum state transfer of hard-core bosons on weighted path graphs</strong><br>
Steven J. Large, Michael S. Underwood, David L. Feder<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 032319 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1022">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1022</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to accurately transfer quantum information through networks is an important primitive in distributed quantum systems. While perfect quantum state transfer (PST) can be effected by a single particle undergoing continuous-time quantum walks on a variety of graphs, it is not known if PST persists for many particles in the presence of interactions. We show that if single-particle PST occurs on one-dimensional weighted path graphs, then systems of hard-core bosons undergoing quantum walks on these paths also undergo PST. The analysis extends the Tonks-Girardeau ansatz to weighted graphs using techniques in algebraic graph theory. The results suggest that hard-core bosons do not generically undergo PST, even on graphs which exhibit single-particle PST.

<p><strong>8.    Investigating graph isomorphism in cospectral graphs via multiparticle quantum walk in fermionic basis and entanglement entropy</strong><br>
M. A. Jafarizadeh, F. Eghbalifam, S. Nami<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1329">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1329</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the graph isomorphism (GI) in some cospectral networks. Two graph are isomorphic when they are related to each other by a relabeling of the graph vertices. We want to investigate the GI in two scalable (n + 2)-regular graphs G4(n; n + 2) and G5(n; n + 2), analytically by using the multiparticle quantum walk. These two graphs are a pair of non-isomorphic connected cospectral regular graphs for any positive integer n. In order to investigation GI in these two graphs, we rewrite the adjacency matrices of graphs in the antisymmetric fermionic basis and show that they are different for thesepairs of graphs. So the multiparticle quantum walk is able to distinguish pairs of non- isomorph graphs. Also we construct two new graphs T4(n; n + 2) and T5(n; n + 2) and repeat the same process of G4 and G5 to study the GI problem by using multiparticle quantum walk. Then we study GI by using the entanglement entropy. To this aim, we calculate entanglement entropy between two parts of network. In our model the nodes are considered as identical quantum harmonic oscillators. The entanglement entropy between two special parts of G4(n; n+2) and G5(n; n+2) are calculated analytically. It is shown that the entanglement entropy can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic cospectral graphs too.

<p>
We investigate the properties of co-propagating twin beams created by parametric downconversion in a ridge Bragg-reflection waveguide. Our source is bright and efficient although the tightly confined waveguide modes are not perfectly compatible with standard single-mode fibre optics. We observe the coalesce of the twin beams and investigate the effect of the multi-photon contributions on the observed photon bunching. Our source shows a great potential for producing indistinguishable photon pairs as well as multi-photon states.

<p><strong>10.    Experimental realization of a single qubit SIC POVM on via a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2355">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2355</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurement (SIC-POVM) is one important class of quantum measurement which is crucial for various quantum information processing tasks. SIC-POVMs have the advantage of providing an unbiased estimator for quantum states with the minimal number of outcomes needed for full tomography. We present an experimental approach on a photonic quantum walk which can be used to implement SIC-POVMs on a single-qbubit. The projection measurements of single-photons&#39; positions correspond to elements of SIC-POVM on the polarization of single-photons.

<p><strong>11.    Linear optical demonstration of quantum speed-up with a single qudit</strong><br>
Xiang Zhan, Jian Li, Hao Qin, Zhihao Bian, Peng Xue<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2357">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2357</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Though quantum algorithm acts as an important role in quantum computation science, not only for providing a great vision for solving classically unsolvable problems, but also due to the fact that it gives a potential way of understanding quantum physics, the origin of the power of quantum algorithm is still an open question. Non-classical correlation is regarded as the most possible answer for the open question. However we experimentally realize a quantum speed-up algorithm on four-level system with linear optical elements and prove that even a single qudit is enough for designing an oracle-based algorithm which can solve a model problem twice faster than any classical algorithm. The algorithm can be generalized to higher dimensional qudits with the same two-to-one speed-up ratio.

<p><strong>12.    Boson Sampling is Robust to Small Errors in the Network Matrix</strong><br>
Alex Arkhipov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2516">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2516</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the robustness of BosonSampling to imperfections in the linear optical network that cause a small deviation in the matrix it implements. We show that applying a noisy matrix $\tilde{U}$ that is within $\epsilon$ of the desired matrix $U$ in operator norm leads to an output distribution that is within $\epsilon n$ of the desired distribution in variation distance, where $n$ is the number of photons. This lets us derive a sufficient tolerance each beamsplitters and phaseshifters in the network. This result considers only errors that result from the network encoding a different unitary than desired, and not other sources of noise such as photon loss and partial distinguishability.

<p><strong>13.    Classical Analysis of Degenerate Optomechanical Parametric Oscillators</strong><br>
Fernando Jiménez, Carlos Navarrete-Benlloch<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2521">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2521</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent advances in the miniaturization of whispering gallery mode optical parametric oscillators have open the possibility of studying the interplay between parametric down-conversion and optomechanics, two of the most fundamental nonlinear optical processes. Even though a rigorous analysis of this scenario requires a fully quantum mechanical treatment where, e.g., the squeezing of the down-converted field or the cooling of the mechanical degree of freedom can be studied, having a clear idea of the classical properties of the system is useful or even necessary before starting such quantum mechanical analysis, and this is precisely what we offer in this work. We will restrict to the case of degenerate parametric down-conversion, obtaining then what we call a degenerate optomechanical parametric oscillator.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3186">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3186</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a useful connection exists between spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and sum frequency generation in nonlinear optical waveguides with arbitrary scattering loss, while the same does not hold true for SPDC and difference frequency generation. This result deepens the relationship between quantum and classical second-order nonlinear optical processes in waveguides, and identifies the most accurate characterization of their quantum performance in the presence of loss based solely on classical measurements.

<p><strong>16.    Non-Markovianity hinders Quantum Darwinism</strong><br>
F. Galve, R. Zambrini, S. Maniscalco<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3316">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3316</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this Letter we investigate Quantum Darwinism and the emergence of a classical world from the quantum one in connection with the spectral properties of the environment. We use a microscopic model of quantum environment in which, by changing a simple system parameter, we can modify the information back flow from environment into the system, and therefore its non-Markovian character. We show that the presence of memory effects hinders the emergence of classical objective reality. We conjecture that this phenomenon is connected to the absence of a measurement-scheme interpretation for quantum trajectories in the non-Markovian regime.

<p><strong>17.    The ubiquitous problem of learning system parameters for dissipative two-level quantum systems: Fourier analysis versus Bayesian estimation</strong><br>
Sophie Schirmer, Frank Langbein<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4282">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4282</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare the accuracy, precision and reliability of different methods for estimating key system parameters for two-level systems subject to Hamiltonian evolution and decoherence. It is demonstrated that the use of Bayesian modelling and maximum likelihood estimation is superior to common techniques based on Fourier analysis. Even for simple two-parameter estimation problems, the Bayesian approach yields higher accuracy and precision for the parameter estimates obtained. It requires less data, is more flexible in dealing with different model systems, can deal better with uncertainty in initial conditions and measurements, and enables adaptive refinement of the estimates. The comparison results shows that this holds for measurements of large ensembles of spins and atoms limited by Gaussian noise as well as projection noise limited data from repeated single-shot measurements of a single quantum device.

A new family of 2D discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is presented and shown to coincide, in the continuous limit, with the Dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and homogeneous magnetic field. Landau levels are constructed, not only in the continuous limit, but also for the DTQWs i.e. for finite non-vanishing values of the time- and position-steps. All results are supported by numerical simulations. The possibility of quantum simulation of condensed matter systems by DTQWs is also discussed.

We describe a simple, efficient method for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics on a quantum computer by approximating the truncated Taylor series of the evolution operator. Our method can simulate the time evolution of a wide variety of physical systems.

However, we simplify the algorithm and its analysis by using a method for implementing linear combinations of unitary operations to directly apply the truncated Taylor series.

In this work we aim at proving central limit theorems for open quantum walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We study the case when there are various classes of vertices in the network.

Secondly, we assign each vertex a random class with a uniform distribution. For each way of distributing vertex classes, we obtain an appropriate central limit theorem, illustrated by numerical examples. These theorems may have application in the study of complex systems in quantum biology and dissipative quantum computation.

<blockquote>
<p>
Walk-off effects, originating from the difference between the group and phase velocities, limit the efficiency of nonlinear optical interactions. While transverse walk-off can be eliminated by proper medium engineering, longitudinal walk-off is harder to avoid. In particular, ultrafast twin- beam generation via pulsed parametric down-conversion (PDC) and four-wave mixing (FWM) is only possible in short crystals or fibres or in double-path schemes. Here we show that in high-gain PDC, one can overcome the destructive role of both effects and even turn them into useful tools for shaping the emission. In our experiment, one of the twin beams is emitted along the pump Poynting vector or its group velocity matches that of the pump. The result is dramatically enhanced generation of both twin beams, with the simultaneous narrowing of angular and frequency spectrum. The effect will enable efficient generation of ultrafast twin photons and beams in cavities, waveguides, and whispering-gallery mode resonators.

<blockquote>
<p>
Enabled by rapidly developing quantum technologies, it is possible to network quantum systems at a much larger scale in the near future. To deal with non-Markovian dynamics that is prevalent in solid-state devices, we propose a general transfer function based framework for modeling linear quantum networks, in which signal flow graphs are applied to characterize the network topology by flow of quantum signals. We define a noncommutative ring $\mathbb{D}$ and use its elements to construct Hamiltonians, transformations and transfer functions for both active and passive systems. The signal flow graph obtained for direct and indirect coherent quantum feedback systems clearly show the feedback loop via bidirectional signal flows. Importantly, the transfer function from input to output field is derived for non-Markovian quantum systems with colored inputs, from which the Markovian input-output relation can be easily obtained as a limiting case. Moreover, the transfer function possesses a symmetry structure that is analogous to the well-know scattering transformation in \sd picture. Finally, we show that these transfer functions can be integrated to build complex feedback networks via interconnections, serial products and feedback, which may include either direct or indirect coherent feedback loops, and transfer functions between quantum signal nodes can be calculated by the Riegle&#39;s matrix gain rule. The theory paves the way for modeling, analyzing and synthesizing non-Markovian linear quantum feedback networks in the frequency-domain.

We investigate the geometric phase of a two-level atom (qubit) coupled to a bosonic reservoir with Lorentzian spectral density, and find that for the non-Markovian dynamics in which rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is performed, geometric phase has a $\pi$-phase jump at the nodal point. However, the exact result without RWA given by hierarchy equation of motion method shows that there is no such a phase jump or nodal structure in geometric phase. Thus our results demonstrate that the counter-rotating terms significantly contribute to the geometric phase in multi-mode Hamiltonian under certain circumstances.

<blockquote>
<p>
The realization of an ultra-fast source of heralded single photons emitted at the wavelength of 1540 nm is reported. The presented strategy is based on state-of-the-art telecom technology, combined with off-the-shelf fiber components and waveguide non-linear stages pumped by a 10 GHz repetition rate laser. The single photons are heralded at a rate as high as 2.1 MHz with a heralding efficiency of 42%. Single photon character of the source is inferred by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function. For the highest heralding rate, a value as low as 0.023 is found. This not only proves negligible multi-photon contributions but also represents the best measured value reported to date for heralding rates in the MHz regime. These prime performances, associated with a device-like configuration, are key ingredients for both fast and secure quantum communication protocols.

<blockquote>
<p>
The optimal properties for single photons may vary drastically between different quantum technologies. Along with central frequency conversion, control over photonic temporal waveforms will be paramount to the effective coupling of different quantum systems and efficient distribution of quantum information. Through the application of pulse shaping and the nonlinear optical process of sum-frequency generation, we examine a framework for manipulation of single-photon waveforms. We use a non-perturbative treatment to determine the parameter regime in which both high-efficiency and high-fidelity conversion may be achieved for Gaussian waveforms and study the effect such conversion techniques have on energy-time entanglement. Additionally, we prove that aberrations due to time ordering are negligible when the phasematching is nonrestrictive over the input bandwidths. Our calculations show that ideal quantum optical waveform conversion and quantum time lensing may be fully realized using these techniques.

<p>
A systematic procedure to extract classical degrees of freedom in quantum mechanics is formulated using the stochastic variational method. With this classicalization, a hybrid model constructed from quantum and classical variables (quantum-classical hybrids) is derived systematically. In this procedure, conservation laws such as energy are maintained, and Eherefest`s theorem is still satisfied with modification. The criterion for the applicability of quantum-classical hybrids is also investigated.

Two photons can simultaneously share entanglement between several degrees of freedom such as polarization, energy-time, spatial mode and orbital angular momentum. This resource is known as hyperentanglement, and it has been shown to be an important tool for optical quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate the quantum storage and retrieval of photonic hyperentanglement in a solid-state quantum memory. A pair of photons entangled in polarization and energy-time is generated such that one photon is stored in the quantum memory, while the other photon has a telecommunication wavelength suitable for transmission in optical fibre. We measured violations of a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality for each degree of freedom, independently of the other one, which proves the successful storage and retrieval of the two bits of entanglement shared by the photons. Our scheme is compatible with long-distance quantum communication in optical fibre, and is in particular suitable for linear-optical entanglement purification for quantum repeaters.

<p>
We explore the space &quot;just above&quot; BQP by defining a complexity class PDQP (Product Dynamical Quantum Polynomial time) which is larger than BQP but does not contain NP relative to an oracle. The class is defined by imagining that quantum computers can perform measurements that do not collapse the wavefunction. This (non-physical) model of computation can efficiently solve problems such as Graph Isomorphism and Approximate Shortest Vector which are believed to be intractable for quantum computers. Furthermore, it can search an unstructured N-element list in $\tilde O$(N^{1/3}) time, but no faster than {\Omega}(N^{1/4}), and hence cannot solve NP-hard problems in a black box manner. In short, this model of computation is more powerful than standard quantum computation, but only slightly so. Our work is inspired by previous work of Aaronson on the power of sampling the histories of hidden variables. However Aaronson&#39;s work contains an error in its proof of the lower bound for search, and hence it is unclear whether or not his model allows for search in logarithmic time. Our work can be viewed as a conceptual simplification of Aaronson&#39;s approach, with a provable polynomial lower bound for search.

Pure quantum states play a central role in applications of quantum information, both as initial states for many algorithms and as resources for quantum error correction. Preparation of highly pure states that satisfy the threshold for quantum error correction remains a challenge, not only for ensemble implementations like NMR or ESR but also for other technologies. Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling is a method to increase the purity of set of qubits coupled to a bath. We investigated the achievable polarization by analyzing the state when no more entropy can be extracted. In particular we give an analytic form for the maximum polarization of the purified qubit and corresponding state of the whole system for the case when the initial state of the qubits is totally mixed. It is however possible to reach higher polarization while starting with other states with higher polarization, thus our result provides an achievable lower bound. We also give an upper bound of the number of steps needed to get a certain required polarization.

<p>
This PhD thesis is dedicated to the study of the interplay between symmetries of quantum states and their self-similar properties. It consists of three connected threads of research: polynomial invariants for multiphoton states, visualization schemes for quantum many-body systems and a complex networks approach to quantum walks on a graph. First, we study the problem of which many-photon states are equivalent up to the action of passive linear optics. We prove that it can be converted into the problem of equivalence of two permutation-symmetric states, not necessarily restricted to the same operation on all parties. We show that the problem can be formulated in terms of symmetries of complex polynomials of many variables, and provide two families of invariants, which are straightforward to compute and provide analytical results. Second, we study a family of recursive visualization schemes for many-particle systems, for which we have coined the name &#39;qubism&#39;. While all many-qudit states can be plotted with qubism, it is especially useful for spin chains and one-dimensional translationally invariant states. This symmetry results in self-similarity of the plot, making it more comprehensible and allowing to discover certain structures. Third, we study quantum walks of a single particle on graphs, which are classical analogues of random walks. Our focus is on the long-time limit of the probability distribution and we study how (especially in the long-time limit) off-diagonal elements of the density matrix behave. We use them to perform quantum community detection - splitting of a graph into subgraphs in such a way that the coherence between them is small. Our method captures properties that classical methods cannot - the impact of constructive and destructive interference, as well as the dependence of the results on the tunneling phase.

<p>
Lazy quantum walks were presented by Andrew M. Childs to prove that the continuous-time quantum walk is a limit of the discrete-time quantum walk [Commun.Math.Phys.294,581-603(2010)]. In this paper, we discuss properties of lazy quantum walks. Our analysis shows that lazy quantum walks have $O(t^n)$ order of the n-th moment of the corresponding probability distribution, which is the same as that for normal quantum walks. Also, the lazy quantum walk with DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) coin operator has a similar probability distribution concentrated interval to that of the normal Hadamard quantum walk. Most importantly, we introduce the concepts of occupancy number and occupancy rate to measure the extent to which the walk has a (relatively) high probability at every position in its range. We conclude that lazy quantum walks have a higher occupancy rate than other walks such as normal quantum walks, classical walks and lazy classical walks.

We describe and analyze leakage errors of singlet-triplet qubits. Even though leakage errors are a natural problem for spin qubits encoded using quantum dot arrays, they have obtained little attention in previous studies. We describe the realization of leakage correction protocols that can be implemented together with the quantum error correction protocol of the surface code. Furthermore we construct explicit leakage reduction units that need, in the ideal setup, as few as three manipulation steps. Our study shows that leakage errors can be corrected without the need of measurements and at the cost of only a few additional ancilla qubits and gate operations compared to standard quantum error correction codes.

<p>
Continuous time quantum walks provide an important framework for designing new algorithms and modelling quantum transport and state transfer problems. Often, the graph representing the structure of a problem contains certain symmetries which confine the dynamics to a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. In this work, we use a systematic method to compute the reduced set of states that encompass the dynamics of the problem at hand without the specific knowledge of underlying symmetries. First, we apply this method to obtain new instances of graphs where the spatial quantum search algorithm is optimal: complete graphs with broken links and complete bipartite graphs. These examples show that regularity and high-connectivity are not needed to achieve optimal spatial search. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time optimal quantum search on a planar structure, namely the star graph. We also show that this method considerably simplifies the calculation of quantum transport efficiencies. Furthermore, we observe improved efficiencies by removing a few links from highly symmetric graphs. Finally, we show that this reduction method also allows us to obtain an upper bound for the fidelity of a single qubit transfer on an XY spin network.

The Tsallis and R\&#39;enyi entropies are important quantities in the information theory, statistics and related fields because the Tsallis entropy is an one parameter generalization of the Shannon entropy and the R\&#39;enyi entropy includes several useful entropy measures such as the Shannon entropy, Min-entropy and so on, as special choices of its parameter. On the other hand, the discrete-time quantum walk plays important roles in various applications, for example, quantum speed-up algorithm and universal computation. In this paper, we show limiting behaviors of the Tsallis and R\&#39;enyi entropies for discrete-time quantum walks on the line which are starting from the origin and defined by arbitrary coin and initial state. The results show that the Tsallis entropy behaves in polynomial order of time with the parameter dependent exponent while the R\&#39;enyi entropy tends to infinity in logarithmic order of time independent of the choice of the parameter. Moreover, we show the difference between the R\&#39;enyi entropy and the logarithmic function characterizes by the R\&#39;enyi entropy of the limit distribution of the quantum walk. In addition, we show an example of asymptotic behavior of the conditional R\&#39;enyi entropies of the quantum walk.

<p>
We investigate the two-photon scattering properties of a Jaynes-Cummings (JC) nonlinearity consisting of a two-level system (qubit) interacting with a single mode cavity, which is coupled to two waveguides, each containing a single incident photon wave packet initially. In this scattering setup, we study the interplay between the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect arising due to quantum interference and effective photon-photon interactions induced by the presence of the qubit. We calculate the two-photon scattering matrix of this system analytically and identify signatures of interference and interaction in the second order auto- and cross-correlation functions of the scattered photons. In the dispersive regime, when qubit and cavity are far detuned from each other, we find that the JC nonlinearity can be used as an almost linear, in-situ tunable beam splitter giving rise to ideal Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, generating a highly path-entangled two-photon NOON state of the scattered photons. The latter manifests itself in strongly suppressed waveguide cross-correlations and Poissonian photon number statistics in each waveguide. If the two-level system and the cavity are on resonance, the JC nonlinearity strongly modifies the ideal HOM conditions leading to a smaller degree of path entanglement and sub-poissonian photon number statistics. In the latter regime, we find that photon blockade is associated with bunched auto-correlations in both waveguides, while a two-polariton resonance can lead to bunched as well as anti-bunched correlations.

A modification of the Tulsi quantum search algorithm with intermediate measurements of the control is presented. In order to analyze the effect of measurements in quantum searches, a different choice of the angular parameter is used. The study is performed for several values of time lapses between measurements, finding close relationships between probabilities and correlations (Mutual Information and Cumulative Correlation Measure). The order of this modified algorithm is estimated, showing that for some time lapses the performance is improved, and became of order $O(N)$ (classical brute force search) when the measurement is taken in every step. The results indicate a possible way to analyze improvements to other quantum algorithms using one, or more, control qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum trajectory (QT) theory, which is broadly utilized nowadays in quantum measurement and control studies, essentially corresponds to unraveling of the Lindblad master equation. However, the QT theory of this type is not compatible with quantum Zeno effect. In this work we propose a scheme for the quantum trajectories conditioned on frequent measurements in non-Markovian environment. The non-Markovian environment is characterized by a finite bandwidth ($\Lambda$), which we show has a perfect &quot;scaling&quot; property with the measurement frequency ($1/\tau$). As a result, the incompatibility between the QT theory and the Zeno effect can be naturally eliminated. The new QT theory tells us that the scaling variable $x=\Lambda \tau$ is an important parameter that should be taken into account. The present study sheds also new light on the confusing concept of continuous null-result informational evolution.

<blockquote>
<p>
In order to implement fault-tolerant quantum computation, entanglement generation with low error probability and high success probability is required. We have proposed the use of squeezed coherent light as a probe to generate entanglement between two atoms by communication, and shown that the error probability is reduced well below the threshold of fault-tolerant quantum computation [Phys. Rev. A. {\bf 88}, 022313 (2013)]. Here, we investigate the effect of photon loss mainly due to finite coupling efficiency to the cavity. The error probability with the photon loss is calculated by the beam-splitter model for homodyne measurement on probe light. Optimum condition on the amplitude of probe light to minimize the error probability is examined. It is shown that the phase-squeezed probe light yields lower error probability than coherent-light probe. A fault-tolerant quantum computation algorithm can be implemented under 0.59 dB loss by concatenating five-qubit error correction code.

Nonlinear optical phenomena are typically local. Here we predict the possibility of highly nonlocal optical nonlinearities for light propagating in atomic media trapped near a nano-waveguide, where long-range interactions between the atoms can be tailored. When the atoms are in an electromagnetically-induced transparency configuration, the atomic interactions are translated to long-range interactions between photons and thus to highly nonlocal optical nonlinearities. We derive and analyze the governing nonlinear propagation equation, finding a roton-like excitation spectrum for light and the emergence of long-range order in its output intensity. These predictions open the door to studies of unexplored wave dynamics and many-body physics with highly-nonlocal interactions of optical fields in one dimension.

<p>
Quantum computers are expected to be more efficient in performing certain computations than any classical machine. Unfortunately, the technological challenges associated with building a full-scale quantum computer have not yet allowed the experimental verification of such an expectation. Recently, boson sampling has emerged as a problem that is suspected to be intractable on any classical computer, but efficiently implementable with a linear quantum optical setup. Therefore, boson sampling may offer an experimentally realizable challenge to the Extended Church-Turing thesis and this remarkable possibility motivated much of the interest around boson sampling, at least in relation to complexity-theoretic questions. In this work, we show that the successful development of a boson sampling apparatus would not only answer such inquiries, but also yield a practical tool for difficult molecular computations. Specifically, we show that a boson sampling device with a modified input state can be used to generate molecular vibronic spectra, including complicated effects such as Duschinsky rotations.

The spectrum width can be narrowed to a certain degree by decreasing the coupling strength for the two-level emitter coupled to the propagating surface plasmon.

Here we propose a new scheme to construct a narrow-band source via a one-dimensional waveguide coupling with a three-level emitter. It is shown that the reflective spectrum width can be narrowed avoiding the impact of the loss. This approach opens up the possibility of plasmonic ultranarrow single-photon source.

Polarizing nuclear spins is of fundamental importance in biology, chemistry and physics. Methods for hyperpolarizing 13C nuclei from free electrons in bulk, usually demand operation at cryogenic temperatures. Room-temperature approaches targeting diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers could alleviate this need, but hitherto proposed strategies lack generality as they demand stringent conditions on the strength and/or alignment of the magnetic field. We report here an approach for achieving efficient electron-&gt;13C spin alignment transfers, compatible with a broad range of magnetic field strengths and field orientations with respect to the diamond crystal. This versatility results from combining coherent microwave- and incoherent laser-induced transitions between selected energy states of the coupled electron-nuclear spin manifold. 13C-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments demonstrate that this hyperpolarization can be transferred via first-shell or via distant 13Cs, throughout the nuclear bulk ensemble. This method opens new perspectives for applications of diamond NV centers in NMR, and in quantum information processing.

We analyze a chain of coupled nonlinear optical cavities driven by a coherent source of light localized at one end and subject to uniform dissipation. We characterize photon transport by studying the populations and the photon correlations as a function of position. When complemented with input-output theory, these quantities provide direct information about photon transmission through the system. The position of single- and multi-photon resonances directly reflect the structure of the many-body energy levels. This shows how a study of transport along a coupled cavity array can provide rich information about the strongly correlated (many-body) states of light even in presence of dissipation. By means of a numerical algorithm based on the time-evolving block decimation scheme adapted to mixed states, we are able to simulate arrays up to sixty cavities.

Atom interferometers have a multitude of proposed applications in space including precise measurements of the Earth&#39;s gravitational field, in navigation &amp; ranging, and in fundamental physics such as tests of the weak equivalence principle (WEP) and gravitational wave detection. While atom interferometers are realized routinely in ground-based laboratories, current efforts aim at the development of a space compatible design optimized with respect to dimensions, weight, power consumption, mechanical robustness and radiation hardness. In this paper, we present a design of a high-sensitivity differential dual species $^{85}$Rb/$^{87}$Rb atom interferometer for space, including physics package, laser system, electronics and software. The physics package comprises the atom source consisting of dispensers and a 2D magneto-optical trap (MOT), the science chamber with a 3D-MOT, a magnetic trap based on an atom chip and an optical dipole trap (ODT) used for Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) creation and interferometry, the detection unit, the vacuum system for $10^{-11}$ mbar ultra-high vacuum generation, and the high-suppression factor magnetic shielding as well as the thermal control system. The laser system is based on a hybrid approach using fiber-based telecom components and high-power laser diode technology and includes all laser sources for 2D-MOT, 3D-MOT, ODT, interferometry and detection. Manipulation and switching of the laser beams is carried out on an optical bench using Zerodur bonding technology. The instrument consists of 9 units with an overall mass of 221 kg, an average power consumption of 608 W (819 W peak), and a volume of 470 liters which would well fit on a satellite to be launched with a Soyuz rocket, as system studies have shown.

<p>
Low-temperature characters of superconducting devices yield definite probes for different superconducting phenomena. We study the macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in a Josephson junction, composed of a single-gap superconductor and a two-gap superconductor. Since this junction has two kinds to the superconducting phase differences, calculating the MQT escape rate requires the analysis of quantum tunneling in a multi-dimensional configuration space. Our approach is the semi-classical approximation along a 1D curve in a 2D potential- energy landscape, connecting two adjacent potential (local) minimums through a saddle point. We find that this system has two plausible tunneling paths; an in-phase path and an out-of-phase path. The former is characterized by the Josephson-plasma frequency, whereas the latter is by the frequency of the characteristic collective mode in a two-band superconductor, Josephson- Leggett mode. Depending on external bias current and inter-band Josephson-coupling energy, one of them mainly contributes to the MQT. Our numerical calculations show that the difference between the in-phase path and the out-of-phase path is manifest, with respect to the bias- current-dependence of the MQT escape rate. This result suggests that our MQT setting be an indicator of the Josephson-Leggett mode.

<blockquote>
<p>
The treatment of high-dimensional problems such as the Schr\&quot;odinger equation can be approached by concepts of tensor product approximation. We present general techniques that can be used for the treatment of high-dimensional optimization tasks and time-dependent equations, and connect them to concepts already used in many-body quantum physics. Based on achievements from the past decade, entanglement-based methods, -- developed from different perspectives for different purposes in distinct communities already matured to provide a variety of tools -- can be combined to attack highly challenging problems in quantum chemistry. The aim of the present paper is to give a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical background of this novel field and demonstrate the underlying benefits through numerical applications on a text book example. Among the various optimization tasks we will discuss only those which are connected to a controlled manipulation of the entanglement which is in fact the key ingredient of the methods considered in the paper. The selected topics will be covered according to a series of lectures given on the topic &quot;New wavefunction methods and entanglement optimizations in quantum chemistry&quot; at the Workshop on Theoretical Chemistry, 18 - 21 February 2014, Mariapfarr, Austria.

<p><strong>54.    Chains with loops - synthetic magnetic fluxes and topological order in one-dimensional spin systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering topological quantum order has become a major field of physics. Many advances have been made by synthesizing gauge fields in cold atomic systems. Here, we carry over these developments to other platforms which are extremely well suited for quantum engineering, namely trapped ions and nano-trapped atoms. Since these systems are typically one-dimensional, the action of artificial magnetic fields has so far received little attention. However, exploiting the long-range nature of interactions, loops with non-vanishing magnetic fluxes become possible even in one-dimensional settings. This gives rise to intriguing phenomena, such as fractal energy spectra, flat bands with localized edge states, and topological many-body states. We elaborate on a simple scheme for generating the required artificial fluxes by periodically driving an XY spin chain. Concrete estimates demonstrating the experimental feasibility for trapped ions and atoms in waveguides are given.

<blockquote>
<p>
Pure and bright single photon sources have recently been obtained by inserting solid-state emitters in photonic nanowires or microcavities. The cavity approach presents the attractive possibility to greatly increase the source operation frequency. However, it is perceived as technologically demanding because the emitter resonance must match the cavity resonance. Here we show that the spectral matching requirement is actually strongly lifted by the intrinsic coupling of the emitter to its environment. A single photon source consisting of a single InGaAs quantum dot inserted in a micropillar cavity is studied. Phonon coupling results in a large Purcell effect even when the quantum dot is detuned from the cavity resonance. The phonon-assisted cavity enhanced emission is shown to be a good single-photon source, with a brightness exceeding $40$ \% for a detuning range covering 15 cavity linewidths.

<blockquote>
<p>
Work, moments of work and heat flux are studied for the generic case of a strongly driven twolevel system immersed in a bosonic heat bath in domains of parameter space where perturbative treatments fail. This includes particularly the interplay between non-Markovian dynamics and moderate to strong external driving. Exact data are compared with predictions from weak coupling approaches. Further, the role of system-bath correlations in the initial thermal state and their impact on the heat flux are addressed. The relevance of these results for current experimental activities on solid state devices is discussed.

<p><strong>57.    Low Loss Light Feld Modes in Nano Planar Waveguide: An Analytical Approach Based on the Rytov-Leontovich Boundary Conditions</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We develop an analytical approach based on the Rytov-Leontovich boundary conditions to study light field modes in the nano planar waveguides. The analytical results thus obtained demonstrate new conditions for optical low loss surface plasmon-polariton modes in the planar waveguides with dielectric-metamaterial interfaces. The obtained results are confirmed with existing numerical calcultions. More general conditions for using the proposed analytical approach to study light field in the nano waveguides are also considered.

<p><strong>58.    Squash: A Scalable Quantum Mapper Considering Ancilla Sharing</strong><br>
Mohammad Javad Dousti, Alireza Shafaei, Massoud Pedram<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum algorithms for solving problems of interesting size often result in circuits with a very large number of qubits and quantum gates. Fortunately, these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of quantum kernels- each kernel comprises k parts such that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores. Experimental results demonstrate that Squash can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
This volume contains the proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2014), which was held from the 4th to the 6th of June, 2014, at Kyoto University, Japan. The goal of the QPL workshop series is to bring together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantic methods and other computer science methods for the study of physical behavior in general. Over the past few years, there has been growing activity in these foundational approaches, together with a renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream research in quantum computation. Earlier workshops in this series, with the same acronym under the name &quot;Quantum Programming Languages&quot;, were held in Ottawa (2003), Turku (2004), Chicago (2005), and Oxford (2006). The first QPL under the new name Quantum Physics and Logic was held in Reykjavik (2008), followed by Oxford (2009 and 2010), Nijmegen (2011), Brussels (2012) and Barcelona (2013).

<p><strong>60.    Semantics for a Quantum Programming Language by Operator Algebras</strong><br>
Kenta Cho<br>
EPTCS 172, 2014, pp. 165-190<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8545">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8545</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper presents a novel semantics for a quantum programming language by operator algebras, which are known to give a formulation for quantum theory that is alternative to the one by Hilbert spaces. We show that the opposite category of the category of W*-algebras and normal completely positive subunital maps is an elementary quantum flow chart category in the sense of Selinger. As a consequence, it gives a denotational semantics for Selinger&#39;s first-order functional quantum programming language QPL. The use of operator algebras allows us to accommodate infinite structures and to handle classical and quantum computations in a unified way.
