    <p><strong>1.    Continuous variable quantum key distribution in non-Markovian channels</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We address continuous variable quantum key distribution (QKD) in non-Markovian lossy channels and show how the non-Markovian features may be exploited to enhance security and/or to detect the presence and the position of an eavesdropper along the transmission line. In particular, we suggest a coherent states QKD protocol which is secure against individual attacks for arbitrarily low values of the overall transmission line. Our scheme relies on specific non-Markovian properties, and cannot be implemented in ordinary Markovian channels characterized by uniform losses.

<blockquote>
<p>
Large conditional phase shifts from coupled atom-cavity systems are a key requirement for building a spin photon interface. This in turn would allow the realisation of hybrid quantum information schemes using spin and photonic qubits. Here we perform high resolution reflection spectroscopy of a quantum dot resonantly coupled to a pillar microcavity. We show both the change in reflectivity as the quantum dot is tuned through the cavity resonance, and measure the conditional phase shift induced by the quantum dot using an ultra stable interferometer. These techniques could be extended to the study of charged quantum dots, where it would be possible to realise a spin photon interface.

<p><strong>3.    Effect of quasi-bound states on coherent electron transport in twisted nanowires</strong><br>
Giampaolo Cuoghi, Andrea Bertoni, Andrea Sacchetti<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0561">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0561</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum transmission spectra of a twisted electron waveguide expose the coupling between traveling and quasi-bound states. Through a direct numerical solution of the open-boundary Schr\&quot;odinger equation we single out the effects of the twist and show how the presence of a localized state leads to a Breit-Wigner or a Fano resonance in the transmission. We also find that the energy of quasi-bound states is increased by the twist, in spite of the constant section area along the waveguide. While the mixing of different transmission channels is expected to reduce the conductance, the shift of localized levels into the traveling-states energy range can reduce their detrimental effects on coherent transport.

<p><strong>4.    Open system quantum dynamics with correlated initial states, not completely positive maps and non-Markovianity</strong><br>
A. R. Usha Devi, A. K. Rajagopl, Sudha<br>
Physical Review A 83, 022109 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0621">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0621</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dynamical A and B maps have been employed extensively by Sudarshan and co-workers to investigate open system evolution of quantum systems. A canonical structure of the A-map is introduced here. It is shown that this canonical A-map enables us to investigate if the dynamics is completely positive (CP) or non-completely positive (NCP) in an elegant way and hence, it subsumes the basic results on open system dynamics. Identifying memory effects in open system evolution is gaining increasing importance recently and here, a criterion of non-Markovianity, based on the relative entropy of the dynamical state is proposed. The relative entropy difference of the dynamical system serves as a complementary characterization - though not related directly - to the fidelity difference criterion proposed recently. Three typical examples of open system evolution of a qubit, prepared initially in a correlated state with another qubit (environment), and evolving jointly under a specific unitary dynamics - which corresponds to a NCP dynamical map - are investigated by employing both the relative entropy difference and fidelity difference tests of non-Markovianity. The two qubit initial states are chosen to be (i) a pure entangled state, (ii) theWerner state, which exemplifies both entangled and separable states of qubits, depending on a real parameter, and (3) a separable mixed state. Both the relative entropy and fidelity criteria offer a nice display of how non-Markovianity manifests in all the three examples.

<blockquote>
<p>
Is it possible to trap a quantum particle in an open geometry? In this work we deal with the boundary value problem of the stationary Schroedinger (or Helmholtz) equation within a waveguide with straight segments and a rectangular bending. The problem can be reduced to a one dimensional matrix Schroedinger equation using two descriptions: oblique modes and conformal coordinates. We use a corner-corrected WKB formalism to find the energies of the one dimensional problem. It is shown that the presence of bound states is an effect due to the boundary alone, with no classical counterpart for this geometry. The conformal description proves to be simpler, as the coupling of transversal modes is not essential in this case.

<p><strong>6.    Open system approach to the internal dynamics of a model multilevel molecule</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1238">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1238</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A model multilevel molecule described by two sets of rotational internal energy levels of different parity and degenerate ground states, coupled by a constant interaction, is considered, by assuming that the random collisions in a gas of identical molecules, provoke transitions between adjacent energy levels of the same parity. The prescriptions of the continuous time quantum random walk are applied to the single molecule, interpreted as an open quantum system, and the master equation driving its internal dynamics is built for a general distribution of the waiting times between two consecutive collisions. The coherence terms and the populations of the energy levels relax to the asymptotics with inverse power laws for relevant classes of non-Poissonian distributions of the collision times. The stable asymptotic equilibrium configuration is independent of the distribution. The long time dynamics may be hindered by increasing the tail of the distribution density. This effect may be interpreted as the appearance of the quantum Zeno effect over long time scales.

We derive Fourier&#39;s law for a completely coherent quasi one--dimensional chaotic quantum system coupled locally to two heat baths at different temperatures. We solve the master equation to first order in the temperature difference. We show that the heat conductance can be expressed as a thermodynamic equilibrium coefficient taken at some intermediate temperature. We use that expression to show that for temperatures large compared to the mean level spacing of the system, the heat conductance is inversely proportional to the level density and, thus, inversely proportional to the length of the system.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum query complexity of minor-closed graph properties</strong><br>

Proc. 28th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2011), Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics 9, pp. 661-672<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the quantum query complexity of minor-closed graph properties, which include such problems as determining whether an $n$-vertex graph is planar, is a forest, or does not contain a path of a given length. We show that most minor-closed properties---those that cannot be characterized by a finite set of forbidden subgraphs---have quantum query complexity \Theta(n^{3/2}). To establish this, we prove an adversary lower bound using a detailed analysis of the structure of minor-closed properties with respect to forbidden topological minors and forbidden subgraphs. On the other hand, we show that minor-closed properties (and more generally, sparse graph properties) that can be characterized by finitely many forbidden subgraphs can be solved strictly faster, in o(n^{3/2}) queries. Our algorithms are a novel application of the quantum walk search framework and give improved upper bounds for several subgraph-finding problems.

<p><strong>10.    Dynamical Decoupling in the Presence of Realistic Pulse Errors</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1903">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1903</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most significant hurdles to be overcome on the path to practical quantum information processors is dealing with quantum errors. Dynamical decoupling is a particularly promising approach that complements conventional quantum error correction by eliminating some correlated errors without the overhead of additional qubits. In practice, the control pulses used for decoupling are imperfect and thus introduce errors which can accumulate after many pulses. These instrumental errors can destroy the quantum state. Here we examine several dynamical decoupling sequences, and their concatenated variants, using electron spin resonance of donor electron spins in a $^{28}$Si crystal. All of the sequences cancel phase noise arising from slowly fluctuating magnetic fields in our spectrometer, but only those sequences based upon alternating $\pi$-rotations about the X- and Y-axes in the rotating frame (XYXY sequences) demonstrate the ability to store an arbitrary quantum state. By comparing the experimental results with a detailed theoretical analysis we demonstrate that the superior performance of XYXY sequences arises from the fact that they are self-correcting for the dominant instrumental pulse errors in magnetic resonance experiments. We further find that concatenated sequences perform better than the periodic variants, maintaining near 100% fidelities for spin states even after several hundred control pulses. Intuitively, one would expect the instrumental error to increase with the number of pulses in the sequence but we show that the dominant first-order error does not increase when concatenating the XYXY sequence.

<blockquote>
<p>
Recurrence of a random walk is described by the Polya number. For quantum walks, recurrence is understood as the return of the walker to the origin, rather than the full-revival of its quantum state. Localization for two dimensional quantum walks is known to exist in the sense of non-vanishing probability distribution in the asymptotic limit. We show on the example of the 2-D Grover walk that one can exploit the effect of localization to construct stationary solutions. Moreover, we find full-revivals of a quantum state with a period of two steps. We prove that there cannot be longer cycles for a four-state quantum walk. Stationary states and revivals result from interference which has no counterpart in classical random walks.

<p><strong>12.    Noise Thresholds for Higher Dimensional Systems using the Discrete Wigner Function</strong><br>
Wim van Dam, Mark Howard<br>
Phys. Rev. A 83, 032310 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2497">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2497</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a quantum computer acting on d-dimensional systems, we analyze the computational power of circuits wherein stabilizer operations are perfect and we allow access to imperfect non-stabilizer states or operations. If the noise rate affecting the non-stabilizer resource is sufficiently high, then these states and operations can become simulable in the sense of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, reducing the overall power of the circuit to no better than classical. In this paper we find the depolarizing noise rate at which this happens, and consequently the most robust non-stabilizer states and non-Clifford gates. In doing so, we make use of the discrete Wigner function and derive facets of the so-called qudit Clifford polytope i.e. the inequalities defining the convex hull of all qudit Clifford gates. Our results for robust states are provably optimal. For robust gates we find a critical noise rate that, as dimension increases, rapidly approaches the the theoretical optimum of 100%. Some connections with the question of qudit magic state distillation are discussed.

<p><strong>13.    A quasipolynomial-time algorithm for the quantum separability problem</strong><br>
Fernando G.S.L. Brandao, Matthias Christandl, Jon Yard<br>
Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation (STOC&#39;11), June 2011, p. 343-351<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2751">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2751</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for solving the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable, i.e. non-entangled, bipartite density matrices. The algorithm decides whether a density matrix is separable or whether it is eps-away from the set of the separable states in time exp(O(eps^-2 log |A| log |B|)), where |A| and |B| are the local dimensions, and the distance is measured with either the Euclidean norm, or with the so-called LOCC norm. The latter is an operationally motivated norm giving the optimal probability of distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using any protocol formed by quantum local operations and classical communication (LOCC) between the parties. We also obtain improved algorithms for optimizing over the set of separable states and for computing the ground-state energy of mean-field Hamiltonians. The techniques we develop are also applied to quantum Merlin-Arthur games, where we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to LOCC protocols, or when the verification procedure is formed by a measurement of small Euclidean norm. This answers a question posed by Aaronson et al (Theory of Computing 5, 1, 2009) and provides two new characterizations of the complexity class QMA, a quantum analog of NP. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming to search for a symmetric extension, as first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialieri (Phys. Rev. A, 69, 022308, 2004). The bound on the runtime follows from an improved de Finetti-type bound quantifying the monogamy of quantum entanglement, proved in (arXiv:1010.1750). This result, in turn, follows from a new lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information and the entanglement measure squashed entanglement.

<p>
Quantum entanglement, one of the defining features of quantum mechanics, has been demonstrated in a variety of nonlinear spin-like systems. Quantum entanglement in linear systems has proven significantly more challenging, as the intrinsic energy level degeneracy associated with linearity makes quantum control more difficult. Here we demonstrate the quantum entanglement of photon states in two independent linear microwave resonators, creating N-photon NOON states as a benchmark demonstration. We use a superconducting quantum circuit that includes Josephson qubits to control and measure the two resonators, and we completely characterize the entangled states with bipartite Wigner tomography. These results demonstrate a significant advance in the quantum control of linear resonators in superconducting circuits.

<p><strong>15.    The Computational Complexity of Linear Optics</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Alex Arkhipov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the &quot;Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture&quot;, which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the &quot;Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture&quot;, which says that |Per(A)|&gt;=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.

Geometric phases and information flows of a two-level system coupled to its environment are calculated and analyzed.

We obtain an analytic relation between the geometric phase and the information flow for pure initial states, and a numerical result for mixed initial states. The geometric phase behaves differently depending on whether there are information flows back to the two-level system from its environment.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we develop a quantum transport theory to describe photonic transport in photonic networks. The photonic networks concerned in the paper consist of all-optical circuits incorporating photonic bandgap waveguides and driven resonators. The photonic transport flowing through waveguides are entirely determined from the exact master equation of the driven resonators. The master equation of the driven resonators is obtained by explicitly eliminating all the waveguide degrees of freedom while the back-reactions between resonators and waveguides are fully taken into account. The relations between the driven photonic dynamics and photocurrents are obtained. The non-Markovian memory structure and quantum coherence and decoherence effects in photonic transport are also fully included. This quantum transport theory unifies two fundamental nonequilibrium approaches, the Keldysh&#39;s nonequilibrium Green function technique and the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach, together to make the investigation of the transient quantum photonic transport become more powerful. As an illustration, the theory is applied to the transport phenomena of a driven nanocavity coupled to two waveguides in photonic crystals. The controllability of photonic transport through the driven resonator is demonstrated.

<p><strong>24.    Verifying Genuine High-Order Entanglement</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
High-order entanglement embedded in multipartite multilevel quantum systems (qudits) with many degrees of freedom (DOFs) plays an important role in quantum foundation and quantum engineering. Verifying high-order entanglement without the restriction of system complexity is a critical need in any experiments on general entanglement. Here, we introduce a scheme to efficiently detect genuine high-order entanglement, such as states close to genuine qudit Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, and cluster states as well as multilevel multi-DOF hyperentanglement. All of them can be identified with two local measurement settings per DOF regardless of the qudit or DOF number. The proposed verifications together with further utilities such as fidelity estimation could pave the way for experiments by reducing dramatically the measurement overhead.

<p><strong>25.    Non-Markovian Dynamics of Quantum and Classical Correlations in the Presence of System-Bath Coherence</strong><br>
Chuan-Feng Li, Hao-Tian Wang, Hong-Yuan Yuan, Rong-Chun Ge, Guang-Can Guo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5114">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5114</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed study of the dynamics of correlations in non-Markovian environments, applying the hierarchy equations approach. This theoretical treatment is able to take the system-bath interaction into consideration carefully. It is shown that crosses and sudden changes of classical and quantum correlations can happen if we gradually reduce the strength of the interactions between qubits. For some special initial states, sudden transitions between classical and quantum correlations even occur.

<p><strong>26.    Comparing different non-Markovianity measures: A case study</strong><br>
Pinja Haikka, James. D. Cresser, Sabrina Maniscalco<br>
Phys. Rev. A 83, 012112 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5328">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5328</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider two recently proposed measures of non-Markovianity applied to a particular quantum process describing the dynamics of a driven qubit in a structured reservoir. The motivation of this study is twofold: on one hand, we study the differences and analogies of the non-Markovianity measures and on the other hand, we investigate the effect of the driving force on the dissipative dynamics of the qubit. In particular we ask if the drive introduces new channels for energy and/or information transfer between the system and the environment, or amplifies existing ones. We show under which conditions the presence of the drive slows down the inevitable loss of quantum properties of the qubit.

<blockquote>
<p>
By offering effective modal volumes significantly less than a cubic wavelength, slot-waveguide cavities offer a new in-road into strong atom-photon coupling in the visible regime. Here we explore two-dimensional arrays of coupled slot cavities which underpin designs for novel quantum emulators and polaritonic quantum phase transition devices. Specifically, we investigate the lateral coupling characteristics of diamond-air and GaP-air slot waveguides using numerically-assisted coupled-mode theory, and the longitudinal coupling properties via distributed Bragg reflectors using mode-propagation simulations. We find that slot-waveguide cavities in the Fabry-Perot arrangement can be coupled and effectively treated with a tight-binding description, and are a suitable platform for realizing Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard physics.

<p><strong>28.    Maximal entanglement from quantum random walks</strong><br>
B. Alles, S. Gunduc, Y. Gunduc<br>
Quantum Information Processing: Volume 11, Issue 1 (2012), Page 211-227<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6023">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6023</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The conditions under which entanglement becomes maximal are sought in the general one--dimensional quantum random walk with two walkers. Moreover, a one--dimensional shift operator for the two walkers is introduced and its performance in generating entanglement is analyzed as a function of several free parameters, some of them coming from the shift operator itself and some others from the coin operator. To simplify the investigation an averaged entanglement is defined.

<p><strong>29.    A Markovian Model for Joint Observations, Bell&#39;s Inequality and Hidden States</strong><br>
Ulrich Faigle, Alexander Sch?nhuth<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1295">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1295</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
While the standard approach to quantum systems studies length preserving linear transformations of wave functions, the Markov picture focuses on trace preserving operators on the space of Hermitian (self-adjoint) matrices. The Markov approach extends the standard one and provides a refined analysis of measurements and quantum Markov chains. In particular, Bell&#39;s inequality becomes structurally clear. It turns out that hidden state models are natural in the Markov context. In particular, a violation of Bell&#39;s inequality is seen to be compatible with the existence of hidden states. The Markov model moreover clarifies the role of the &quot;negative probabilities&quot; in Feynman&#39;s analysis of the EPR paradox.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1973">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1973</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nanophotonic technologies offer great promise for ultra-low power optical signal processing, but relatively few nonlinear-optical phenomena have yet been explored as bases for robust digital modulation/switching~\cite{Yang07,Fara08,Liu10,Noza10}. Here we show that a single two-level system (TLS) coupled strongly to an optical resonator can impart binary phase modulation on a saturating probe beam. Our experiment relies on spontaneous emission to induce occasional transitions between positive and negative phase shifts---with each such edge corresponding to a dissipated energy of just one photon ($\approx 0.23$ aJ)---but an optical control beam could be used to trigger additional phase switching at signalling rates above this background. Although our ability to demonstrate controlled switching in our atom-based experiment is limited, we discuss prospects for exploiting analogous physics in a nanophotonic device incorporating a quantum dot as the TLS to realize deterministic binary phase modulation with control power in the aJ/edge regime.

In the present paper we study forward Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) defined on a Cayley tree. Using the tree structure of graphs, we give a construction of quantum Markov chains on a Cayley tree. By means of such constructions we prove the existence of a phase transition for the XY-model on a Cayley tree of order three in QMC scheme. By the phase transition we mean the existence of two now quasi equivalent QMC for the given family of interaction operators ${K_{<x,y>}}$.

<p>
The generation and control of quantum states of light constitute fundamental tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The superconducting realization of cavity QED, circuit QED, enables on-chip microwave photonics, where superconducting qubits control and measure individual photon states. A long-standing issue in cavity QED is the coherent transfer of photons between two or more resonators. Here, we use circuit QED to implement a three-resonator architecture on a single chip, where the resonators are interconnected by two superconducting phase qubits. We use this circuit to shuffle one- and two-photon Fock states between the three resonators, and demonstrate qubit-mediated vacuum Rabi swaps between two resonators. This illustrates the potential for using multi-resonator circuits as photon quantum registries and for creating multipartite entanglement between delocalized bosonic modes.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3871">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3871</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce two models of quasi-discrete optical systems: an array of waveguides doped by four-level N-type atoms, and a nonlinear checkerboard pattern, formed by doping with three-level atoms of the {\Lambda}-type. The dopant atoms are driven by external fields, to induce the effect of the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). These active systems offer advantages and addition degrees of freedom, in comparison with ordinary passive waveguiding systems. In the array of active waveguides, the driving field may adjust linear and nonlinear propagation regimes for a probe signal. The nonlinear checkerboard system supports the transmission of stable spatial solitons and their &quot;fuzzy&quot; counterparts, straight or oblique.

<p>
We report the observation of inverse-magnetic-field-periodic, radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures prepared in W. Wegscheider&#39;s group, compare their characteristics with similar oscillations in V. Umansky&#39;s material, and describe the lineshape variation vs. the radiation power, $P$, in the two systems. We find that the radiation-induced oscillatory $\Delta R_{xx}$, in both materials, can be described by $\Delta R_{xx} = -A exp(-\lambda/B)sin(2 \pi F/B)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\lambda$ is the damping parameter, and $F$ is the oscillation frequency. Both $\lambda$ and $F$ turn out to be insensitive to $P$. On the other hand, $A$ grows nonlinearly with $P$.

<p>
Recently invented and demonstrated, optical lattice clocks hold great promise for improving the precision of modern timekeeping. These clocks aim at the 10^-18 fractional accuracy, which translates into a clock that would neither lose or gain a fraction of a second over an estimated age of the Universe. In these clocks, millions of atoms are trapped and interrogated simultaneously, dramatically improving clock stability. Here we discuss the principles of operation of these clocks and, in particular, a novel concept of &quot;magic&quot; trapping of atoms in optical lattices. We also highlight recently proposed microwave lattice clocks and several applications that employ the optical lattice clocks as a platform for precision measurements and quantum information processing.

We study the transition matrix of a quantum walk on strongly regular graphs. It is proposed by Emms, Hancock, Severini and Wilson in 2006, that the spectrum of $S^+(U^3)$, a matrix based on the amplitudes of walks in the quantum walk, distinguishes strongly regular graphs. We find the eigenvalues of $S^+(U)$ and $S^+(U^2)$ for regular graphs.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5669">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5669</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide an essential link between light and matter in emerging fields such as light-harvesting, all-solid-state quantum communication, and quantum computing. QDs are excellent single-photon sources and can store quantum bits for extended periods making them promising interconnects between light and matter in integrated quantum information networks. To this end the light-matter interaction strength must be strongly enhanced using nanophotonic structures such as photonic crystal cavities and waveguides or plasmonic nanowires. So far it has been assumed that QDs can be treated just like atomic photon emitters where the spatial properties of the wavefunction can be safely ignored. Here we demonstrate that the point-emitter description for QDs near plasmonic nanostructures breaks down. We observe that the QDs can excite plasmons eight times more efficiently depending on their orientation due to their mesoscopic character. Either enhancement or suppresion of the rate of plasmon excitation is observed depending on the geometry of the plasmonic nanostructure in full agreement with a new theory. This discovery has no equivalence in atomic systems and paves the way for novel nanophotonic devices that exploit the extended size of QDs as a resource for increasing the light-matter interaction strength.

<p><strong>38.    Instability and Vortex Rings Dynamics in a Three-Dimensional Superfluid Flow Through a Constriction</strong><br>
F. Piazza, L. A. Collins, A. Smerzi<br>
New J. Phys. 13, 043008 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5041">http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5041</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the instability of a superfluid flow through a constriction in three spatial dimensions. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature in two different geometries: a straight waveguide and a torus. The constriction consists of a broad, repulsive penetrable barrier. In the hydrodynamic regime, we find that the flow becomes unstable as soon as the velocity at the classical (Thomas-Fermi) surface equals the sound speed inside the constriction. At this critical point, vortex rings enter inside the bulk region of the cloud. The nucleation and dynamics scenario is strongly affected by the presence of asymmetries in the velocity and density of the background condensate flow.
