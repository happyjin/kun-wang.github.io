    <p><strong>1.    Universal transversal gates with color codes - a simplified approach</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. A 91, 032330 (2015)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a simplified, yet rigorous presentation of the ideas from Bomb\&#39;{i}n&#39;s paper &quot;Gauge Color Codes&quot; [arXiv:1311.0879v3]. Our presentation is self-contained, and assumes only basic concepts from quantum error correction. We provide an explicit construction of a family of color codes in arbitrary dimensions and describe some of their crucial properties. Within this framework, we explicitly show how to transversally implement the generalized phase gate $R_n=\text{diag}(1,e^{2\pi i/2^n})$, which deviates from the method in &quot;Gauge Color Codes&quot;, allowing an arguably simpler proof. We describe how to implement the Hadamard gate $H$ fault-tolerantly using code switching. In three dimensions, this yields, together with the transversal $CNOT$, a fault-tolerant universal gate set ${H,CNOT,R_3}$ without state-distillation.

<p><strong>2.    Highly efficient entanglement swapping and teleportation at telecom wavelength</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement swapping at telecom wavelengths is at the heart of quantum networking in optical fiber infrastructures. Although entanglement swapping has been demonstrated experimentally so far using various types of entangled photon sources both in near-infrared and telecom wavelength regions, the rate of swapping operation has been too low to be applied to practical quantum protocols, due to limited efficiency of entangled photon sources and photon detectors. Here we demonstrate drastic improvement of the efficiency at telecom wavelength by using two ultra-bright entangled photon sources and four highly efficient superconducting nanowire single photon detectors.We have attained a four-fold coincidence count rate of 108 counts per second, which is three orders higher than the previous experiments at telecom wavelengths. A raw (net) visibility in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between the two independent entangled sources was 73.3 $\pm$ 1.0% (85.1 $\pm$ 0.8%). We performed the teleportation and entanglement swapping, and obtained a fidelity of 76.3% in the swapping test.Our results on the coincidence count rates are comparable with the ones ever recorded in teleportation/swaping and multi-photon entanglement generation experiments at around 800\,nm wavelengths. Our setup opens the way to practical implementation of device-independent quantum key distribution and its distance extension by the entanglement swapping as well as multi-photon entangled state generation in telecom band infrastructures with both space and fiber links.

<p><strong>3.    Photonic lattice simulation of dissipation-induced correlations in bosonic systems</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0294">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0294</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an optical simulation of dissipation-induced correlations in one-dimensional (1D) interacting bosonic systems, using a two-dimensional (2D) array of linear photonic waveguides and only classical light. We show that for the case of two bosons in a 1D lattice, one can simulate on-site two-body dissipative dynamics using a linear 2D waveguide array with lossy diagonal waveguides. The intensity distribution of the propagating light directly maps out the wave function, allowing one to observe the dissipation-induced correlations with simple measurements. Beyond the on-site model, we also show that a generalised model containing nearest-neighbour dissipative interaction can be engineered and probed in the proposed set-up.

<p><strong>4.    Invariance in quantum walks with time-dependent coin operators</strong><br>
Miquel Montero<br>
Phys. Rev. A 90, 062312 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0550">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0550</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we unveil some features of a discrete-time quantum walk on the line whose coin depends on the temporal variable. After considering the most general form of the unitary coin operator, we focus on the role played by the two phase factors that one can incorporate there, and show how both terms influence the evolution of the system. A closer analysis reveals that the probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker remain unaltered when the update rule of these phases is chosen adequately. This invariance is based on a symmetry with consequences not yet fully explored.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum conditional mutual information and approximate Markov chains</strong><br>
Omar Fawzi, Renato Renner<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0664">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0664</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A state on a tripartite quantum system $A \otimes B \otimes C$ forms a Markov chain if it can be reconstructed from its marginal on $A \otimes B$ by a quantum operation from $B$ to $B \otimes C$. We show that the quantum conditional mutual information $I(A: C | B)$ of an arbitrary state is an upper bound on its distance to the closest reconstructed state. It thus quantifies how well the Markov chain property is approximated.

<p><strong>6.    Non-Markovian dynamics of a single-mode cavity strongly coupled to an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. A 90, 043852 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0728">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0728</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a single-mode resonator driven by external pulses. When the mean frequency of the spin ensemble is in resonance with the cavity mode, damped Rabi oscillations are found between the spin ensemble and the cavity mode which we describe very accurately, including the dephasing effect of the inhomogeneous spin broadening. We demonstrate that a precise knowledge of this broadening is crucial both for a qualitative and a quantitative understanding of the temporal spin-cavity dynamics. On this basis we show that coherent oscillations between the spin ensemble and the cavity can be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude, when driving the system with pulses that match special resonance conditions. Our theoretical approach is tested successfully with an experiment based on an ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond strongly coupled to a superconducting coplanar single-mode waveguide resonator.

<p>
A matrix product state approach to non-Markovian, classical and quantum processes is discussed. In the classical case, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of all processes can be embedded into quantum measurement procedure. In the both cases, quantum and classical, the master equation can be derived from a projecting a quantum Markovian process onto a lower dimensional subspace.

<p><strong>8.    Enhancing Heralding Efficiency and Biphoton Rate in Type-I Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion</strong><br>
Hannah E. Guilbert, Daniel J. Gauthier<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0941">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0941</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is widely studied for applications in quantum information science due to its ability to produce two photons that can be entangled in many degrees of freedom. For applications in quantum communication, two metrics of this process are particularly important: heralding efficiency and total joint rate. Here, we derive expressions for both quantities for a variety of different beam geometries and frequencies. We pay specific attention to the spectrum of both biphotons and individual photons. We reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for the spectral shape and show they differ for different geometries and frequencies. We then use these spectra to calculate heralding efficiency and joint count rate and examine how each of these metrics changes with different geometries, frequencies, and spectral filtering and beam parameters. Interestingly, we find very high heralding efficiencies are achievable for collinear geometries, while noncollinear geometries require spectral filtering for high heralding efficiency, ultimately limiting the joint count rate. We also find that the the spectrum is narrower in nondegenerate cases, leading to lower joint count rates and higher heralding efficiency in the noncollinear case. In addition to the theory, we verify selected predictions with experimental results.

<p><strong>9.    Gaussian Entanglement Distribution via Satellite</strong><br>
Nedasadat Hosseinidehaj, Robert Malaney<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 022304 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1319">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1319</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we analyse three quantum communication schemes for the generation of Gaussian entanglement between two ground stations. Communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels dominated by turbulence-induced beam wander. In our first scheme the engineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers, with the satellite acting simply as a reflector. Although the channel state information of the two atmospheric channels remains unknown in this scheme, the Gaussian entanglement generation between the ground stations can still be determined. On the ground, distillation and Gaussification procedures can be applied, leading to a refined Gaussian entanglement generation rate between the ground stations. We compare the rates produced by this first scheme with two competing schemes in which quantum complexity is added to the satellite, thereby illustrating the trade-off between space-based engineering complexity and the rate of ground-station entanglement generation.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum attacks against iterated block ciphers</strong><br>
Marc Kaplan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1434">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1434</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the amplification of security against quantum attacks provided by iteration of block ciphers. In the classical case, the Meet-in-the-middle attack is a generic attack against those constructions. This attack reduces the time required to break double iterations to only twice the time it takes to attack a single block cipher, given that the attacker has access to a large amount of memory. More abstractly, it shows that security by composition does not achieve exact multiplicative amplification. We present a quantized version of this attack based on an optimal quantum algorithm for the Element Distinctness problem. We then use the generalized adversary method to prove the optimality of the attack. An interesting corollary is that the time-space tradeoff for quantum attacks is very different from what classical attacks allow. This first result seems to indicate that composition resists better to quantum attacks than to classical ones because it prevents the quadratic speedup achieved by quantizing an exhaustive search. We investigate security amplification by composition further by examining the case of four iterations. We quantize a recent technique called the dissection attack using the framework of quantum walks. Surprisingly, this leads to better gains over classical attacks than for double iterations, which seems to indicate that when the number of iterations grows, the resistance against quantum attacks decreases.

<p><strong>11.    Partial indistinguishability theory for multi-photon experiments in multiport devices</strong><br>
V. S. Shchesnovich<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1506">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1506</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We generalize an approach for description of multi-photon experiments with multi-port unitary linear optical devices, initiated in \textit{Phys. Rev. A \textbf{89}, 022333 (2014)} for the case of single photons in mixed spectral states, to arbitrary (multi-photon) input and arbitrary photon detectors. We give a physical interpretation of a non-negative definite Hermitian matrix, the matrix of a quadratic form giving output probabilities, as the partial indistinguishability matrix. We show that output probabilities are \textit{always} given in terms of the matrix permanents of the Hadamard product of network matrix and matrices depending on spectral state of photons and spectral sensitivities of detectors. Moreover, in case of input with up to one photon per mode, the output probabilities are given by a sum (or integral) with each term being the absolute value squared of such a matrix permanent. We conjecture that, for an arbitrary multi-photon input, zero output probability of an output configuration is \textit{always} the result of an exact cancellation of quantum transition amplitudes of completely indistinguishable photons (a subset of all input photons) and, moreover, \textit{does not depend} on coherence between only partially indistinguishable photons. The conjecture is supported by examples. Furthermore, we propose a measure of partial indistinguishability of photons which generalizes Mandel&#39;s observation, and find the law of degradation of quantum coherence in a realistic Boson-Sampling device with increase of the total number of photons and/or their &quot;classicality parameter&quot;.

<blockquote>
<p>
Propagation of a two-photon pulse in a waveguide coupled to a two-level system (TLS) is studied. The pulse is formed by two spatially separated identical wavepackets. A set of equations governing the dynamics of the photon distribution in the configuration-momentum space is derived and solved. It is shown that the distribution function can be negative that manifests its quasiprobability nature. A spectrum of the reflected light is found to be narrower than that of the transmitted light that features a pronounced filtering effect. Average numbers of the transmitted and reflected photons and their variances are shown to be dependent not only on the pulse widths and the light-TLS interaction but also on the pulse separation that can serve as an effective controlling parameter. Our approach is generalized for the case of an n-photon Fock state.

<p>
Building upon the demonstration of coherent control and single-shot readout of the electron and nuclear spins of individual 31-P atoms in silicon, we present here a systematic experimental estimate of quantum gate fidelities using randomized benchmarking of 1-qubit gates in the Clifford group. We apply this analysis to the electron and the ionized 31-P nucleus of a single P donor in isotopically purified 28-Si. We find average gate fidelities of 99.95 % for the electron, and 99.99 % for the nuclear spin. These values are above certain error correction thresholds, and demonstrate the potential of donor-based quantum computing in silicon. By studying the influence of the shape and power of the control pulses, we find evidence that the present limitation to the gate fidelity is mostly related to the external hardware, and not the intrinsic behaviour of the qubit.

<blockquote>
<p>
Exchange of information between a quantum system and its surrounding environment plays a fundamental role in the study of the dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we discuss the role of the information exchange in the non-Markovian behavior of dynamical quantum processes following the decoherence approach, where we consider a quantum system that is initially correlated with its measurement apparatus, which in turn interacts with the environment. We introduce a new way of looking at the information exchange between the system and environment using the quantum loss, which is shown to be closely related to the measure of non-Markovianity based on the quantum mutual information. We also extend the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 210402 (2014)] by Fanchini et al. in several directions, providing a more detailed investigation of the use of the accessible information for quantifying the backflow of information from the environment to the system. Moreover, we reveal a clear conceptual relation between the entanglement and mutual information based measures of non-Markovianity in terms of the quantum loss and accessible information. We compare different ways of studying the information flow in two theoretical examples. We also present experimental results on the investigation of the quantum loss and accessible information for a two-level system undergoing a zero temperature amplitude damping process. We use an optical approach that allows full access to the state of the environment.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum communication will improve the security of cryptographic systems and decision-making algorithms, support secure client-server computation, and improve the sensitivity of scientific instruments. As these applications consume quantum entanglement, a method for replenishing networked entanglement is essential. Direct transmission of quantum signals over long distances is prevented by fibre attenuation and the no-cloning theorem. This has motivated the development of quantum repeaters, which are designed to purify entanglement and extend its range. Quantum repeaters have been demonstrated over short distances, but an error-corrected repeater network with sufficient bandwidth over global distances will require new technology. In particular, no proposed hardware appears suitable for deployment along undersea cables, leaving the prospect of isolated metropolitan networks. Here we show that error-corrected quantum memories installed in cargo containers and carried by ship could provide a flexible and scalable connection between local networks, enabling low-latency, high-fidelity quantum communication across global distances. With recent demonstrations of quantum technology with sufficient fidelity to enable topological error correction, implementation of the necessary quantum memories is within reach, and effective bandwidth will increase with improvements in fabrication. Thus, our architecture provides a new approach to quantum networking that avoids many of the technological requirements of undersea quantum repeaters, providing an alternate path to a worldwide Quantum Internet.

<blockquote>
<p>
In spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) based quantum information processing (QIP) experiments, there is a tradeoff between the coincide count rates (i.e. the pumping power of the SPDC), which limits the rate of the protocol, and the visibility of the quantum interference, which limits the quality of the protocol. This tradeoff is mainly caused by the multi-photon pair emissions from the SPDCs. In theory, the problem is how to model the experiments without truncating these multi-photon emissions while including practical imperfections. In this paper, we establish a method to theoretically simulate SPDC based QIPs which fully incorporates the effect of multi-photon emissions and various practical imperfections. The key ingredient in our method is the application of the characteristic function formalism which has been used in continuous variable QIPs. We apply our method to three examples, the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen interference experiments, and the concatenated entanglement swapping protocol. For the first two examples, we show that our theoretical results quantitatively agree with the recent experimental results. Also we provide the closed expressions for these the interference visibilities with the full multi-photon components and various imperfections. For the last example, we provide the general theoretical form of the concatenated entanglement swapping protocol in our method and show the numerical results up to 5 concatenations. Our method requires only a small computation resource (few minutes by a commercially available computer) which was not possible by the previous theoretical approach. Our method will have applications in a wide range of SPDC based QIP protocols with high accuracy and a reasonable computation resource.

<blockquote>
<p>
In many applications entanglement must be distributed through noisy communication channels that unavoidably degrade it. Entanglement cannot be generated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), implying that once it has been distributed it is not possible to recreate it by LOCC. Recovery of entanglement by purely local control is however not forbidden in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics, and here we demonstrate in two all-optical experiments that such entanglement restoration can even be achieved on-demand. First, we implement an open-loop control scheme based on a purely local operation, without acquiring any information on the environment; then, we use a closed-loop scheme in which the environment is measured, the outcome controling the local operations on the system. The restored entanglement is a manifestation of &quot;hidden&quot; quantum correlations resumed by the local control. Relying on local control, both schemes improve the efficiency of entanglement sharing in distributed quantum networks.

<blockquote>
<p>
Single photons, manipulated using integrated linear optics, constitute a promising platform for universal quantum computation. A series of increasingly efficient proposals have shown linear-optical quantum computing to be formally scalable. However, existing schemes typically require extensive adaptive switching, which is experimentally challenging and noisy, thousands of photon sources per renormalized qubit, and/or large quantum memories for repeat-until-success strategies. Our work overcomes all these problems. We present a scheme to construct a cluster state universal for quantum computation, which uses no adaptive switching, no large memories, and which is at least an order of magnitude more resource-efficient than previous passive schemes. Unlike previous proposals, it is constructed entirely from loss-detecting gates and offers a robustness to photon loss. Even without the use of an active loss-tolerant encoding, our scheme naturally tolerates a total loss rate of $\sim 1.6\%$ in the photons detected in the gates. This scheme uses only 3-GHZ states as a resource, together with a passive linear-optical network. We fully describe and model the iterative process of cluster generation, including photon loss and gate failure. This demonstrates that building a linear optical quantum computer need be less challenging than previously thought.

Enhanced nonlinear optical response of a coherent atomic medium is the basis for many atomic sensors, and their performance is ultimately limited by the quantum fluctuations of the optical read-out. Here we demonstrate that off-resonant interactions can significantly modify the quantum noise of the optical field, even when their effect on the mean signal is negligible. We illustrate this concept by using an atomic magnetometer based on the nonlinear Faraday effect: the rotation of the light polarization is mainly determined by the resonant light-induced spin alignment, which alone does not change the photon statistics of the optical probe. Yet, we found that the minimum noise of output polarization rotation measurements is above the expected shot noise limit. This excess quantum noise is due to off-resonant coupling and grows with atomic density. We also show that the detection scheme can be modified to reduce the measured quantum noise (even below the shot-noise limit) but only at the expense of the reduced rotational sensitivity. These results show the existence of previously unnoticed factors in fundamental limitations in atomic magnetometry and could have impacts in many other atom-light based precision measurements.

Hypergraph states are multiqubit states whose combinatorial description and entanglement properties generalize the well-studied class of graph states. Graph states are important in applications such as measurement-based quantum computation and quantum error correction. The study of hypergraph states, with their richer multipartite entanglement and other nonlocal properties, has a promising outlook for new insight into multipartite entanglement. We present results analyzing local unitary symmetries of hypergraph states, including both continuous and discrete families of symmetries. In particular, we show how entanglement types can be detected and distinguished by certain configurations in the hypergraphs from which hypergraph states are constructed.

Some of the stable isotopes of silicon and carbon have zero nuclear spin, whereas many of the other elements that constitute semiconductors consist entirely of stable isotopes that have nuclear spins. Silicon and diamond crystals composed of nuclear-spin-free stable isotopes (Si-28, Si-30, or C-12) are considered to be ideal host matrixes to place spin quantum bits (qubits) for quntum computing and sensing applications because their coherent properties are not disrupted thanks to the absence of host nuclear spins. The present article describes the state-of-the-art and future perspective of silicon and diamond isotope engineering for development of quantum information processing devices.

<p>
Squashed entanglement [Christandl/Winter, JMP 45(3):829-840 (2004)] is a monogamous entanglement measure, which implies that highly extendible states have small value of the squashed entanglement. Here, invoking a recent inequality for the quantum conditional mutual information [Fawzi/Renner, arXiv:1410.0664], we show the converse, that a small value of squashed entanglement implies that the state is close to a highly extendible state. As a corollary, we establish an alternative proof of the faithfulness of squashed entanglement [Brandao/Christandl/Yard, CMP 306:805-830 (2011)]. We briefly discuss the pre-history of the Fawzi-Renner bound and related conjectures, and close by advertising a potentially far-reaching generalization to the monotonicity of the relative entropy.

We propose a scheme to characterize the non-Markovian dynamics and quantify the non-Markovianity via the non-classicality measured by the negativity of quantumness. By considering a qubit in contact with a critical Ising spin bath and introducing an ancilla, we show that revivals of negativity of quantumness indicate the non-Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, a normalized measure of non-Markovianity based on the negativity of quantumness is introduced and the influences of bath criticality, bath temperature and bath size on the non-Markovianity are discussed. It is shown that, at the critical point, the decay of non-Markovianity versus the size of spin bath is fastest and the non-Markovianity is exactly zero only in the thermodynamic limit. Besides, non-trivial behaviours of negativity of quantumness such as sudden change, double sudden changes and keeping constant are found for different relations between parameters of the initial state. Finally, how the non-classicality of the system is affected by a series of bang-bang pulses is also examined.

<p>
Hard-decision renormalization group (HDRG) decoders are an important class of decoding algorithms for topological quantum error correction. Due to their versatility, they have been used to decode systems with fractal logical operators, color codes, qudit topological codes, and non-Abelian systems. In this work, we develop a method of performing HDRG decoding which combines strenghts of existing decoders and further improves upon them. In particular, we increase the minimal number of errors necessary for a logical error in a system of linear size $L$ from $\Theta(L^{2/3})$ to $\Omega(L^{1-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We apply our algorithm to decoding $D(\mathbb{Z}_d)$ quantum double models and a non-Abelian anyon model with Fibonacci-like fusion rules, and show that it indeed significantly outperforms previous HDRG decoders. Furthermore, we provide the first study of continuous error correction with imperfect syndrome measurements for the $D(\mathbb{Z}_d)$ quantum double models. The parallelized runtime of our algorithm is $\text{poly}(\log L)$ for the perfect measurement case. In the continuous case with imperfect syndrome measurements, the averaged runtime is $O(1)$ for Abelian systems, while continuous error correction for non-Abelian anyons stays an open problem.

Discrete-time quantum walks can be regarded as quantum dynamical simulators since they can simulate spatially discretized Schr\&quot;{o}dinger, massive Dirac, and Klein-Gordon equations.

The first is the Fibonacci coin sequence with a generalized Hadamard coin and demonstrates six-step periodic dynamics.

We analytically show that these models have ballistic transportation properties and continuous limits identical to those of the massless Dirac equation with coin basis change.

<blockquote>
<p>
The propagation of $N$ photons in one dimensional waveguides coupled to $M$ qubits is discussed, both in the strong and ultrastrong qubit-waveguide coupling. Special emphasis is placed on the characterisation of the nonlinear response and its linear limit for the scattered photons as a function of $N$, $M$, qubit inter distance and light-matter coupling. The quantum evolution is numerically solved via the Matrix Product States technique. Both the time evolution for the field and qubits is computed. The nonlinear character (as a function of $N/M$) depends on the computed observable. While perfect reflection is obtained for $N/M \cong 1$, photon-photon correlations are still resolved for ratios $N/M= 2/20$. Inter-qubit distance enhances the nonlinear response. Moving to the ultrastrong coupling regime, we observe that inelastic processes are \emph{robust} against the number of qubits and that the qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the photons is qualitatively modified. The theory developed in this work modelises experiments in circuit QED, photonic crystals and dielectric waveguides.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this thesis we examine a variety of techniques for reducing the resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we show how to simplify universal encoded computation by using only transversal gates and standard error correction procedures, circumventing existing no-go theorems. We then show how to simplify ancilla preparation, reducing the cost of error correction by more than a factor of four. Using this optimized ancilla preparation, we develop improved techniques for proving rigorous lower bounds on the noise threshold. Additional overhead can be incurred because quantum algorithms must be translated into sequences of gates that are actually available in the quantum computer. In particular, arbitrary single-qubit rotations must be decomposed into a discrete set of fault-tolerant gates. We find that by using a special class of non-deterministic circuits, the cost of decomposition can be reduced by as much as a factor of four over state-of-the-art techniques, which typically use deterministic circuits. Finally, we examine global optimization of fault-tolerant quantum circuits under physical connectivity constraints. We adapt techniques from VLSI in order to minimize time and space usage for computations in the surface code, and we develop a software prototype to demonstrate the potential savings.

<p>
Error probability is a popular and well-studied optimization criterion in discriminating non-orthogonal quantum states. It captures the threat from an adversary who can only query the actual state once. However, when the adversary is able to use a brute-force strategy to query the state, discrimination measurement with minimum error probability does not necessarily minimize the number of queries to get the actual state. In light of this, we take Massey&#39;s guesswork as the underlying optimization criterion and study the problem of minimum guesswork discrimination. We show that this problem can be reduced to a semidefinite programming problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions when a measurement achieves minimum guesswork are presented. We also reveal the relation between minimum guesswork and minimum error probability. We show that the two criteria generally disagree with each other, except for the special case with two states. Both upper and lower information-theoretic bounds on minimum guesswork are given. For geometrically uniform quantum states, we provide sufficient conditions when a measurement achieves minimum guesswork. Moreover, we give the necessary and sufficient condition under which making no measurement at all would be the optimal strategy.

In this paper, we propose feedback designs for manipulating a quantum state to a target state by performing sequential measurements. In light of Belavkin&#39;s quantum feedback control theory, for a given set of (projective or non-projective) measurements and a given time horizon, we show that finding the measurement selection policy that maximizes the probability of successful state manipulation is an optimal control problem for a controlled Markovian process. The optimal policy is Markovian and can be solved by dynamical programming. Numerical examples indicate that making use of feedback information significantly improves the success probability compared to classical scheme without taking feedback. We also consider other objective functionals including maximizing the expected fidelity to the target state as well as minimizing the expected arrival time. The connections and differences among these objectives are also discussed.

<p>
A Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) inserted in a superconducting waveguide resonator imposes current and voltage boundary conditions that makes it suitable as a tuning element for the resonator modes. If such a SQUID element is subject to a periodically varying magnetic flux, the resonator modes acquire frequency side bands. In this work we calculate the multi-frequency eigenmodes of resonators coupled to periodically driven SQUIDs and we use the Lagrange formalism to propose a theory for their quantization. The elementary excitations of a multi-frequency mode can couple resonantly to physical systems with different transition frequencies and this makes the resonator an efficient quantum bus for state transfer and coherent quantum operations in hybrid quantum systems. As an example of the application of our multi-frequency modes, we determine their coupling to transmon qubits with different frequencies and we present a bi-chromatic scheme for entanglement and gate operations.

Relaxation imposes a fundamental limit on the sensitivity of state of the art quantum sensors which cannot be overcome by dynamical decoupling. The only way to overcome the relaxation rate is to utilise quantum error correcting codes, which are however challenging to integrate in the sensing scenario. We present a superconducting magnetometry design that incorporates approximate quantum error correction within its functioning, in which the signal is generated by a two qubit Hamiltonian term. This two qubit term is provided by the dynamics of a SQUID junction that couples two charge qubits. For fast enough error correction frequency, it is possible to lengthen the coherence time of the device beyond the relaxation limit.

Here we present an analysis of the required seed size, giving explicit upper bounds for the number of initial random bits needed to jump-start the protocol. The bits output from such a protocol are $\varepsilon$-close to uniform even against quantum adversaries. Our analysis yields that for a statistical distance of $\varepsilon=10^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$ from uniformity, the number of required bits is smaller than 225,000 and 715,000, respectively; in general it grows as $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$.

<p>
Measurements are a primitive for characterizing quantum systems. Reducing the time taken to perform a measurement may be beneficial in many areas of quantum information processing. We show that permuting the eigenvalues of the state matrix in the logical basis, using open loop control, provides a $O(n)$ reduction in the measurement time, where $n$ is the number of qubits in the register. This reduction is of the same order as the (previously introduced) locally optimal feedback protocol. The advantage of the open loop protocol is that it is far less difficult experimentally. Because the control commutes with the measured observable at all times, our rapid measurement protocol could be used for characterizing a quantum system, by state or process tomography, or to implement measurement-based quantum error correction.

<p>
Quantum codes excel at correcting local noise but fail to correct leakage faults that excite qubits to states outside the computational space. Aliferis and Terhal have shown that an accuracy threshold exists for leakage faults using gadgets called leakage reduction units (LRUs). However, these gadgets reduce the accuracy threshold and can increase overhead and experimental complexity, and these costs have not been thoroughly understood. Our work explores a variety of techniques for leakage-resilient, fault-tolerant error correction in the context of topological codes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we develop a leakage model that differs in critical details from earlier models. Second, we use Monte-Carlo simulations to survey several syndrome extraction circuits. Third, given the capability to perform three-outcome measurements, we present a dramatically improved syndrome processing algorithm. Our simulation results show that simple circuits with one extra CNOT per qubit and no additional ancillas reduce the accuracy threshold by less than a factor of 4 when leakage and depolarizing noise rates are comparable. This becomes a factor of 2 when the decoder uses 3-outcome measurements. Finally, when the physical error rate is less than 2 x 10^-4, placing LRUs after every gate may achieve the lowest logical error rates of all of the circuits we considered. We expect the closely related planar and rotated codes to exhibit the same accuracy thresholds and that the ideas may generalize naturally to other topological codes.

We investigate quantum annealing with antiferromagnetic fluctuations for the generalized Hopfield model with $k$-body interactions. The goal is to study the effectiveness of antiferromagnetic interactions, which were shown to help us avoid problematic first-order quantum phase transitions in pure ferromagnetic systems, in random systems. We estimate the efficiency of quantum annealing by analyzing phase diagrams for two cases where the number of embedded patterns is finite or extensively large. The phase diagrams of the model with finite patterns show that there exist annealing paths that avoid first-order transitions at least for $5 \le k \le 21$. The same is true for the extensive case with $k=4$. In contrast, it is impossible to avoid first-order transitions for the latter case with $k=2$, where the spin-glass phase hampers the quantum annealing process. These results indicate that quantum annealing with antiferromagnetic fluctuations can efficiently find the ground state of the generalized Hopfield model as long as the spin-glass phase does not exist.

An approach based on a non-Markovian time-convolutionless polaron master equation is used to probe the quantum dynamics of a chromophore-qubit in a super-Ohmic bath. Utilizing a measure of non-Markovianity based on dynamical fixed points, we study the effects of the environment temperature and the coupling strength on the non-Markovian behavior of the chromophore in a super-Ohmic bath. It is found that an increase in the temperature results in a reduction in the backflow information from the environment to the chromophore, and therefore, a suppression of non-Markovianity.

We study the mutual interaction between two identical quantum dots coupled to the normal modes of two-site photonic crystal molecules in a planar waveguide geometry, i.e. photonic crystal dimers. We find that the radiative coupling between the two quantum emitters is maximized when they are in resonance with either the bonding or the antibonding modes of the coupled cavity system. Moreover, we find that such effective interdot coupling is sizable, in the meV range, and almost independent from the cavities distance, as long as a normal mode splitting exceeding the radiative linewidth can be established (strong cavity-cavity coupling condition). In realistic and high quality factor photonic crystal cavity devices, such distance can largely exceed the emission wavelength, which is promising for long distance entanglement generation between two qubits in an integrated nanophotonic platform. We show that these results are robust against position disorder of the two quantum emitters within their respective cavities.

We propose a general relation between the walk dimensions $d_{w}$ of random walks and quantum walks, which illuminates fundamental aspects of the walk dynamics, such as its mean-square displacement. To this end, we extend the renormalization group analysis (RG) of the stochastic master equation to one with a unitary propagator. As in the classical case, the solution $\rho(x,t)$ in space and time of this quantum walk equation exhibits a scaling collapse for the variable $x^{d_{w}}/t$. In all cases studied, we find that $d_{w}$ of the discrete-time quantum walk with the Grover coin takes on exactly half the value found for the random walk on the same geometry, irrespective of whether it is a homogeneous lattice or a heterogeneous network. We demonstrate this circumstance for several networks with distinct properties using exact RG and confirm the collapse in each case with extensive numerical simulation.

The effect of the three-body term in the interaction potential is explored by comparing quantum dynamics results from a pairwise potential that neglects the three-body term to that derived from the full interaction potential. Inclusion of the three-body term in the close-coupling calculations was found to reduce the limiting rate coefficients by a factor of two. The reaction exoergicity populates vibrational levels as high as $v=19$ of the $^6$Li$</em>2$ molecule in the limit of zero collision energy. Product vibrational distributions from the close-coupling calculations reveal sensitivity to inclusion of three-body forces in the interaction potential. Overall, the results indicate that a simplified model based on the long-range potential is able to yield reliable values of the total reaction rate coefficient in the ultracold limit but a more rigorous approach based on statistical quantum or quantum close-coupling methods is desirable when product rovibrational distribution is required.

<p><strong>48.    Periodically-driven quantum matter: the case of resonant modulations</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum systems can show qualitatively new forms of behavior when they are driven by fast time-periodic modulations. In the limit of large driving frequency, the long-time dynamics of such systems can often be described by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian, which is generally identified through a perturbative treatment. Here, we present a general formalism that describes time-modulated physical systems, in which the driving frequency is large, but resonant with respect to energy spacings inherent to the system at rest. Such a situation is currently exploited in optical-lattice setups, where superlattice (or Wannier-Stark-ladder) potentials are resonantly modulated so as to control the tunneling matrix elements between lattice sites, offering a powerful method to generate artificial fluxes for cold-atom systems. The formalism developed in this work identifies the basic ingredients needed to generate interesting flux patterns and band structures using resonant modulations. Additionally, our approach allows for a simple description of the micro-motion underlying the dynamics; we illustrate its characteristics based on diverse dynamic-lattice configurations. It is shown that the impact of the micro-motion on physical observables strongly depends on the implemented scheme, suggesting that a theoretical description in terms of the effective Hamiltonian alone is generally not sufficient to capture the full time-evolution of the system.

<p><strong>49.    Integrated coherent matter wave circuits</strong><br>
C. Ryu, M. G. Boshier<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8814">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8814</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An integrated coherent matter wave circuit is a single device, analogous to an integrated optical circuit, in which coherent de Broglie waves are created and then propagate freely in waveguides where they can be switched, divided, recombined, and detected. Applications of such circuits include guided atom interferometers, atomtronic circuits, and precisely controlled delivery of atoms. Here we report experiments demonstrating integrated matter wave circuits for guided coherent matter waves. The circuit elements are created with the painted potential technique, a form of time-averaged optical dipole potential in which a rapidly-moving, tightly-focused laser beam exerts forces on atoms through their electrical polarizability. The source of coherent matter waves is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We launch BECs into painted waveguides that guide them around bends and form switches, phase coherent beamsplitters, and closed circuits. These developments open the door to creating arbitrary and dynamic coherent matter wave circuits.
