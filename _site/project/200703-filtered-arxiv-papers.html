    <p><strong>1.    Problems of the CASCADE Protocol and Renyi Entropy Reduction in Classical and Quantum Key Generation</strong><br>
Koichi Yamazaki, Ranjith Nair, Horace P. Yuen<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703012">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703012</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that the interactive error correction protocol `CASCADE&#39; should be analyzed taking the correlation between passes and finite length of sequence into account. Furthermore we mention some problems in quantifying the reduction of Renyi entropy by information announced during the error correction process.

<p><strong>2.    Every NAND formula of size N can be evaluated in time N^{1/2+o(1)} on a quantum computer</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Ben W. Reichardt, Robert Spalek, Shengyu Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703015">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703015</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
For every NAND formula of size N, there is a bounded-error N^{1/2+o(1)}-time quantum algorithm, based on a coined quantum walk, that evaluates this formula on a black-box input. Balanced, or ``approximately balanced,&#39;&#39; NAND formulas can be evaluated in O(sqrt{N}) queries, which is optimal. It follows that the (2-o(1))-th power of the quantum query complexity is a lower bound on the formula size, almost solving in the positive an open problem posed by Laplante, Lee and Szegedy.

<p><strong>3.    A Topos Foundation for Theories of Physics: I. Formal Languages for Physics</strong><br>
A. Doering, C.J. Isham<br>
J.Math.Phys.49:053515,2008<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703060">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703060</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when the topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different topos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the second is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that, as shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and expanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However, the main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and its representation in an appropriate topos.

<p><strong>4.    Bell-states diagonal entanglement witnesses for relativistic and non-relativistic multispinor systems in arbitrary dimensions</strong><br>
M. A. Jafarizadeh, R. Sufiani<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703106">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703106</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Two kinds of Bell-states diagonal (BSD) entanglement witnesses (EW) are constructed by using the algebra of Dirac $\gamma$ matrices in the space-time of arbitrary dimension $d$, where the first kind can detect some BSD relativistic and non-relativistic $m$-partite multispinor bound entangled states in Hilbert space of dimension $2^{m\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$, including the bipartite Bell-type and iso-concurrence type states in the four-dimensional space-time ($d=4$). By using the connection between Hilbert-Schmidt measure and the optimal EWs associated with states, it is shown that as far as the spin quantum correlations is concerned, the amount of entanglement is not a relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning. The introduced EWs are manipulated via the linear programming (LP) which can be solved exactly by using simplex method. The decomposability or non-decomposability of these EWs is investigated, where the region of non-decomposable EWs of the first kind is partially determined and it is shown that, all of the EWs of the second kind are decomposable. These EWs have the preference that in the bipartite systems, they can determine the region of separable states, i.e., bipartite non-detectable density matrices of the same type as the EWs of the first kind are necessarily separable. Also, multispinor EWs with non-polygon feasible regions are provided, where the problem is solved by approximate LP, and in contrary to the exactly manipulatable EWs, both the first and second kind of the optimal approximate EWs can detect some bound entangled states.

<p><strong>5.    Hyperentangled Bell-state analysis</strong><br>
Tzu-Chieh Wei, Julio T. Barreiro, Paul G. Kwiat<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 060305(R) (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703117">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703117</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that it is impossible to unambiguously distinguish the four Bell states encoded in pairs of photon polarizations using only linear optics. However, hyperentanglement, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom, has been shown to assist the complete Bell analysis of the four Bell states (given a fixed state of the other degrees of freedom). Yet introducing other degrees of freedom also enlarges the total number of Bell-like states. We investigate the limits for unambiguously distinguishing these Bell-like states. In particular, when the additional degree of freedom is qubit-like, we find that the optimal one-shot discrimination schemes are to group the 16 states into 7 distinguishable classes, and that an unambiguous discrimination is possible with two identical copies.

<p><strong>6.    Generation of Symmetric Dicke States of Remote Qubits with Linear Optics</strong><br>
C. Thiel, J. von Zanthier, T. Bastin, E. Solano, G. S. Agarwal<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 193602 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703137">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703137</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a method for generating all symmetric Dicke states, either in the long-lived internal levels of N massive particles or in the polarization degrees of freedom of photonic qubits, using linear optical tools only. By means of a suitable multiphoton detection technique, erasing Welcher-Weg information, our proposed scheme allows the generation and measurement of an important class of entangled multiqubit states.

<p><strong>7.    Kramers-Kronig relations for plasma-like permittivities and the Casimir force</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Kramers-Kronig relations are derived for the permittivity of the usual plasma model which neglects dissipation and of a generalized model which takes into account the interband transitions. The generalized plasma model is shown to be consistent with all precision experiments on the measurement of the Casimir force.

<p><strong>8.    Semidefinite programming characterization and spectral adversary method for quantum complexity with noncommuting unitary queries</strong><br>
Howard N. Barnum<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703141">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703141</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Generalizing earlier work characterizing the quantum query complexity of computing a function of an unknown classical <code>black box&#39;&#39; function drawn from some set of such black box functions, we investigate a more general quantum query model in which the goal is to compute functions of N by N</code>black box&#39;&#39; unitary matrices drawn from a set of such matrices, a problem with applications to determining properties of quantum physical systems. We characterize the existence of an algorithm for such a query problem, with given error and number of queries, as equivalent to the feasibility of a certain set of semidefinite programming constraints, or equivalently the infeasibility of a dual of these constraints, which we construct. Relaxing the primal constraints to correspond to mere pairwise near-orthogonality of the final states of a quantum computer, conditional on black-box inputs having distinct function values, rather than bounded-error determinability of the function value via a single measurement on the output states, we obtain a relaxed primal program the feasibility of whose dual still implies the nonexistence of a quantum algorithm. We use this to obtain a generalization, to our not-necessarily-commutative setting, of the ``spectral adversary method&#39;&#39; for quantum query lower bounds.

<blockquote>
<p>
We create independent, synchronized single-photon sources with built-in quantum memory based on two remote cold atomic ensembles. The synchronized single photons are used to demonstrate efficient generation of entanglement. The resulting entangled photon pairs violate a Bell&#39;s Inequality by 5 standard deviations. Our synchronized single photons with their long coherence time of 25 ns and the efficient creation of entanglement serve as an ideal building block for scalable linear optical quantum information processing.

<p><strong>10.    Linear Depth Stabilizer and Quantum Fourier Transformation Circuits with no Auxiliary Qubits in Finite Neighbor Quantum Architectures</strong><br>
D. Maslov<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 052310 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703211">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703211</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we investigate how quantum architectures affect the efficiency of the execution of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and linear transformations, which are essential parts of the stabilizer/Clifford group circuits. In particular, we show that in most common and realistic physical architectures including the linear nearest neighbor, two-dimensional lattice, and bounded degree graph (containing a chain of length n), n-qubit QFT and n-qubit stabilizer circuits can be parallelized to linear depth using no auxiliary qubits. We construct lower bounds that show the efficiency of our approach.

<p><strong>11.    Is orbital angular momentum always conserved in spontaneous parametric down-conversion?</strong><br>
Sheng Feng, Chao-Hsiang Chen, Geraldo A. Barbosa, Prem Kumar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703212">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703212</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the non-linear optical process of type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion, we present on an experiment showing that the two-photon detection amplitude of the down-converted beams does not generally reproduce the transverse profile of the pump beam that carries non-zero orbital angular momentum. We explain this observation by that orbital angular momentum is not conserved in the type-II non-linear process due to the broken rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.

<p><strong>12.    Cascade atom in high-Q cavity: The spectrum for non-Markovian decay</strong><br>
B.J.Dalton, B.M.Garraway<br>
J. Mod. Opt. 54, 2049 (2007).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703224">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703224</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The spontaneous emission spectrum for a three level cascade configuration atom in a single mode high-Q cavity coupled to a zero temperature reservoir of continuum external modes is determined from the atom-cavity mode master equation using the quantum regression theorem. Initially the atom is in its upper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the spectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated for the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end mirror (Case B-end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity (Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the same. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental effects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate and strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are resonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral features for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features of the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B and C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole at the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.

<p>
We study the problem of the practical realization of an abstract quantum circuit when executed on quantum hardware. By practical, we mean adapting the circuit to particulars of the physical environment which restricts/complicates the establishment of certain direct interactions between qubits. This is a quantum version of the classical circuit placement problem. We study the theoretical aspects of the problem and also present empirical results that match the best known solutions that have been developed by experimentalists. Finally, we discuss the efficiency of the approach and scalability of its implementation with regards to the future development of quantum hardware.

<p><strong>14.    Robust Quantum Error Correction via Convex Optimization</strong><br>
R.L. Kosut, A. Shabani, D.A. Lidar<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703274">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703274</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a semidefinite program optimization approach to quantum error correction that yields codes and recovery procedures that are robust against significant variations in the noise channel. Our approach allows us to optimize the encoding, recovery, or both, and is amenable to approximations that significantly improve computational cost while retaining fidelity. We illustrate our theory numerically for optimized 5-qubit codes, using the standard [5,1,3] code as a benchmark. Our optimized encoding and recovery yields fidelities that are uniformly higher by 1-2 orders of magnitude against random unitary weight-2 errors compared to the [5,1,3] code with standard recovery. We observe similar improvement for a 4-qubit decoherence-free subspace code.

<p><strong>15.    Incomplete pure dephasing of N-qubit entangled W states</strong><br>
Roland Doll, Martijn Wubs, Peter Hanggi, Sigmund Kohler<br>
Phys. Rev. B 76, 045317 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703075">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703075</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider qubits in a linear arrangement coupled to a bosonic field which acts as a quantum heat bath and causes decoherence. By taking the spatial separation of the qubits explicitly into account, the reduced qubit dynamics acquires an additional non-Markovian element. We investigate the time evolution of an entangled many-qubit W state, which for vanishing qubit separation remains robust under pure dephasing. For finite separation, by contrast, the dynamics is no longer decoherence-free. On the other hand, spatial noise correlations may prevent a complete dephasing. While a standard Bloch-Redfield master equation fails to describe this behavior even qualitatively, we propose instead a widely applicable causal master equation. Here we employ it to identify and characterize decoherence-poor subspaces. Consequences for quantum error correction are discussed.

We offer a theoretical design of new systems that show promise for digital biochemical computing, including realizations of error correction by utilizing redundancy, as well as signal rectification.

<p><strong>17.    The mathematical role of (commutative and noncommutative) infinitesimal random walks over (commutative and noncommutative) riemannian manifolds in Quantum Physics</strong><br>
Gavriel Segre<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0703011">http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0703011</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Anderson&#39;s nonstandard construction of brownian motion as an infinitesimal random walk on the euclidean line is generalized to an Hausdorff riemannian manifold. A nonstandard Feynman-Kac formula holding on such an Hausdorff riemannian manifold is derived. Indications are given on how these (radically elementary) results could allow to formulate a nonstandard version of Stochastic Mechanics (avoiding both the explicitly discussed bugs of Internal Set Theory as well as the controversial renormalization of the stochastic action). It is anyway remarked how this would contribute to hide the basic feature of Quantum Mechanics, i.e. the noncommutativity of the observables&#39; algebra, whose structure is naturally captured in the language of Noncommutative Probability and Noncommutative Geometry. With this respect some preliminary consideration concerning the notion of infinitesimal quantum random walk on a noncommutative riemannian manifold, the notion obtained by the Sinha-Goswami&#39;s definition of quantum brownian motion on a noncommutative riemannian manifold replacing a continuous time interval with an hyperfinite time interval, is presented.
