    <p><strong>1.    Adaptive Discrimination Scheme for Quantum Pulse Position Modulation Signals</strong><br>
Nicola Dalla Pozza, Nicola Laurenti<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0128">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0128</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the communication scenario, we consider the problem of the discrimination between the signals of the Quantum Pulse Position Modulation. We propose a receiver scheme that employs repeated local measurements in distinct temporal slots within the symbol time interval, adaptively chosen on the basis of the outcomes in the previous slots. By employing Dynamic Programming to optimize each measurement, we approach the theoretical performance limit much closer than existing receiver schemes.

<p><strong>2.    On complete positivity, Markovianity, and the quantum data-processing inequality, in the presence of initial system-environment correlations</strong><br>
Francesco Buscemi<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140502 (3 October 2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0363">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0363</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that complete positivity is not only sufficient but also necessary for the validity of the quantum data-processing inequality. As a consequence, the reduced dynamics of a quantum system are completely positive, even in the presence of initial correlations with its surrounding environment, if and only if such correlations do not allow any anomalous backward flow of information from the environment to the system. Our approach provides an intuitive information-theoretic framework to unify and extend a number of previous results.

<p><strong>3.    Minimum weight perfect matching of fault-tolerant topological quantum error correction in average $O(1)$ parallel time</strong><br>

QIC 15, 0145-0158 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1740">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1740</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a 2-D square array of qubits of extent $L\times L$. We provide a proof that the minimum weight perfect matching problem associated with running a particular class of topological quantum error correction codes on this array can be exactly solved with a 2-D square array of classical computing devices, each of which is nominally associated with a fixed number $N$ of qubits, in constant average time per round of error detection independent of $L$ provided physical error rates are below fixed nonzero values, and other physically reasonable assumptions. This proof is applicable to the fully fault-tolerant case only, not the case of perfect stabilizer measurements.

<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous quantum measurement is the backbone of various methods in quantum control, quantum metrology, and quantum information. Here, we present a generalized formulation of dispersive measurement of a complex quantum systems. We describe the complex system as an open quantum system that is strongly coupled to a non-Markovian environment, enabling the treatment of a broad variety of natural or engineered complex systems. The system is monitored via a probe resonator coupled to a broadband (Markovian) reservoir. Based on this model, we derive a formalism of Stochastic Hierarchy Equations of Motion (SHEM) describing the decoherence dynamics of the system conditioned on the measurement record. Furthermore, we demonstrate a spectroscopy method based on weak quantum measurement to reveal the non-Markovian nature of the environment, which we term weak spectroscopy.

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the proposals for the exploitation of two-dimensional quantum walks has been the efficient generation of entanglement. Unfortunately, the technological effort required for the experimental realization of standard two-dimensional quantum walks is significantly demanding. In this respect, an alternative scheme with less challenging conditions has been recently studied, particularly in terms of spatial-entanglement generation [C. Di Franco, M. Mc Gettrick, and Th. Busch, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 080502 (2011)]. Here, we extend the investigation to a scenario where a measurement is performed on the coin degree of freedom after the evolution, allowing a further comparison with the standard two-dimensional Grover walk.

<p><strong>6.    Localization and Recurrence of Quantum Walk in Periodic Potential on a Line</strong><br>
C.-I. Chou, C.-L. Ho<br>
Chin. Phys. B 23 (2014) 110302<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3186">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3186</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present numerical study of a model of quantum walk in periodic potential on the line. We take the simple view that different potentials affect differently the way the coin state of the walker is changed. For simplicity and definiteness, we assume the walker&#39;s coin state is unaffected at sites without potential, and is rotated in an unbiased way according to Hadamard matrix at sites with potential. This is the simplest and most natural model of a quantum walk in a periodic potential with two coins. Six generic cases of such quantum walks were studied numerically. It is found that of the six cases, four cases display significant localization effect, where the walker is confined in the neighborhood of the origin for sufficiently long times. Associated with such localization effect is the recurrence of the probability of the walker returning to the neighborhood of the origin.

<p>
The discrete time quantum walk defined as a quantum-mechanical analogue of the discrete time random walk have recently been attracted from various and interdisciplinary fields. In this review, the weak limit theorem, that is, the asymptotic behavior, of the one-dimensional discrete time quantum walk is analytically shown. From the limit distribution of the discrete time quantum walk, the discrete time quantum walk can be taken as the quantum dynamical simulator of some physical systems.

<p><strong>8.    The Dirac equation as a quantum walk: higher dimensions, observational convergence</strong><br>
Pablo Arrighi, Marcelo Forets, Vincent Nesme<br>
2014 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 47 465302<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3524">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3524</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Dirac equation can be modelled as a quantum walk, with the quantum walk being: discrete in time and space (i.e. a unitary evolution of the wave-function of a particle on a lattice); homogeneous (i.e. translation-invariant and time-independent), and causal (i.e. information propagates at a bounded speed, in a strict sense). This quantum walk model was proposed independently by Succi and Benzi, Bialynicki-Birula and Meyer: we rederive it in a simple way in all dimensions and for hyperbolic symmetric systems in general. We then prove that for any time t, the model converges to the continuous solution of the Dirac equation at time t, i.e. the probability of observing a discrepancy between the model and the solution is an O({\epsilon}^2), with {\epsilon} the discretization step. At the practical level, this result is of interest for the quantum simulation of relativistic particles. At the theoretical level, it reinforces the status of this quantum walk model as a simple, discrete toy model of relativistic particles.

<p><strong>9.    Propagation in quantum walks and relativistic diffusions</strong><br>

2012 Phys. Scr. 2012 014044<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3575">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3575</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Propagation in quantum walks is revisited by showing that very general 1D discrete-time quantum walks with time- and space-dependent coefficients can be described, at the continuous limit, by Dirac fermions coupled to electromagnetic fields. Short-time propagation is also established for relativistic diffusions by presenting new numerical simulations of the Relativistic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process. A geometrical generalization of Fick&#39;s law is also obtained for this process. The results suggest that relativistic diffusions may be realistic models of decohering or random quantum walks. Links with general relativity and geometrical flows are also mentioned.

<p><strong>10.    Generation and manipulation of entangled photons in a domain-engineered lithium niobate waveguide</strong><br>
Yang Ming, Ai-hong Tan, Zi-jian Wu, Zhao-xian Chen, Fei Xu, Yan-qing Lu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3834">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3834</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to integrate the electro-optic tuning function into polarization-entangled photon pair generation process in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). Due to the versatility of PPLN, both the spontaneously parametric down conversion and electro-optic polarization rotation effects could be realized simultaneously. Orthogonally-polarized and parallel-polarized photon pairs thus are instantly switchable by tuning the applied field. The characteristics of the source are investigated showing adjustable bandwidths and high entanglement degrees. Moreover, other kinds of reconfigurable entanglement are also achievable based on suitable domain-design. We believe the domain engineering is a very promising solution for next generation function-integrated quantum circuits.

<p><strong>11.    Hierarchy and dynamics of trace distance correlations</strong><br>

New J Phys 15, 093022 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3953">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3953</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We define and analyze measures of correlations for bipartite states based on trace distance. For Bell diagonal states of two qubits, in addition to the known expression for quantum correlations using this metric, we provide analytic expressions for the classical and total correlations. The ensuing hierarchy of correlations based on trace distance is compared to the ones based on relative entropy and Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Although some common features can be found, the trace distance measure is shown to differentiate from the others in that the closest uncorrelated state to a given bipartite quantum state is not given by the product of the marginals, and further, the total correlations are strictly smaller than the sum of the quantum and classical correlations. We compare the various correlation measures in two dynamical non-Markovian models, locally applied phase-flip channels and random external fields. It is shown that the freezing behavior, observed across all known valid measures of quantum correlations for Bell diagonal states under local phase-flip channels, occurs for a larger set of starting states for the trace distance than for the other metrics.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error-correction codes would protect an arbitrary state of a multi-qubit register against decoherence-induced errors, but their implementation is an outstanding challenge for the development of large-scale quantum computers. A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode in the presence of decoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished this goal using measurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the stabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively uses engineered dissipation to fight decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors, simplifying implementation. Instead the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block state for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems as demonstrated by a concurrent publication with trapped ion qubits, will be an essential tool for the implementation of quantum-error correction.

For the purpose of our presentation we will use Mathematica computer algebra system. This choice is motivated twofold. First, it offers a rich programming language based on the functional paradigm. Second, this programming language is combined with powerful symbolic and numeric manipulation capabilities.

<blockquote>
<p>
Computing ground states of local Hamiltonians is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. We give the first randomized polynomial-time algorithm for finding ground states of gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonians: it outputs an (inverse-polynomial) approximation, expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of polynomial bond dimension. The algorithm combines many ingredients, including recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems, convex programming, insights from classical algorithms for 1D satisfiability, and new techniques for manipulating and bounding the complexity of MPS. Our result provides one of the first major classes of Hamiltonians for which computing ground states is provably tractable despite the exponential nature of the objects involved.

<p>
We implement an entanglement distribution network based on wavelength-multiplexing and optical switching for quantum communication applications. Using a high-brightness source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in periodically-poled lithium niobate waveguides, we generate polarisation entangled photon pairs with a broad spectrum covering the telecom wavelengths around 1550nm. The photon pairs have entanglement fidelities up to 99%, and are distributed via passive wavelength multiplexing in a static multi-user network. We furthermore demonstrate a possible network application in a scenario with a single centralised source dynamically allocating two-party entanglement to any pair of users by means of optical switches. The whole system, from the pump laser up to the receivers, is fibre and waveguide based, resulting in maximal stability, minimal losses and the advantage of readily integrable telecom components in the 1550nm range.

<blockquote>
<p>
While adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) has some robustness to noise and decoherence it is widely believed that encoding, error suppression and error correction will be required to scale AQC to large problem sizes. Previous works have established at least two different techniques for error suppression in AQC. In this paper we derive a model for describing the dynamics of encoded AQC and show that previous constructions for error suppression can be unified with this dynamical model. In addition the model clarifies the mechanisms of error suppression and allow identification of its weaknesses. In the second half of the paper we utilize our description of non-equilibrium dynamics in encoded AQC to construct methods for error correction in AQC by cooling local degrees of freedom (qubits). While this is shown to be possible in principle, we also identify the key challenge to this approach: the requirement of high-weight Hamiltonians. Finally, we use our dynamical model to perform a simplified thermal stability analysis of concatenated-stabilizer-code encoded many-body systems for AQC or quantum memories. This work is a companion paper to &quot;\textit{Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and challenges}&quot; (Phys. Rev. X, 3, 041013 (2013)), which provides a quantum information perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and correction in AQC. In this paper we couch the same results within a dynamical framework, which allows for detailed analysis of the non-equilibrium dynamics of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC.

<blockquote>
<p>
Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is known to possess some intrinsic robustness, though it is likely that some form of error correction will be necessary for large scale computations. Error handling routines developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily to the AQC model since these routines typically require high-quality quantum gates, a resource not generally allowed in AQC. There are two main techniques known to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy gap protection and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that both these methods are intimately related and can be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form of error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing error correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems. This work is a companion paper to &quot;Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics&quot;&#39;, which provides a dynamical model perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and error correction in AQC. In this paper we discuss the same results within a quantum information framework, permitting an intuitive discussion of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC.

We show that a quantum walk process can be used to construct and secure quantum memory.

Since the localization occurss with a finite spread in position space, the stored information of the qubit will be naturally secured from the simple eavesdropper. Our protocol can be adopted to any quantum system for which experimental control over quantum walk dynamics can be achieved.

We examine the coherent propagation of the one-dimensional Frenkel exciton (correlated electron-hole pair system) based on a model of a quantum walker in multi-dimensional Hilbert space.

The dissipative coin flip operation is associated with amplitude leakages at occupied sites, typical of processes which occur when an exciton is transferred along dimer sites in photosynthetic protein complexes. We analyze the characteristics probability distribution of the one-dimensional quantum walk for various system parameters, and examine the complex interplay between non-Markovian signatures and amplitude leakages within the Hilbert position subspace. The visibility of topological defects such as exceptional points, and non-Markovian signatures via quantum tomography based spectroscopic measurements are discussed.

<p>
Integrated photonic technologies applied to quantum optics have recently enabled a wealth of breakthrough experiments in several quantum information areas. Path encoding was initially used to demonstrate operations on single or multiple qubits. However, a polarization encoding approach is often simpler and more effective. Two-qubits integrated logic gates as well as complex interferometric structures have been successfully demonstrated exploiting polarization encoding in femtosecond-laser-written photonic circuits. Still, integrated devices performing single-qubit rotations are missing. Here we demonstrate waveguide-based waveplates, fabricated by femtosecond laser pulses, capable to effectively produce arbitrary single-qubit operations in the polarization encoding. By exploiting these novel components we fabricate and test a compact device for the quantum state tomography of two polarization-entangled photons. The integrated optical waveplates complete the toolbox required for a full manipulation of polarization-encoded qubits on-chip, disclosing new scenarios for integrated quantum computation, sensing and simulation, and possibly finding application also in standard photonic devices.

<p><strong>25.    Non-Markovian Dynamical Maps: Numerical Processing of Open Quantum Trajectories</strong><br>
Javier Cerrillo, Jianshu Cao<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7743">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7743</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The initial stages of the evolution of an open quantum system encode the key information of its underlying dynamical correlations, which in turn can predict the trajectory at later stages. We propose a general approach based on non-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial trajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming time-translational invariance, the tensors can be used to accurately and efficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long timescales. The non-Markovian Transfer Tensor Method (TTM) demonstrates the coherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum dissipation and predicts the non-canonical equilibrium distribution due to the system-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation, and therefore can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the system Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in simulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be generalized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating the trajectories of an open quantum system.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present an integrated source of polarization entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime, which is based on type II-phasematched parametric down-conversion (PDC) in a Ti-indiffused waveguide in periodically poled lithium niobate. The domain grating -- consisting of an interlaced bi-periodic structure -- is engineered to provide simultaneous phase-matching of two PDC processes, and enables the direct generation of non-degenerate, polarization entangled photon pairs with a brightness of $B=7\times10^3$ pairs/(s mW GHz). The spatial separation of the photon pairs is accomplished by a fiber-optical multiplexer facilitating a high compactness of the overall source. Visibilities exceeding 95% and a violation of the Bell inequality with $S=2.57\pm0.06$ could be demonstrated.

<p><strong>27.    Error corrected quantum annealing with hundreds of qubits</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8190">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8190</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum information processing offers dramatic speedups, yet is famously susceptible to decoherence, the process whereby quantum superpositions decay into mutually exclusive classical alternatives, thus robbing quantum computers of their power. This has made the development of quantum error correction an essential and inescapable aspect of both theoretical and experimental quantum computing. So far little is known about protection against decoherence in the context of quantum annealing, a computational paradigm which aims to exploit ground state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than is possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing and provide an experimental demonstration using up to 344 superconducting flux qubits in processors which have recently been shown to physically implement programmable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over the performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These results pave a path toward large scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum optimization devices.

<p>
We demonstrate phase sensitivity in a horizontally guided, acceleration-sensitive atom interferometer with a momentum separation of 80hk between its arms. A fringe visibility of 7% is observed. Our coherent pulse sequence accelerates the cold cloud in an optical waveguide, an inherently scalable route to large momentum separation and high sensitivity. We maintain coherence at high momentum separation due to both the transverse confinement provided by the guide, and our use of optical delta-kick cooling on our cold-atom cloud. We also construct a horizontal interferometric gradiometer to measure the longitudinal curvature of our optical waveguide.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1181">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1181</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We extend effective field theory to the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking in genuinely finite quantum systems such as small superfluid systems, molecules or atomic nuclei, and focus on deformed nuclei. In finite superfluids, symmetry arguments alone relate the spectra of systems with different particle numbers. For systems with non-spherical intrinsic ground states such as atomic nuclei or molecules, symmetry arguments alone yield the universal features of the low-lying excitations as vibrations that are the heads of rotational bands. The low-lying excitations in deformed nuclei differ from those in molecules because of symmetry properties caused by pairing.

<p><strong>30.    Holographic entanglement entropy in nonlocal theories</strong><br>
Joanna L. Karczmarek, Charles Rabideau<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3517">http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3517</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compute holographic entanglement entropy in two strongly coupled nonlocal field theories: the dipole and the noncommutative deformations of SYM theory. We find that entanglement entropy in the dipole theory follows a volume law for regions smaller than the length scale of nonlocality and has a smooth cross-over to an area law for larger regions. In contrast, in the noncommutative theory the entanglement entropy follows a volume law for up to a critical length scale at which a phase transition to an area law occurs. The critical length scale increases as the UV cutoff is raised, which is indicative of UV/IR mixing and implies that entanglement entropy in the noncommutative theory follows a volume law for arbitrary large regions when the size of the region is fixed as the UV cutoff is removed to infinity. Comparison of behaviour between these two theories allows us to explain the origin of the volume law. Since our holographic duals are not asymptotically AdS, minimal area surfaces used to compute holographic entanglement entropy have novel behaviours near the boundary of the dual spacetime. We discuss implications of our results on the scrambling (thermalization) behaviour of these nonlocal field theories.

<blockquote>
<p>
Single photons are of paramount importance to future quantum technologies, including quantum communication and computation. Nonlinear photonic devices using parametric processes o?er a straightforward route to generating photons, however additional nonlinear processes may come into play and interfere with these sources. Here we analyse these sources in the presence of multi-photon processes for the ?first time. We conduct experiments in silicon and gallium indium phosphide photonic crystal waveguides which display inherently di?fferent nonlinear absorption processes, namely two-photon (TPA) and three-photon absorption (ThPA), respectively. We develop a novel model capturing these diverse eff?ects which is in excellent quantitative agreement with measurements of brightness, coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) and second-order correlation function g(2)(0), showing that TPA imposes an intrinsic limit on heralded single photon sources. We devise a new ?gure of merit, the quantum utility (QMU), enabling direct comparison and optimisation of single photon sources.

<p>
We report on four-wave mixing in coupled photonic crystal nano-cavities on a silicon-on-insulator platform. Three photonic wire cavities are side-coupled to obtain three modes equally separated in energy. The structure is designed to be self-filtering, and we show that the pump is rejected by almost two orders of magnitudes. We study both the stimulated and the spontaneous four-wave mixing processes: owing to the small modal volume, we find that signal and idler photons are generated with a hundred-fold increase in efficiency as compared to silicon micro-ring resonators.

<blockquote>
<p>
Fourier and fractional-Fourier transformations are widely used in theoretical physics. In this paper we make quantum perspectives and generalization for the fractional Fourier transformation (FrFT). By virtue of quantum mechanical representation transformation and the method of integration within normal ordered product (IWOP) of operators, we find the key point for composing FrFT, and reveal the structure of FrFT. Following this procedure, a full family of generalized fractional transformations are discovered with the usual FrFT as one special case. The eigen-functions of arbitrary GFrT are derived explicitly.

<blockquote>
<p>
We have measured the normalized gradient of the Casimir force between Au-coated surfaces of the sphere and the plate and equivalent Casimir pressure between two parallel Au plates at T=77K. These measurements have been performed by means of dynamic force microscope adapted for operating at low temperatures in the frequency shift technique. It was shown that the measurement results at T=77K are in a very good agreement with those at T=300K and with computations at T=77K using both theoretical approaches to the thermal Casimir force proposed in the literature. No thermal effect in the Casimir pressure was observed in the limit of experimental errors with the increase of temperature from T=77K to T=300K. Taking this into account, we have discussed the possible role of patch potentials in the comparison between measured and calculated Casimir pressures.

<blockquote>
<p>
Strongly coupled organic systems are characterized by unusually large Rabi splittings, even in the vacuum state. They show the counter-intuitive feature of a lifetime of the lower polariton state longer than for all other excited states. Here we build up a new theoretical framework to understand the dynamics of such coupled system. In particular, we show that the non-Markovian character of the relaxation of the dressed organic system explains the long lifetime of the lower polariton state.
