    <p><strong>1.    Detector dependency of diffusive quantum monitorings</strong><br>

<p>
Continuous measurements play a pivotal role in the study of dynamical open quantum systems. `Dyne&#39; detections are among the most widespread and efficient measurement schemes, and give rise to quantum diffusion of the conditioned state. In this work we study under what conditions the detector dependency of the conditional state of a quantum system subject to diffusive monitoring can be demonstrated experimentally, in the sense of ruling our any detector-independent pure-state dynamical model for the system. We consider an arbitrary number L of environments to which the system is coupled, and an arbitrary number K of different types of dyne detections. We prove that non-trivial necessary conditions for such a demonstration can be determined efficiently by semi-definite programming. To determine sufficient conditions, different physical environmental couplings and Hamiltonians for a qubit, and different sets of diffusive monitorings are scrutinized. We compare the threshold efficiencies that are sufficient in the various cases, as well as cases previously considered in the literature, to suggest the most feasible experimental options.

<p>
We provide analytical expressions for classical and total trace-norm (Schatten 1-norm) geometric correlations in the case of two-qubit X states. As an application, we consider the open-system dynamical behavior of such correlations under phase and generalized amplitude damping evolutions. Then, we show that geometric classical correlations can characterize the emergence of the pointer basis of an apparatus subject to decoherence in either Markovian or non-Markovian regimes. In particular, as a non-Markovian effect, we obtain a time delay for the information to be retrieved from the apparatus by a classical observer. Moreover, we show that the set of initial X states exhibiting sudden transitions in the geometric classical correlation has nonzero measure.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the recent years we have seen that Grover search algorithm [1] by using quantum parallelism has revolutionized the field of solving huge class of NP problems in comparison to classical systems. In this work we explore the idea of extending the Grover search algorithm to approximate algorithms. Here we try to analyze the applicability of Grover search to process an unstructured database with dynamic selection function as compared to the static selection function in the original work[1]. This allows us to extend the application of Grover search to the field of randomized search algorithms. We further use the Dynamic Grover search algorithm to define the goals for a recommendation system, and define the algorithm for recommendation system for binomial similarity distribution space giving us a quadratic speedup over traditional unstructured recommendation systems. Finally we see how the Dynamic Grover Search can be used to attack a wide range of optimization problems where we improve complexity over existing optimization algorithms.

<p>
Linear optics underpins tests of fundamental quantum mechanics and computer science, as well as quantum technologies. Here we experimentally demonstrate the longstanding goal of a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons and their measurement with a 12 single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with average fidelity 0.999 $\pm$ 0.001. Our system is capable of switching between these and any other linear optical protocol in seconds. These results point the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.

<blockquote>
<p>
Experimental observations of quantum walks in one dimension have provided many exciting applications in quantum computing, while recent theoretical investigation of single phase defect in these system points towards interesting phenomena associated with bounds states. Here we obtain analytical solutions of quantum walk with a general quantum coin in one dimension with multiple defects, with new prediction on the condition for zero reflectance for scattering state, and the existence of an analogy to the Ramsauer effect for multiple defects. We also show the transition from the zero reflectance state to the bound state can provide a method for preparing the quantum walk in a bound state. Applications to systems similar to thin film optics are suggested.

<p><strong>6.    Non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems, such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum transport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a classical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a noisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here, recent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition, to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the quantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series of examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new perspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is interacting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal correlations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their local detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.

<p><strong>7.    Parafermions in a Kagome lattice of qubits for topological quantum computation</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Engineering complex non-Abelian anyon models with simple physical systems is crucial for topological quantum computation. Unfortunately, the simplest systems are typically restricted to Majorana zero modes (Ising anyons). Here we go beyond this barrier, showing that the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermion model of non-Abelian anyons can be realized on a qubit lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions. Our system additionally contains the Abelian $D(\mathbb{Z}_4)$ anyons as low-energetic excitations. We show that braiding of these parafermions with each other and with the $D(\mathbb{Z}_4)$ anyons allows the entire $d=4$ Clifford group to be generated. The error correction problem for our model is also studied in detail, guaranteeing fault-tolerance of the topological operations. Crucially, since the non-Abelian anyons are engineered through defect lines rather than as excitations, non-Abelian error correction is not required. Instead the error correction problem is performed on the underlying Abelian model, allowing high noise thresholds to be realized.

<blockquote>
<p>
Novel quantum technology becomes mature when it can successfully be implemented in compact, integrated and easy-to-use devices. In response to this challenge, the quantum information community has recently achieved impressive results by reproducing linear bulk setups in a waveguide-based platform [1-10]. Even so, the generation of tailored quantum states in integrated sources suffers from severe limitations. While waveguide systems overcome the brightness and stability issues of bulk crystals, the confinement restricts the possibilities of source engineering. In particular, the generation of light in spatially separated modes, as needed for the preparation of specific bi-partite systems like N00N states [11], is prohibited in waveguides [12,13]. Recently, two experiments have gained control over this fundamental limitation by combining different waveguide sources followed by linear optical elements [14,15]. Yet, this approach requires the use of extra resources like active phase stabilisation, filtering or post-selection. Here, we harness the path degree of freedom in waveguide sources without additional overhead. As an example we implement an ultra-bright tunable two-channel integrated device which generates post-processing free, indistinguishable two-photon N00N states. We take advantage of the integration of parametric down-conversion in a single directional coupler and show that a clever engineering of the non-linear structure gets rid of the need for phase stabilisation, narrow-band filtering and spatial post-selection. This type of effective integration goes beyond reproducing a bulk setup on a chip and combines the action of many optical elements in one. Based on this concept, our device greatly simplifies the generation of intricate multi-channel quantum states and reduces the required complexity of linear networks for quantum information applications.

<p><strong>9.    An Effective Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Random Walk</strong><br>
Debajyoti Sarkar, Niladri Paul, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Tarun Kanti Ghosh<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.01435">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.01435</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we present an effective Hamiltonian approach for Discrete Time Quantum Random Walk. A form of the Hamiltonian for one dimensional quantum walk has been prescribed, utilizing the fact that Hamiltonians are the generators of time translations. Then an attempt has been made to generalize the techniques to higher dimensions. We find that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a Weyl Hamiltonian and a Dirac comb potential. The time evolution operator obtained from this prescribed Hamiltonian is in complete agreement with that of the standard approach. But in higher dimension we find that the time evolution operator is additive, instead of being multiplicative \cite{Chandrasekhar:2013SREP08229}. We showed that in case of two-step walk, effectively the time evolution operator can have multiplicative form. In case of a square lattice, quantum walk has been studied computationally for different coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative approaches have been compared. Using the Graphene Hamiltonian the walk has been studied on a Graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive approach over the multiplicative one.

<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement between two qubits (two level atoms) mediated by surface plasmons in three-dimensional plasmonic waveguides is studied using a quantum master equation formalism. Two types of waveguides, a nanowire and a V-shaped channel cut in a flat metal plane, are considered. The Green functions for the waveguides, which rigorously describes the dissipative qubit environment, are calculated numerically using a direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell&#39;s equations. Finite-length effects are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing entanglement, and resonant-length plasmonic waveguides can provide higher entanglement between qubits than infinite-length waveguides. It is also shown that coupling slots can improve entanglement via stronger qubit-waveguide coupling, for both the infinite- and finite-waveguide cases.

<blockquote>
<p>
A randomly walking quantum particle searches in Grover&#39;s $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ iterations for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices by repeatedly querying an oracle that flips the amplitude at the marked vertex, scattering by a &quot;coin&quot; flip, and hopping. Physically, however, potential energy barriers can hinder the hop and cause the search to fail, even when the amplitude of not hopping decreases with $N$. We correct for these errors by interpreting the quantum walk search as an amplitude amplification algorithm and modifying the phases applied by the coin flip and oracle such that the amplification recovers the $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ runtime.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nuclear spin registers in the vicinity of electron spins in solid state systems offer a powerful resource to address the challenge of scalability in quantum architectures. We investigate here the properties of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins surrounding donor atoms in silicon, and consider the use of such spins, combined with the donor nuclear spin, as a quantum register coupled to the donor electron spin. We find the coherence of the nearby $^{29}$Si nuclear spins is effectively protected by the presence of the donor electron spin, leading to coherence times in the second timescale - over two orders of magnitude greater than the coherence times in bulk silicon. We theoretically investigate the use of such a register for quantum error correction, including methods to protect nuclear spins from the ionisation/neutralisation of the donor, which is necessary for the re-initialisation of the ancillae qubits. This provides a route for multi-round quantum error correction using donors in silicon.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.02278">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.02278</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent tests performed on the D-Wave Two quantum annealer have revealed no clear evidence of speedup over conventional silicon-based technologies. Here, we present results from classical parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with isoenergetic cluster moves of the archetypal benchmark problem-an Ising spin glass-on the native chip topology. Using realistic uncorrelated noise models for the D-Wave Two quantum annealer, we study the best-case resilience, i.e., the probability that the ground-state configuration is not affected by random fields and random-bond fluctuations found on the chip. We thus compute classical upper-bound success probabilities for different types of disorder used in the benchmarks and predict that an increase in the number of qubits will require either error correction schemes or a drastic reduction of the intrinsic noise found in these devices. We outline strategies to develop robust, as well as hard benchmarks for quantum annealing devices, as well as any other computing paradigm affected by noise.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.02622">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.02622</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, a protocol for quantum state discrimination (QSD) in a multi-party scenario has been introduced [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 100501 (2013)]. In this protocol, Alice generates a quantum system in one of two pre-defined non-orthogonal qubit states, and the goal is to send the generated state information to different parties without any classical communication between them. The interesting feature is that, by resorting to sequential generalized measurements onto this system, there is a non-vanishing probability that all observers identify the state prepared by Alice. Here, we present the experimental implementation of this protocol based on polarization single-photon states. Our scheme works over a linear optical network, and since QSD lies in the core of many protocols, it represents a step towards experimental multi-party quantum information processing.

<p><strong>15.    High Dimensional Unitary Transformations and Boson Sampling on Temporal Modes using Dispersive Optics</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.03103">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.03103</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present methods which allow orders of magnitude increase in the number of modes in linear optics experiments by moving from spatial encoding to temporal encoding and using dispersion. This enables significant practical advantages for linear quantum optics and Boson Sampling experiments. Passing consecutively heralded photons through time-independent dispersion and measuring the output time of the photons is equivalent to a Boson Sampling experiment for which no efficient classical algorithm is reported, to our knowledge. With time-dependent dispersion, it is possible to implement arbitrary single-particle unitaries. Given the relatively simple requirements of these schemes, they provide a path to realizing much larger linear quantum optics experiments including post-classical Boson Sampling machines.

We consider the feasibility of exploiting the higher dimensionality of the Hilbert space of the chain elements for the transmission of a larger amount of information, and the effects of unwanted excitations during the process. Finally, we exploit the information-flux method to provide bounds to the transfer fidelity.

We construct measures for the non-Markovianity of quantum evolution with a physically meaningful interpretation.

We relate the proposed measures to the task of information screening. This shows that the non-Markovianity of a quantum process may be used as a resource. Under these considerations, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, a qubit in a quantum environment with classically mixed dynamics and the Jaynes-Cummings model.

<blockquote>

We propose a quantum repeater for continuous variable (CV) quantum optical states. Our repeater relies on an error correction protocol for loss on CV states based on CV teleportation and entanglement distillation via noiseless linear amplification. The error correction protocol is concatenated to preserve the same effective transmission coefficient for the quantum channel over increasing distance. The probability of successful operation of the repeater scales polynomially with distance. However, the protocol is limited by a trade-off between fidelity and probability of success.

<p>
Boson Sampling is a computational task strongly believed to be hard for classical computers, but efficiently solvable by orchestrated bosonic interference in a specialised quantum computer. Current experimental schemes, however, are still insufficient for a convincing demonstration of the advantage of quantum over classical computation. A new variation of this task, Scattershot Boson Sampling, leads to an exponential increase in speed of the quantum device, using a larger number of photon sources based on parametric downconversion. This is achieved by having multiple heralded single photons being sent, shot by shot, into different random input ports of the interferometer. Here we report the first Scattershot Boson Sampling experiments, where six different photon-pair sources are coupled to integrated photonic circuits. We employ recently proposed statistical tools to analyse our experimental data, providing strong evidence that our photonic quantum simulator works as expected. This approach represents an important leap toward a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.

<p>
The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is widely regarded as the quintessential quantum interference phenomenon in optics. In this work we examine how nonlinearity can smear statistical photon bunching in the HOM interferometer. We model both the nonlinearity and a balanced beam splitter with a single two-level system and calculate a finite probability of anti-bunching arising in this geometry. We thus argue that the presence of such nonlinearity would reduce the visibility in the standard HOM setup, offering some explanation for the diminution of the HOM visibility observed in many experiments. We use the same model to show that the nonlinearity affects a resonant two-photon propagation through a two-level impurity in a waveguide due to a &quot;weak photon blockade&quot; caused by the impossibility of double-occupancy and argue that this effect might be stronger for multi-photon propagation.

A global solution of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation for explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians is derived by integrating the non-linear differential equation associated with the time-dependent wave operator. A fast iterative solution method is proposed in which, however, numerous integrals over time have to be evaluated. This internal work is done using a numerical integrator based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The case of a transition between two potential wells of a model molecule driven by intense laser pulses is used as an illustrative example. This application reveals some interesting features of the integration technique. Each iteration provides a global approximate solution on grid points regularly distributed over the full time propagation interval. Inside the convergence radius, the complete integration is competitive with standard algorithms, especially when high accuracy is required.

<blockquote>
<p>
Pearle (1970) gave an example of a local hidden variables model which exactly reproduced the singlet correlations of quantum theory, through the device of data-rejection: particles can fail to be detected in a way which depends on the hidden variables carried by the particles and on the measurement settings. If the experimenter computes correlations between measurement outcomes of particle pairs for which both particles are detected, he is actually looking at a subsample of particle pairs, determined by interaction involving both measurement settings and the hidden variables carried in the particles. We correct a mistake in Pearle&#39;s formulas (a normalization error) and more importantly show that the model is more simple than first appears. We illustrate with visualisations of the model and with a small simulation experiment, with code in the statistical programming language R included in the paper. Open problems are discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
There are at least three models of discrete-time quantum walks (QWs) on graphs currently under active development. In this work we focus on the equivalence of two of them, known as Szegedy&#39;s and staggered QWs. We give a formal definition of the staggered model and discuss generalized versions for searching marked vertices. Using this formal definition, we prove that any instance of Szegedy&#39;s model is equivalent to an instance of the staggered model. On the other hand, we show that there are instances of the staggered model that cannot be cast into Szegedy&#39;s framework. Our analysis also works when there are marked vertices. We show that Szegedy&#39;s spatial search algorithms can be converted into search algorithms in staggered QWs. We take advantage of the similarity of those models to define the quantum hitting time in the staggered model and to describe a method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator of staggered QWs.

<p>
A simple calculation method for photon statistics of frequency-filtered fields is proposed. This method, based on eigenvalue decompositions of superoperators, allows us to study effects on the photon statistics of spectral filtering by various types of filters, such as Gaussian and rectangular filters as well as Lorentzian filters, which is not possible by conventional approaches. As an example, this method is applied to a simulation of quantum dot single-photon emitters, where we found the efficient choice of the filter types to have pure single photons depends on the excitation conditions i.e. incoherent or coherent (and resonant) excitations.

<blockquote>
<p>
The concept of non-Markovianity (NM) in quantum dynamics is still an open debate. Understanding how to generate and measure NM in specific models may aid in this quest. In quantum optics, an engineered electromagnetic environment coupled to a single atom can induce NM. The most common scenario of structured electromagnetic environment is an optical cavity, composed by a pair of mirrors. Here, we show how to generate and measure NM on a two-level system coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide with no mirrors required. The origin of the non-Markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field, prepared as a single-photon packet. We analyze how NM depends on two experimentally controllable parameters, namely, the linewidth of the packet and its central frequency. We relate the presence of NM to a $\pi$-phase shift between incoming and emitted fields. We also show how the two output channels of the waveguide provide distinct signatures of NM, both experimentally accessible.

We investigate non-Markovianity measure using two-time correlation functions for open quantum systems. We define non-Markovianity measure as the difference between the exact two-time correlation function and the one obtained in the Markov limit. Such non-Markovianity measure can easily be measured in experiments. We found that the non-Markovianity dynamics in different time scale crucially depends on the system-environment coupling strength and other physical parameters such as the initial temperature of the environment and the initial state of the system. In particular, we obtain the short-time and long-time behaviors of non-Markovianity for different spectral densities. We also find that the thermal fluctuation always reduce the non-Markovian memory effect. Also, the non-Markovianity measure shows non-trivial initial state dependence in different time scales.

We introduce a method of characterization of non-Markovianity using coherence of a system interacting with the environment.

We also define a measure to quantify non-Markovianity of the underlying dynamics based on the non-monotonic behavior of the coherence measure. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity marker in the behavior of dephasing and dissipative dynamics for one and two qubit cases. We also show that our proposed measure captures the back-flow of information from the environment to the system and compatible with well known distinguishability criteria of non-Markovianity.

<p>
We provide a detailed estimate for the logical resource requirements of the quantum linear system algorithm (QLSA) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] including the recently described generalization [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 250504 (2013)]. Our resource estimates are based on the standard quantum-circuit model of quantum computation; they comprise circuit width, circuit depth, the number of qubits and ancilla qubits employed, and the overall number of elementary quantum gate operations as well as more specific gate counts for each elementary fault-tolerant gate from the standard set {X, Y, Z, H, S, T, CNOT}. To perform these estimates, we used an approach that combines manual analysis with automated estimates generated via the Quipper quantum programming language and compiler. Our estimates pertain to the example problem size N=332,020,680 beyond which, according to a crude big-O complexity comparison, QLSA is expected to run faster than the best known classical linear-system solving algorithm. For this problem size, a desired calculation accuracy 0.01 requires an approximate circuit width 340 and circuit depth of order $10^{25}$ if oracle costs are excluded, and a circuit width and depth of order $10^8$ and $10^{29}$, respectively, if oracle costs are included, indicating that the commonly ignored oracle resources are considerable. In addition to providing detailed logical resource estimates, it is also the purpose of this paper to demonstrate explicitly how these impressively large numbers arise with an actual circuit implementation of a quantum algorithm. While our estimates may prove to be conservative as more efficient advanced quantum-computation techniques are developed, they nevertheless provide a valid baseline for research targeting a reduction of the resource requirements, implying that a reduction by many orders of magnitude is necessary for the algorithm to become practical.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of a single photon pulse travels through a linear atomic chain coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) single mode photonic waveguide. We derive a time-dependent dynamical theory for this collective many-body system which allows us to study the real time evolution of the photon transport and the atomic excitations. Our analytical result is consistent with previous numerical calculations when there is only one atom. For an atomic chain, the collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide mode can significantly change the dynamics of the system. The reflectivity of a photon can be tuned by changing the ratio of coupling strength and the photon linewidth or by changing the number of atoms in the chain. The reflectivity of a single photon pulse with finite bandwidth can even approach $100\%$. The spectrum of the reflected and transmitted photon can also be significantly different from the single atom case. Many interesting physical phenomena can occur in this system such as the photonic bandgap effects, quantum entanglement generation, Fano-like interference, and superradiant effects. For engineering, this system may serve as a single photon frequency filter, single photon modulation and may find important applications in quantum information.

<p>
A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g. the Dirac equation), and thus provide us with discrete toy models of familiar particles (e.g. the electron). In this paper, we study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to all those PDEs corresponding to the Hamiltonian form of the massive curved Dirac equation in (1 + 1) dimensions. Therefore a certain QW, which we make explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of the electron as a test particle in curved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice. Mathematically we have introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW, but which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction (QEC) entails the encoding of quantum information into a QEC code space, measuring error syndromes to properly locate and identify errors, and, if necessary, applying a proper recovery operation. Here we compare three syndrome measurement protocols for the [[7,1,3]] QEC code: Shor states, Steane states, and one ancilla qubit by simulating the implementation of 50 logical gates with the syndrome measurements interspersed between the gates at different intervals. We then compare the fidelities for the different syndrome measurement types. Our simulations show that the optimal syndrome measurement strategy is generally not to apply syndrome measurements after every gate but depends on the details of the error environment. Our simulations also allow a quantum computer programmer to weigh computational accuracy versus resource consumption (time and number of qubits) for a particular error environment. In addition, we show that applying syndrome measurements that are unnecessary from the standpoint of quantum fault tolerance may be helpful in achieving better accuracy or in lowering resource consumption. Finally, our simulations demonstrate that the single-qubit non-fault tolerant syndrome measurement strategy achieves comparable fidelity to those that are fault tolerant.

<p>
We consider a quantum relay which is used by two parties to perform several continuous-variable protocols: Entanglement swapping, distillation, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. The theory of these protocols is extended to a non-Markovian model of decoherence characterized by correlated Gaussian noise. Even if bipartite entanglement is completely lost at the relay, we show that the various protocols can progressively be reactivated by the separable noise-correlations of the environment. In fact, above a critical amount, these correlations are able to restore the distribution of quadripartite entanglement, which can be localized into an exploitable bipartite form by the action of the relay. Our findings are confirmed by a proof-of-principle experiment and show the potential advantages of non-Markovian effects in a quantum network architecture.

Parity measurement is a key step in many entanglement generation and quantum error correction schemes. We propose a protocol for non-destructive parity measurement of two remote qubits, i.e., macroscopically separated qubits with no direct interaction. The qubits are instead dispersively coupled to separate resonators that radiate to shared photodetectors. The scheme is deterministic in the sense that there is no fundamental bound on the success probability. Compared to previous proposals, our protocol addresses the scenario where number resolving photodetectors are available but the qubit-resonator coupling is time-independent and only dispersive.

We investigate the Rabi oscillation of an atom placed inside a quantum cavity where each mirror is formed by a chain of atoms trapped near a one-dimensional waveguide. This proposal was studied previously with the use of Markov approximation, where the delay due to the finite travel time of light between the two cavity mirrors is neglected. We show that Rabi oscillation analogous to that obtained with high-finesse classical cavities is achieved only when this travel time is much larger than the time scale that characterizes the collective response of the atomic chain. Therefore, the delay must be taken into account and the dynamics of the problem is inherently non-Markovian. Parameters of interest such as the Rabi frequency and the cavity loss rate due to photon leakage through the mirrors are obtained.

<p>
Although quantum walks exhibit distinctive properties that distinguish them from random walks, classical behavior can be recovered in the asymptotic limit by destroying the coherence of the pure state associated to the quantum system. Here I show that this is not the only way: I introduce a quantum walk driven by an inhomogeneous, time-dependent coin operator, which mimics the statistical properties of a random walk at all time scales. The quantum particle undergoes unitary evolution and, in fact, the high correlation evidenced by the components of the wave function can be used to revert the outcome of an accidental measurement of its chirality.

<p>
The numerical study of anyonic systems is known to be highly challenging due to their non-bosonic, non-fermionic particle exchange statistics, and with the exception of certain models for which analytical solutions exist, very little is known about their collective behaviour as a result. Meanwhile, the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) algorithm is an exceptionally powerful numerical technique for calculating the ground state of a low-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian, and has been applied to the study of bosonic, fermionic, and group-symmetric systems. The recent development of a tensor network formulation for anyonic systems opened up the possibility of studying these systems using algorithms such as DMRG, though this has proved challenging both in terms of programming complexity and computational cost. This paper presents the implementation of DMRG for finite anyonic systems, including a detailed scheme for the implementation of anyonic tensors with optimal scaling of computational cost. The anyonic DMRG algorithm is demonstrated by calculating the ground state energy of the Golden Chain, which has become the benchmark system for the numerical study of anyons, and is shown to produce results comparable to those of the anyonic TEBD algorithm and superior to the variationally optimised anyonic MERA, at far lesser computational cost.

This is the first one of a series of papers about zeta regularization of the divergences appearing in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of several local and global observables in quantum field theory. More precisely we consider a quantized, neutral scalar field on a domain in any spatial dimension, with arbitrary boundary conditions and, possibly, in presence of an external classical potential. We analyze, in particular, the VEV of the stress-energy tensor, the corresponding boundary forces and the total energy, thus taking into account both local and global aspects of the Casimir effect. In comparison with the wide existing literature on these subjects, we try to develop a more systematic approach, allowing to treat specific configurations by mere application of a general machinery. The present Part I is mainly devoted to setting up this general framework; at the end of the paper, this is exemplified in a very simple case. In Parts II, III and IV we will consider more engaging applications, indicated in the Introduction of the present work.

The search for non-Newtonian forces has been pursued following many different paths. Recently it was suggested that hypothetical chameleon interactions, which might explain the mechanisms behind dark energy, could be detected in a high-precision force measurement. In such an experiment, interactions between parallel plates kept at constant separation could be measured as a function of the pressure of an ambient gas, thereby identifying chameleon interactions by their unique inverse dependence on the local mass density. During the past years we have been developing a new kind of setup complying with the high requirements of the proposed experiment. In this article we present the first and most important part of this setup -- the force sensor. We discuss its design, fabrication, and characterization. From the results of the latter we derive limits on chameleon interaction parameters that could be set by the forthcoming experiment. Finally, we describe the opportunity to use the same setup to measure Casimir forces at large surface separations with unprecedented accuracy, thereby potentially giving unambiguous answers to long standing open questions.

We propose a method for acting on the spin state of a spin-1/2 localized particle, or `qubit&#39;, by means of a magnetic signal effectively generated by the nearby transit of a magnetic soliton, there conveyed through a transmission line. We first introduce the specific magnetic soliton of which we will make use, and briefly review the properties that make it apt to represent a signal. We then show that a Heisenberg spin chain can serve as transmission line, and propose a method for injecting a soliton into the chain by acting just on one of its ends. We finally demonstrate that the resulting magnetic pulse can indeed cause, just passing by the spin-1/2 localized particle embodying the qubit, a permanent change in its spin state, thus realizing the possibility of getting through to a single, localized qubit, and manipulate its state. A thorough analysis of how the overall dynamical system operates depending on the setting of its parameters demonstrates that fine tuning is not necessary as it exists an extended region in the parameters space that corresponds to an effective functioning. Moreover, we show that possible noise on the transmission line does not invalidate the scheme.

Quantum walks, whose dynamics is prescribed by alternating unitary coin and shift operators, possess topological phases akin to those of Floquet topological insulators, driven by a time-periodic field. While there is ample theoretical work on topological phases of quantum walks where the coin operators are spin rotations, in experiments a different coin, the Hadamard operator is often used instead. This was the case in a recent photonic quantum walk experiment, where protected edge states were observed between two bulks whose topological invariants, as calculated by the standard theory, were the same. This hints at a hidden topological invariant in the Hadamard quantum walk. We establish a relation between the Hadamard and the spin rotation operator, which allows us to apply the recently developed theory of topological phases of quantum walks to the one-dimensional Hadamard quantum walk. The topological invariants we derive account for the edge state observed in the experiment, we thus reveal the hidden topological invariant of the one-dimensional Hadamard quantum walk.

A route toward lineshape engineering of Fano resonances in photonic structures is theoretically proposed, which uses dynamic modulation of the refractive index of a microcavity. The method is exemplified by considering coupled-resonator optical waveguide systems. An exact Floquet analysis, based on coupled-mode theory, is presented. Two distinct kinds of resonances can be dynamically created, depending on whether the static structure sustains a localized mode or not. In the former case a single Fano resonance arises, which can be tuned in both frequency and line width by varying the refractive index modulation amplitude and frequency. In the latter case two resonances, in the form of narrow asymmetric dips in the transmittance, are found, which can overlap resulting in an electromagnetically-induced transparency effect.

<p>
Quantum walks are promising for information processing tasks because on regular graphs they spread quadratically faster than random walks. Static disorder, however, can turn the tables: unlike random walks, quantum walks can suffer Anderson localization, whereby the spread of the walker stays within a finite region even in the infinite time limit. It is therefore important to understand when we can expect a quantum walk to be Anderson localized and when we can expect it to spread to infinity even in the presence of disorder. In this work we analyze the response of a generic one-dimensional quantum walk -- the split-step walk -- to different forms of static disorder. We find that introducing static, symmetry-preserving disorder in the parameters of the walk leads to Anderson localization. In the completely disordered limit, however, a delocalization sets in, and the walk spreads subdiffusively. Using an efficient numerical algorithm, we calculate the bulk topological invariants of the disordered walk, and interpret the disorder-induced Anderson localization and delocalization transitions using these invariants.

<p><strong>49.    Entropy production in quantum Yang-Mills mechanics in semi-classical approximation</strong><br>

<p>
We discuss thermalization of isolated quantum systems by using the Husimi-Wehrl entropy evaluated in the semiclassical treatment. The Husimi-Wehrl entropy is the Wehrl entropy obtained by using the Husimi function for the phase space distribution. The time evolution of the Husimi function is given by smearing the Wigner function, whose time evolution is obtained in the semiclassical approximation. We show the efficiency and usefullness of this semiclassical treatment in describing entropy production of a couple of quantum mechanical systems, whose classical counter systems are known to be chaotic. We propose two methods to evaluate the time evolution of the Husimi-Wehrl entropy, the test-particle method and the two-step Monte-Carlo method. We demonstrate the characteristics of the two methods by numerical calculations, and show that the simultaneous application of the two methods ensures the reliability of the results of the Husimi-Wehrl entropy at a given time.

<p><strong>50.    Lattice topology and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays</strong><br>
Daniel Leykam, Alexander S. Solntsev, Andrey A. Sukhorukov, Anton S. Desyatnikov<br>
Phys. Rev. A 92, 033815 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.04850">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.04850</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze spontaneous parametric down-conversion in various experimentally feasible 1D quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays, with emphasis on the relationship between the lattice&#39;s topological invariants and the biphoton correlations. Nontrivial topology results in a nontrivial &quot;winding&quot; of the array&#39;s Bloch waves, which introduces additional selection rules for the generation of biphotons. These selection rules are in addition to, and independent of existing control using the pump beam&#39;s spatial profile and phase matching conditions. In finite lattices, nontrivial topology produces single photon edge modes, resulting in &quot;hybrid&quot; biphoton edge modes, with one photon localized at the edge and the other propagating into the bulk. When the single photon band gap is sufficiently large, these hybrid biphoton modes reside in a band gap of the bulk biphoton Bloch wave spectrum. Numerical simulations support our analytical results.

<p><strong>51.    Dynamical Quasicondensation of Hard-Core Bosons at Finite Momenta</strong><br>
L. Vidmar, J. P. Ronzheimer, M. Schreiber, S. Braun, S. S. Hodgman, S. Langer, F. Heidrich-Meisner, I. Bloch, U. Schneider<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.05150">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.05150</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Long-range order in quantum many-body systems is usually associated with equilibrium situations. Here, we experimentally investigate the quasicondensation of strongly-interacting bosons at finite momenta in a far-from-equilibrium case. We prepare an inhomogeneous initial state consisting of one-dimensional Mott insulators in the center of otherwise empty one-dimensional chains in an optical lattice with a lattice constant $d$. After suddenly quenching the trapping potential to zero, we observe the onset of coherence in spontaneously forming quasicondensates in the lattice. Remarkably, the emerging phase order differs from the ground-state order and is characterized by peaks at finite momenta $\pm (\pi/2) (\hbar / d)$ in the momentum distribution function.

<p><strong>52.    Modulation-assisted tunneling in laser-fabricated photonic Wannier-Stark ladders</strong><br>
Sebabrata Mukherjee, Alexander Spracklen, Debaditya Choudhury, Nathan Goldman, Patrik ?hberg, Erika Andersson, Robert R. Thomson<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.05217">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.05217</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We observe Wannier-Stark localization in curved photonic lattices, realized using arrays of evanescently coupled optical waveguides. By correctly tuning the strength of inter-site coupling in the lattice, we observe that Wannier-Stark states become increasingly localized, and eventually fully localized to one site, as the curvature of the lattice is increased. We then demonstrate that tunneling can be successfully restored in the lattice by applying a sinusoidal modulation to the lattice position, an effect that is a direct analogue of photon-assisted tunneling. This precise tuning of the tunneling matrix elements, through laser-fabricated on-site modulations, opens a novel route for the creation of gauge fields in photonic lattices.

<p><strong>53.    Space qualified nanosatellite electronics platform for photon pair experiments</strong><br>
Cliff Cheng, Rakhitha Chandrasekara, Yue Chuan Tan, Alexander Ling<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.06523">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1505.06523</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report the design and implementation of a complete electronics platform for conducting a quantum optics experiment that will be operated on board a 1U CubeSat (a 10 x 10 x 10 cm satellite). The quantum optics experiment is designed to produce polarization-entangled photon pairs using non-linear optical crystals and requires opto-electronic components such as a pump laser, single photon detectors and liquid crystal based polarization rotators in addition to passive optical elements. The platform provides mechanical support for the optical assembly. It also communicates autonomously with the host satellite to provide experiment data for transmission to a ground station. A limited number of commands can be transmitted from ground to the platform enabling it to switch experimental modes. This platform requires less than 1.5W for all operations, and is space qualified. The implementation of this electronics platform is a major step on the road to operating quantum communication experiments using nanosatellites.
