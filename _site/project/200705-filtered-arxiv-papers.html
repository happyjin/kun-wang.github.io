    <p><strong>1.    An analytic solution for one-dimensional quantum walks</strong><br>
Ian Fuss, Lang White, Peter Sherman, Sanjeev Naguleswaran<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0077">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0077</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The first general analytic solutions for the one-dimensional walk in position and momentum space are derived. These solutions reveal, among other things, new symmetry features of quantum walk probability densities and further insight into the behaviour of their moments. The analytic expressions for the quantum walk probability distributions provide a means of modelling quantum phenomena that is analogous to that provided by random walks in the classical domain.

By means of analytical and numerical methods we analyze the phase diagram of polaritons in one-dimensional coupled cavities. We locate the phase boundary, discuss the behavior of the polariton compressibility and visibility fringes across the critical point, and find a non-trivial scaling of the phase boundary as a function of the number of atoms inside each cavity. We also predict the emergence of a polaritonic glassy phase when the number of atoms fluctuates from cavity to cavity.

<p><strong>6.    Experimental approaches to the difference in the Casimir force through the varying optical properties of boundary surface</strong><br>
R. Castillo-Garza, C.-C. Chang, D. Jimenez, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko, U. Mohideen<br>
Phys.Rev.A75:062114,2007<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1358">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1358</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose two novel experiments on the measurement of the Casimir force acting between a gold coated sphere and semiconductor plates with markedly different charge carrier densities. In the first of these experiments a patterned Si plate is used which consists of two sections of different dopant densities and oscillates in the horizontal direction below a sphere. The measurement scheme in this experiment is differential, i.e., allows the direct high-precision measurement of the difference of the Casimir forces between the sphere and sections of the patterned plate or the difference of the equivalent pressures between Au and patterned parallel plates with static and dynamic techniques, respectively. The second experiment proposes to measure the Casimir force between the same sphere and a VO${}_2$ film which undergoes the insulator-metal phase transition with the increase of temperature. We report the present status of the interferometer based variable temperature apparatus developed to perform both experiments and present the first results on the calibration and sensitivity. The magnitudes of the Casimir forces and pressures in the experimental configurations are calculated using different theoretical approaches to the description of optical and conductivity properties of semiconductors at low frequencies proposed in the literature. It is shown that the suggested experiments will aid in the resolution of theoretical problems arising in the application of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to real materials. They will also open new opportunities in nanotechnology.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum Markovian Subsystems: Invariance, Attractivity, and Control</strong><br>
Francesco Ticozzi, Lorenza Viola<br>
IEEE Transaction on Automatic Control, 53(9):2048-2063, 2008<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1372">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1372</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We characterize the dynamical behavior of continuous-time, Markovian quantum systems with respect to a subsystem of interest. Markovian dynamics describes a wide class of open quantum systems of relevance to quantum information processing, subsystem encodings offering a general pathway to faithfully represent quantum information. We provide explicit linear-algebraic characterizations of the notion of invariant and noiseless subsystem for Markovian master equations, under different robustness assumptions for model-parameter and initial-state variations. The stronger concept of an attractive quantum subsystem is introduced, and sufficient existence conditions are identified based on Lyapunov&#39;s stability techniques. As a main control application, we address the potential of output-feedback Markovian control strategies for quantum pure state-stabilization and noiseless-subspace generation. In particular, explicit results for the synthesis of stabilizing semigroups and noiseless subspaces in finite-dimensional Markovian systems are obtained.

<p><strong>8.    The Quantum Query Complexity of Algebraic Properties</strong><br>
Sebastian Doern, Thomas Thierauf<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1446">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1446</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present quantum query complexity bounds for testing algebraic properties. For a set S and a binary operation on S, we consider the decision problem whether $S$ is a semigroup or has an identity element. If S is a monoid, we want to decide whether S is a group. We present quantum algorithms for these problems that improve the best known classical complexity bounds. In particular, we give the first application of the new quantum random walk technique by Magniez, Nayak, Roland, and Santha that improves the previous bounds by Ambainis and Szegedy. We also present several lower bounds for testing algebraic properties.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum Error Correction of Observables</strong><br>
Cedric Beny, Achim Kempf, David W. Kribs<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
A formalism for quantum error correction based on operator algebras was introduced in [1] via consideration of the Heisenberg picture for quantum dynamics. The resulting theory allows for the correction of hybrid quantum-classical information and does not require an encoded state to be entirely in one of the corresponding subspaces or subsystems. Here, we provide detailed proofs for the results of [1], derive a number of new results, and we elucidate key points with expanded discussions. We also present several examples and indicate how the theory can be extended to operator spaces and general positive operator-valued measures.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum transport on small-world networks: A continuous-time quantum walk approach</strong><br>
Oliver Muelken, Volker Pernice, Alexander Blumen<br>
Phys. Rev. E 76, 051125 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1608">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1608</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the quantum mechanical transport of (coherent) excitons on small-world networks (SWN). The SWN are build from a one-dimensional ring of N nodes by randomly introducing B additional bonds between them. The exciton dynamics is modeled by continuous-time quantum walks and we evaluate numerically the ensemble averaged transition probability to reach any node of the network from the initially excited one. For sufficiently large B we find that the quantum mechanical transport through the SWN is, first, very fast, given that the limiting value of the transition probability is reached very quickly; second, that the transport does not lead to equipartition, given that on average the exciton is most likely to be found at the initial node.

We investigate the dynamics of a continuous atom laser based on the merging of independently formed atomic condensates. In a first attempt to understand the dynamics of the system, we consider two independent elongated Bose-Einstein condensates which approach each other and focus on intermediate inter-trap distances so that a two-mode model is well justified. In the framework of a mean-field theory, we discuss the quasi steady-state population of the traps as well as the energy distribution of the outcoupled atoms.

<p>
We study theoretically two coupled periodically-curved optical waveguides with Kerr nonlinearity. We find that the tunneling between the waveguides can be suppressed in a wide range of parameters due to nonlinearity. Such suppression of tunneling is different from the coherent destruction of tunneling in a linear medium, which occurs only at the isolated degeneracy point of the quasienergies. We call this novel suppression nonlinear coherent destruction of tunneling.

<p><strong>13.    Quantum Measurement as a Final-State Interaction with a Macroscopic External System</strong><br>
K.-E. Eriksson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1649">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1649</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) is studied in interaction with a large system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the microsystem in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as compared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis is carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking place within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variables in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the microsystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state. Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude for the microsystem is highly non-linear. In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the ensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an entangled state. For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is instead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector states (reduction of the wave packet).

During this computation, genuine multiparticle entanglement is observed which well supports its quantum nature.

We give a scheme for loss tolerantly building a linear optical quantum memory which itself is tolerant to qubit loss. We use the encoding recently introduced in [Phys. Rev.

Our results suggest that it is possible to build a loss tolerant quantum memory, such that if the requirement is to keep the data stored over arbitrarily long times then this is possible with only polynomially increasing resources and logarithmically increasing individual photon life times.

We study the motion of two non-interacting quantum particles performing a random walk on a line and analyze the probability that the two particles are detected at a particular position after a certain number of steps (meeting problem). The results are compared to the corresponding classical problem and differences are pointed out. Analytic formulas for the meeting probability and its asymptotic behavior are derived. The decay of the meeting probability for distinguishable particles is faster then in the classical case, but not quadratically faster. Entangled initial states and the bosonic or fermionic nature of the walkers are considered.

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the recurrence probability (P\&#39;olya number) for d-dimensional unbiased quantum walks. A sufficient condition for a quantum walk to be recurrent is derived. As a by-product we find a simple criterion for localisation of quantum walks. In contrast to classical walks, where the P\&#39;olya number is characteristic for the given dimension, the recurrence probability of a quantum walk depends in general on the topology of the walk, choice of the coin and the initial state. This allows to change the character of the quantum walk from recurrent to transient by altering the initial state.

<p><strong>18.    Continuous quantum error correction for non-Markovian decoherence</strong><br>
Ognyan Oreshkov, Todd A. Brun<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 022318 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2342">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2342</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effect of continuous quantum error correction in the case where each qubit in a codeword is subject to a general Hamiltonian interaction with an independent bath. We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivial single-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings of continuous error correction and the difference between Markovian and non-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze the range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales. Finally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the performance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative characteristics.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2472">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2472</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We microscopically model the decoherence dynamics of entangled coherent states under the influence of vacuum fluctuation. We derive an exact master equation with time-dependent coefficients reflecting the memory effect of the environment, by using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional theory in the coherent-state representation. Under the Markovian approximation, our master equation recovers the widely used Lindblad equation in quantum optics. We then investigate the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of the quantum channel in terms of the entangled coherent states under noise. Compared with the results in Markovian limit, it shows that the non-Markovian effect enhances the disentanglement to the initially entangled coherent state. Our analysis also shows that the decoherence behaviors of the entangled coherent states depend sensitively on the symmetrical properties of the entangled coherent states as well as the interactions between the system and the environment.

<blockquote>
<p>
Given the extensive application of classical random walks to classical algorithms in a variety of fields, their quantum analogue in quantum walks is expected to provide a fruitful source of quantum algorithms. So far, however, such algorithms have been scarce. In this work, we enumerate some important differences between quantum and classical walks, leading to their markedly different properties. We show that for many practical purposes, the implementation of quantum walks can be efficiently achieved using a classical computer. We then develop both classical and quantum graph isomorphism algorithms based on discrete-time quantum walks. We show that they are effective in identifying isomorphism classes of large databases of graphs, in particular groups of strongly regular graphs. We consider this approach to represent a promising candidate for an efficient solution to the graph isomorphism problem, and believe that similar methods employing quantum walks, or derivatives of these walks, may prove beneficial in constructing other algorithms for a variety of purposes.

We predict that the effective nonlinear optical susceptibility can be tailored using the Purcell effect.

We show theoretically that using the Purcell effect for frequencies close to an atomic resonance can substantially influence the resultant Kerr nonlinearity for light of all (even highly detuned) frequencies. For example, in realistic physical systems, enhancement of the Kerr coefficient by one to two orders of magnitude could be achieved.

A detailed analysis of the wave-mode structure in a bend and its incorporation into a stable algorithm for calculation of the scattering matrix of the bend is presented. The calculations are based on the modal approach. The stability and precision of the algorithm is numerically and analytically analysed. The algorithm enables precise numerical calculations of scattering across the bend. The reflection is a purely quantum phenomenon and is discussed in more detail over a larger energy interval. The behaviour of the reflection is explained partially by a one-dimensional scattering model and heuristic calculations of the scattering matrix for narrow bends. In the same spirit we explain the numerical results for the Wigner-Smith delay time in the bend.

<p><strong>28.    Virtual photons in imaginary time: Computing exact Casimir forces via standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques</strong><br>
Alejandro Rodriguez, Mihai Ibanescu, Davide Iannuzzi, J. D. Joannopoulos, Steven G. Johnson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3661">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3661</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary accuracy (given sufficient computational resources). Our approach, based on well-established integration of the mean stress tensor evaluated via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is designed to directly exploit fast methods developed for classical computational electromagnetism, since it only involves repeated evaluation of the Green&#39;s function for imaginary frequencies (equivalently, real frequencies in imaginary time). We develop the approach by systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries such as a cylinder and a plate, and apply it to new geometries. In particular, we show that a piston-like geometry of two squares sliding between metal walls, in both two and three dimensions with both perfect and realistic metallic materials, exhibits a surprising non-monotonic ``lateral&#39;&#39; force from the walls.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the quest for signatures of coherent transport we consider exciton trapping in the continuous-time quantum walk framework. The survival probability displays different decay domains, related to distinct regions of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. For linear systems and at intermediate times the decay obeys a power-law, in contrast to the corresponding exponential decay found in incoherent continuous-time random walk situations. To differentiate between the coherent and incoherent mechanisms, we present an experimental protocol based on a frozen Rydberg gas structured by optical dipole traps.

IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking 17(3), 1002-1013, 2009<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4128">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4128</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new control algorithm and system design for a network of quantum repeaters, and outline the end-to-end protocol architecture. Such a network will create long-distance quantum states, supporting quantum key distribution as well as distributed quantum computation. Quantum repeaters improve the reduction of quantum-communication throughput with distance from exponential to polynomial. Because a quantum state cannot be copied, a quantum repeater is not a signal amplifier, but rather executes algorithms for quantum teleportation in conjunction with a specialized type of quantum error correction called purification to raise the fidelity of the quantum states. We introduce our banded purification scheme, which is especially effective when the fidelity of coupled qubits is low, improving the prospects for experimental realization of such systems. The resulting throughput is calculated via detailed simulations of a long line composed of shorter hops. Our algorithmic improvements increase throughput by a factor of up to fifty compared to earlier approaches, for a broad range of physical characteristics.

<blockquote>
<p>
We give a review on entanglement purification for bipartite and multipartite quantum states, with the main focus on theoretical work carried out by our group in the last couple of years. We discuss entanglement purification in the context of quantum communication, where we emphasize its close relation to quantum error correction. Various bipartite and multipartite entanglement purification protocols are discussed, and their performance under idealized and realistic conditions is studied. Several applications of entanglement purification in quantum communication and computation are presented, which highlights the fact that entanglement purification is a fundamental tool in quantum information processing.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4360">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4360</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we place bounds on when it is impossible to purify a noisy two-qubit state if all the gates used in the purification protocol are subject to adversarial local, independent, noise. It is found that the gate operations must be subject to less than 5.3% error. An existing proof that purification is equivalent to error correction is used to show that this bound can also be applied to concatenated error correcting codes in the presence of noisy gates, and hence gives a limit to the tolerable error rate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer formed by concatenation. This is shown to apply also to the case where error detection and post-selection, as proposed by Knill, is used to enhance the threshold. We demonstrate the trade-off between gate/environmentally induced faulty rotations and qubit loss errors.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4595">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4595</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate an unconditional high-fidelity teleporter capable of preserving the broadband entanglement in an optical squeezed state. In particular, we teleport a squeezed state of light and observe $-0.8 \pm 0.2$dB of squeezing in the teleported (output) state. We show that the squeezing criterion translates directly into a sufficient criterion for entanglement of the upper and lower sidebands of the optical field. Thus, this result demonstrates the first unconditional teleportation of broadband entanglement. Our teleporter achieves sufficiently high fidelity to allow the teleportation to be cascaded, enabling, in principle, the construction of deterministic non-Gaussian operations.

<p><strong>37.    Modifying quantum walks: A scattering theory approach</strong><br>
Edgar Feldman, Mark Hillery<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4612">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4612</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to construct discrete-time quantum walks on directed, Eulerian graphs. These graphs have tails on which the particle making the walk propagates freely, and this makes it possible to analyze the walks in terms of scattering theory. The probability of entering a graph from one tail and leaving from another can be found from the scattering matrix of the graph. We show how the scattering matrix of a graph that is an automorphic image of the original is related to the scattering matrix of the original graph, and we show how the scattering matrix of the reverse graph is related to that of the original graph. Modifications of graphs and the effects of these modifications are then considered. In particular we show how the scattering matrix of a graph is changed if we remove two tails and replace them with an edge or cut an edge and add two tails. This allows us to combine graphs, that is if we connect two graphs we can construct the scattering matrix of the combined graph from those of its parts. Finally, using these techniques, we show how two graphs can be compared by constructing a larger larger graph in which the two original graphs are in parallel, and performing a quantum walk on the larger graph. This is a kind of quantum walk interferometry.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0937">http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0937</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The two and three-body correlation functions of the ground state of an optically trapped ultracold spin-1/2 Fermi gas (SFG) in a tight waveguide (1D regime) are calculated in the plane of even and odd-wave coupling constants, assuming a 1D attractive zero-range odd-wave interaction induced by a 3D p-wave Feshbach resonance, as well as the usual repulsive zero-range even-wave interaction stemming from 3D s-wave scattering. The calculations are based on the exact mapping from the SFG to a ``Lieb-Liniger-Heisenberg&#39;&#39; model with delta-function repulsions depending on isotropic Heisenberg spin-spin interactions, and indicate that the SFG should be stable against three-body recombination in a large region of the coupling constant plane encompassing parts of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. However, the limiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG), a spin-aligned 1D Fermi gas with infinitely attractive p-wave interactions, is unstable in this sense. Effects due to the dipolar interaction and a Zeeman term due to a resonance-generating magnetic field do not lead to shrinkage of the region of stability of the SFG.

<blockquote>
<p>
Molecular biology is a nanotechnology that works--it has worked for billions of years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system for acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from viruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the optimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of basic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing tasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these languages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about what we may design or convert ourselves into.
