<p><strong>2.    Robust Control of Quantum Information</strong><br>
Marco A. Pravia, Nicolas Boulant, Joseph Emerson, Amro Farid, Evan M. Fortunato, Timothy F. Havel, David G. Cory<br>
J. of Chem. Phys. 119, 19: 9993-10001 (2003).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307062">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307062</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Errors in the control of quantum systems may be classified as unitary, decoherent and incoherent. Unitary errors are systematic, and result in a density matrix that differs from the desired one by a unitary operation. Decoherent errors correspond to general completely positive superoperators, and can only be corrected using methods such as quantum error correction. Incoherent errors can also be described, on average, by completely positive superoperators, but can nevertheless be corrected by the application of a locally unitary operation that ``refocuses&#39;&#39; them. They are due to reproducible spatial or temporal variations in the system&#39;s Hamiltonian, so that information on the variations is encoded in the system&#39;s spatiotemporal state and can be used to correct them. In this paper liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is used to demonstrate that such refocusing effects can be built directly into the control fields, where the incoherence arises from spatial inhomogeneities in the quantizing static magnetic field as well as the radio-frequency control fields themselves. Using perturbation theory, it is further shown that the eigenvalue spectrum of the completely positive superoperator exhibits a characteristic spread that contains information on the Hamiltonians&#39; underlying distribution.

<p><strong>3.    The interpretation of non-Markovian stochastic Schr?dinger equations as a hidden-variable theory</strong><br>
Jay Gambetta, H. M. Wiseman<br>
Phys. Rev. A 68, 062104 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307078">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307078</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do diffusive non-Markovian stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger equations (SSEs) for open quantum systems have a physical interpretation? In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A 66, 012108 (2002)] we investigated this question using the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. We found that the solution of a non-Markovian SSE represents the state the system would be in at that time if a measurement was performed on the environment at that time, and yielded a particular result. However, the linking of solutions at different times to make a trajectory is, we concluded, a fiction. In this paper we investigate this question using the modal (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics. We find that the noise function $z(t)$ appearing in the non-Markovian SSE can be interpreted as a hidden variable for the environment. That is, some chosen property (beable) of the environment has a definite value $z(t)$ even in the absence of measurement on the environment. The non-Markovian SSE gives the evolution of the state of the system ``conditioned&#39;&#39; on this environment hidden variable. We present the theory for diffusive non-Markovian SSEs that have as their Markovian limit SSEs corresponding to homodyne and heterodyne detection, as well as one which has no Markovian limit.

<p><strong>5.    The statistical strength of nonlocality proofs</strong><br>
Wim van Dam, Peter Grunwald, Richard Gill<br>
IEEE-Transactions on Information Theory 51 (2005), 2812-2835<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307125">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307125</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
There exist numerous proofs of Bell&#39;s theorem, stating that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local realistic theories of nature. Here we define the strength of such nonlocality proofs in terms of the amount of evidence against local realism provided by the corresponding experiments. This measure tells us how many trials of the experiment we should perform in order to observe a substantial violation of local realism. Statistical considerations show that the amount of evidence should be measured by the Kullback-Leibler or relative entropy divergence between the probability distributions over the measurement outcomes that the respective theories predict. The statistical strength of a nonlocality proof is thus determined by the experimental implementation of it that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from experimental (quantum mechanical) truth to the set of all possible local theories. An implementation includes a specification with which probabilities the different measurement settings are sampled, and hence the maximization is done over all such setting distributions. We analyze two versions of Bell&#39;s nonlocality proof (his original proof and an optimized version by Peres), and proofs by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt, Hardy, Mermin, and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger. We find that the GHZ proof is at least four and a half times stronger than all other proofs, while of the two-party proofs, the one of CHSH is the strongest.

<p><strong>6.    Comment on &quot;Quantum identification schemes with entanglements&quot;</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
In a recent paper, [Phys. Rev. A 65, 052326 (2002)], Mihara presented several cryptographic protocols that were claimed to be quantum mechanical in nature. In this comment it is pointed out that these protocols can be described in purely classical terms. Hence, the security of these schemes does not rely on the usage of entanglement or any other quantum mechanical property.

<p><strong>7.    Multi-party entanglement in graph states</strong><br>
M. Hein, J. Eisert, H.J. Briegel<br>
Phys. Rev. A 69, 062311 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307130">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307130</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Graph states are multi-particle entangled states that correspond to mathematical graphs, where the vertices of the graph take the role of quantum spin systems and edges represent Ising interactions. They are many-body spin states of distributed quantum systems that play a significant role in quantum error correction, multi-party quantum communication, and quantum computation within the framework of the one-way quantum computer. We characterize and quantify the genuine multi-particle entanglement of such graph states in terms of the Schmidt measure, to which we provide upper and lower bounds in graph theoretical terms. Several examples and classes of graphs will be discussed, where these bounds coincide. These examples include trees, cluster states of different dimension, graphs that occur in quantum error correction, such as the concatenated [7,1,3]-CSS code, and a graph associated with the quantum Fourier transform in the one-way computer. We also present general transformation rules for graphs when local Pauli measurements are applied, and give criteria for the equivalence of two graphs up to local unitary transformations, employing the stabilizer formalism. For graphs of up to seven vertices we provide complete characterization modulo local unitary transformations and graph isomorphies.

<p><strong>8.    Relation between discrete and continuous teleportation using linear elements</strong><br>
Dirk Witthaut, Michael Fleischhauer<br>
Quant. Inf. Comp. 4, 122 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307140">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307140</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the relation between discrete and continuous linear teleportation, i.e. teleportation schemes that use only linear optical elements and photodetectors. For this the existing qubit protocols are generalized to qudits with a discrete and finite spectrum but with an arbitrary number of states or alternatively to continuous variables. Correspondingly a generalization of linear optical operations and detection is made. It is shown that linear teleportation is only possible in a probabilistic sense. A general expression for the success probability is derived which is shown to depend only on the dimensions of the input and ancilla Hilbert spaces. From this the known results $p=1/2$ and $p=1$ for the discrete and continuous cases can be recovered. We also discuss the probabilistic teleportation scheme of Knill, Laflamme and Milburn and argue that it does not make optimum use of resources.

<p><strong>9.    Analysis of Grover&#39;s quantum search algorithm as a dynamical system</strong><br>
O. Biham, D. Shapira, Y. Shimoni<br>
Phys. Rev. A 68, 022326 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307141">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307141</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover&#39;s quantum search algorithm is analyzed for the case in which the initial state is an arbitrary pure quantum state $|\phi&gt;$ of $n$ qubits. It is shown that the optimal time to perform the measurement is independent of $| \phi&gt;$, namely, it is identical to the optimal time in the original algorithm in which $| \phi &gt; = | 0&gt;$, with the same number of marked states, $r$. The probability of success $P_{\rm s}$ is obtained, in terms of the amplitudes of the state $| \phi&gt;$, and is shown to be independent of $r$. A class of states, which includes fixed points and cycles of the Grover iteration operator is identified. The relevance of these results in the context of using the success probability as an entanglement measure is discussed. In particular, the Groverian entanglement measure, previously limited to a single marked state, is generalized to the case of several marked states.

<p><strong>10.    The effect of unitary noise on Grover&#39;s quantum search algorithm</strong><br>
D. Shapira, S. Mozes, O. Biham<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307142">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307142</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The effect of unitary noise on the performance of Grover&#39;s quantum search algorithm is studied. This type of noise may result from tiny fluctuations and drift in the parameters of the (quantum) components performing the computation. The resulting operations are still unitary, but not precisely those assumed in the design of the algorithm. Here we focus on the effect of such noise in the Hadamard gate $W$, which is an essential component in each iteration of the quantum search process. To this end $W$ is replaced by a noisy Hadamard gate $U$. The parameters of $U$ at each iteration are taken from an arbitrary probability distribution (e.g. Gaussian distribution) and are characterized by their statistical moments around the parameters of $W$. For simplicity we assume that the noise is unbiased and isotropic, namely all noise variables in the parametrization we use have zero average and the same standard deviation $\epsilon$. The noise terms at different calls to $U$ are assumed to be uncorrelated. For a search space of size $N=2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of qubits used to span this space) it is found that as long as $\epsilon &lt; O(n^{-{1/2}} N^{-{1/4}})$, the algorithm maintains significant efficiency, while above this noise level its operation is hampered completely. It is also found that below this noise threshold, when the search fails, it is likely to provide a state that differs from the marked state by only a few bits. This feature can be used to search for the marked state by a classical post-processing, even if the quantum search has failed, thus improving the success rate of the search process.

<p><strong>11.    Lower Bounds for Local Search by Quantum Arguments</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307149">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307149</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The problem of finding a local minimum of a black-box function is central for understanding local search as well as quantum adiabatic algorithms. For functions on the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n, we show a lower bound of Omega(2^{n/4}/n) on the number of queries needed by a quantum computer to solve this problem. More surprisingly, our approach, based on Ambainis&#39; quantum adversary method, also yields a lower bound of Omega(2^{n/2}/n^2) on the problem&#39;s classical randomized query complexity. This improves and simplifies a 1983 result of Aldous. Finally, in both the randomized and quantum cases, we give the first nontrivial lower bounds for finding local minima on grids of constant dimension greater than 2.

<p><strong>12.    A Lambda Calculus for Quantum Computation</strong><br>
Andre van Tonder<br>
SIAM J.Comput. 33 (2004) 1109-1135<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307150">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307150</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The classical lambda calculus may be regarded both as a programming language and as a formal algebraic system for reasoning about computation. It provides a computational model equivalent to the Turing machine, and continues to be of enormous benefit in the classical theory of computation. We propose that quantum computation, like its classical counterpart, may benefit from a version of the lambda calculus suitable for expressing and reasoning about quantum algorithms. In this paper we develop a quantum lambda calculus as an alternative model of quantum computation, which combines some of the benefits of both the quantum Turing machine and the quantum circuit models. The calculus turns out to be closely related to the linear lambda calculi used in the study of Linear Logic. We set up a computational model and an equational proof system for this calculus, and we argue that it is equivalent to the quantum Turing machine.

<p><strong>14.    Hyperentanglement-assisted Bell-state analysis</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307212">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307212</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a simple scheme for complete Bell-state measurement of photons using hyperentangled states - entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. In addition to hyperentanglement, our scheme requires only linear optics and single photon detectors, and is realizable with current technology. At the cost of additional classical communication, our Bell-state measurement can be implemented non-locally. We discuss the possible application of these results to quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation.

<p><strong>15.    On the existence of physical transformations between sets of quantum states</strong><br>
Anthony Chefles, Richard Jozsa, Andreas Winter<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307227">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307227</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let A = {rho_1,...,rho_n} be a given set of quantum states. We consider the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions on another set B = {sigma_1,...,sigma_n} that guarantee the existence of a physical transformation taking rho_i to sigma_i for all i. Uhlmann has given an elegant such condition when both sets comprise pure states. We give a simple proof of this condition and develop some consequences. Then we consider multi-probabilistic transformations between sets of pure states which leads to conditions for the problem of transformability between A and B when one set is pure and the other is arbitrary.
