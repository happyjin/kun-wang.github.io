    <p><strong>1.    Evolution Of Entanglement In Groverian Search Algorithm: Two-Qutrit System</strong><br>
Arti Chamoli, C. M. Bhandari<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609010">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609010</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum processes particularly those pertaining to quantum information and computation. An analytical expression for entanglement measure defined in terms of success rate of Grover&#39;s search algorithm has been obtained for a two-qutrit system and the calculated results agree well with the conventional entropy based measure. Qutrit system are of special interest because the Hilbert space dimensionality (for a given number of qudits-d-dimensional system)is optimal for d=3 and this may be of significance in the enhancement of computing power.

<p><strong>3.    A random walk approach to quantum algorithms</strong><br>
Viv Kendon<br>
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006) 364, 3407-3422<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609035">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609035</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The development of quantum algorithms based on quantum versions of random walks is placed in the context of the emerging field of quantum computing. Constructing a suitable quantum version of a random walk is not trivial: pure quantum dynamics is deterministic, so randomness only enters during the measurement phase, i.e., when converting the quantum information into classical information. The outcome of a quantum random walk is very different from the corresponding classical random walk, due to interference between the different possible paths. The upshot is that quantum walkers find themselves further from their starting point on average than a classical walker, and this forms the basis of a quantum speed up that can be exploited to solve problems faster. Surprisingly, the effect of making the walk slightly less than perfectly quantum can optimize the properties of the quantum walk for algorithmic applications. Looking to the future, with even a small quantum computer available, development of quantum walk algorithms might proceed more rapidly than it has, especially for solving real problems.

<p><strong>4.    Computational Difficulty of Global Variations in the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</strong><br>
J. Eisert<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 260501 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609051">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609051</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach is arguably the most successful method to numerically find ground states of quantum spin chains. It amounts to iteratively locally optimizing matrix-product states, aiming at better and better approximating the true ground state. To date, both a proof of convergence to the globally best approximation and an assessment of its complexity are lacking. Here we establish a result on the computational complexity of an approximation with matrix-product states: The surprising result is that when one globally optimizes over several sites of local Hamiltonians, avoiding local optima, one encounters in the worst case a computationally difficult NP-hard problem (hard even in approximation). The proof exploits a novel way of relating it to binary quadratic programming. We discuss intriguing ramifications on the difficulty of describing quantum many-body systems.

<p><strong>5.    Generation and transfer of single photons on a photonic crystal chip</strong><br>
Dirk Englund, Andrei Faraon, Bingyang Zhang, Yoshihisa Yamamoto, Jelena Vuckovic<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609053">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609053</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a basic building block of a quantum network consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a source cavity, which in turn is coupled to a target cavity via a waveguide. The single photon emission from the high-Q/V source cavity is characterized by a twelve-fold spontaneous emission (SE) rate enhancement that results in a SE coupling efficiency near 0.98 into the source cavity mode. Single photons are efficiently transferred into the target cavity through the waveguide, with a source/target field intensity ratio of 0.12 (up to 0.49 observed in other structures without coupled quantum dots). This system shows great promise as a building block of future on-chip quantum information processing systems.

<p><strong>6.    Groverian entanglement measure and evolution of entanglement in search algorithm for n(=3 and 5)-qubit systems with real coefficients</strong><br>
Arti Chamoli, C. M. Bhandari<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609064">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609064</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Evolution of entanglement with the proceeding of quantum algorithms affects the outcome of the algorithm. Particularly, the performance of Grover&#39;s search algorithm gets worsened if the initial state of the algorithm is an entangled one. The success probability of search can be seen as an operational measure of entanglement. This paper demonstrates an entanglement measure based on the performance of Grover&#39;s search algorithm for three and five qubit systems. We also show that although the overall pattern shows growth of entanglement, its rise to a maximum and then consequent decay, the presence of local fluctuation within each iterative step is likely.

<p><strong>7.    Complete and Deterministic discrimination of polarization Bell state assisted by momentum entanglement</strong><br>
M. Barbieri, G. Vallone, P. Mataloni, F. De Martini<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 042317 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609080">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609080</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A complete and deterministic Bell state measurement was realized by a simple linear optics experimental scheme which adopts 2-photon polarization-momentum hyperentanglement. The scheme, which is based on the discrimination among the single photon Bell states of the hyperentangled state, requires the adoption of standard single photon detectors. The four polarization Bell states have been measured with average fidelity $F=0.889\pm0.010$ by using the linear momentum degree of freedom as the ancilla. The feasibility of the scheme has been characterized as a function of the purity of momentum entanglement.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum Walks in an array of Quantum Dots</strong><br>
K. Manouchehri, J. B. Wang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609088">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609088</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks are shown to have non-intuitive dynamics, which makes them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for well-known classical problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum computing. In this work we propose a novel scheme for the physical implementation of a discrete-time quantum random walk using laser excitations of the electronic states of an array of quantum dots. These dots represent the discrete nodes of the walk, while transitions between the energy levels inside each dot correspond to the required coin operation and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) processes are employed to induce the steps of the walk. The quantum dot design is tailored in such a way as to enable selective coupling of the energy levels. Our simulation results show a close agreement with the ideal quantum walk distribution as well as modest robustness towards noise disturbance.

<p><strong>9.    Weak Fourier-Schur sampling, the hidden subgroup problem, and the quantum collision problem</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Aram W. Harrow, Pawel Wocjan<br>
Proc. 24th Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2007), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4393, pp. 598-609<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609110">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609110</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Schur duality decomposes many copies of a quantum state into subspaces labeled by partitions, a decomposition with applications throughout quantum information theory. Here we consider applying Schur duality to the problem of distinguishing coset states in the standard approach to the hidden subgroup problem. We observe that simply measuring the partition (a procedure we call weak Schur sampling) provides very little information about the hidden subgroup. Furthermore, we show that under quite general assumptions, even a combination of weak Fourier sampling and weak Schur sampling fails to identify the hidden subgroup. We also prove tight bounds on how many coset states are required to solve the hidden subgroup problem by weak Schur sampling, and we relate this question to a quantum version of the collision problem.

<p><strong>10.    Discrete time quantum walk model for single and entangled particles to retain entanglement in coin space</strong><br>
C.M. Chandrashekar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609113">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609113</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In most widely discussed discrete time quantum walk model, after every unitary shift operator, the particle evolves into the superposition of position space and settles down in one of its basis states, loosing entanglement in the coin space in the new position. The Hadamard operation is applied to let the particle to evolve into the superposition in the coin space and the walk is iterated. We present a model with a additional degree of freedom for the unitary shift operator $U^{\prime}$. The unitary operator with additional degree of freedom will evolve the quantum particle into superposition of position space retaining the entanglement in coin space. This eliminates the need for quantum coin toss (Hadamard operation) after every unitary displacement operation as used in most widely studied version of the discrete time quantum walk model. This construction is easily extended to a multiple particle quantum walk and in this article we extend it for a pair of particles in pure state entangled in coin degree of freedom by simultaneously subjecting it to a pair of unitary displacement operators which were constructed for single particle. We point out that unlike for single particle quantum walk, upon measurement of its position after $N$ steps, the entangled particles are found together with 1/2 probability and at different positions with 1/2 probability. This can act as an advantage in applications of the quantum walk. A special case is also treated using a complex physical system such as, inter species two-particle entangled Bose-Einstein condensate, as an example.

<blockquote>
<p>
Graph states are special kinds of multipartite entangled states that correspond to mathematical graphs where the vertices take the role of quantum spin systems and the edges represent interactions. They not only provide an efficient model to study multiparticle entanglement, but also find wide applications in quantum error correction, multi-party quantum communication and most prominently, serve as the central resource in one-way quantum computation. Here we report the creation of two special instances of graph states, the six-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states -- the largest photonic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat, and the six-photon cluster states-- a state-of-the-art one-way quantum computer. Flexibly, slight modifications of our method allow creation of many other graph states. Thus we have demonstrated the ability of entangling six photons and engineering multiqubit graph states, and created a test-bed for investigations of one-way quantum computation and studies of multiparticle entanglement as well as foundational issues such as nonlocality and decoherence.

We address the problem of estimating the phase phi given N copies of the phase rotation gate u(phi). We consider, for the first time, the optimization of the general case where the circuit consists of an arbitrary input state, followed by any arrangement of the N phase rotations interspersed with arbitrary quantum operations, and ending with a POVM. Using the polynomial method, we show that, in all cases where the measure of quality of the estimate phi&#39; for phi depends only on the difference phi&#39;-phi, the optimal scheme has a very simple fixed form. This implies that an optimal general phase estimation procedure can be found by just optimizing the amplitudes of the initial state.

<blockquote>
<p>
Since Grover&#39;s seminal work, quantum search has been studied in great detail. In the usual search problem, we have a collection of n items and we would like to find a marked item. We consider a new variant of this problem in which evaluating the i-th item may take a different number of time steps for different i. Let t_i be the number of time steps required to evaluate the i-th item. If the numbers t_i are known in advance, we give an algorithm that solves the problem in O(\sqrt{t_1^2+t_2^2+...+t_n^2}) steps. This is optimal, as we also show a matching lower bound. The case, when t_i are not known in advance, can be solved with a polylogarithmic overhead. We also give an application of our new search algorithm to computing read-once functions.

<p><strong>20.    Quantum speedup of classical mixing processes</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. A 76, 042306 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609204">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609204</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most approximation algorithms for #P-complete problems (e.g., evaluating the permanent of a matrix or the volume of a polytope) work by reduction to the problem of approximate sampling from a distribution $\pi$ over a large set $\S$. This problem is solved using the {\em Markov chain Monte Carlo} method: a sparse, reversible Markov chain $P$ on $\S$ with stationary distribution $\pi$ is run to near equilibrium. The running time of this random walk algorithm, the so-called {\em mixing time} of $P$, is $O(\delta^{-1} \log 1/\pi_<em>)$ as shown by Aldous, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$ and $\pi_</em>$ is the minimum value of $\pi$. A natural question is whether a speedup of this classical method to $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} \log 1/\pi_<em>)$, the diameter of the graph underlying $P$, is possible using {\em quantum walks}. We provide evidence for this possibility using quantum walks that {\em decohere} under repeated randomized measurements. We show: (a) decoherent quantum walks always mix, just like their classical counterparts, (b) the mixing time is a robust quantity, essentially invariant under any smooth form of decoherence, and (c) the mixing time of the decoherent quantum walk on a periodic lattice $\Z_n^d$ is $O(n d \log d)$, which is indeed $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} \log 1/\pi_</em>)$ and is asymptotically no worse than the diameter of $\Z_n^d$ (the obvious lower bound) up to at most a logarithmic factor.

<p><strong>21.    One-party Quantum Error Correcting Codes for Unbalanced Errors: Principles and Application to Quantum Dense Coding and Quantum Secure Direct Communications</strong><br>
Kai Wen, Gui Lu Long<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609207">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609207</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this article, we present the unbalanced quantum error correcting codes(one-party-QECC), a novel idea for correcting unbalanced quantum errors. In some quantum communication tasks using entangled pairs, the error distributions between two parts of the pairs are unbalanced, and. one party holds the whole entangled pairs at the final stage, and he or she is able to perform joint measurements on the pairs. In this situation the proposed one-party-QECC can improve error correction by allowing a higher tolerated error rate. We have established the general correspondence between linear classical codes and the one-party-QECC, and we have given the general definition for this type quantum error correcting codes.It has been shown that the one-party-QECC can correct errors as long as the error threshold is not larger than 0.5. The one-party-QECC works even for fidelity less than 0.5 as long as it is larger than 0.25. We give several concrete examples of the one-party-QECC. We provide the applications of one-party-QECC in quantum dense coding so that it can function in noisy channels. As a result, a large number of quantum secure direct communication protocols based on dense coding is also able to be protected by this new type of one-party-QECC.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609222">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609222</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we develop a numerical framework to investigate the renormalization of the non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system to which dynamical decoupling is applied. We utilize a non-Markovian master equation which is derived from the non-Markovian quantum trajectories formalism. It contains incoherent Markovian dynamics and coherent Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics as its limiting cases and is capable of capture the transition between them. We have performed comprehensive simulations for the cases in which the system is either driven by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise or or is described by the spin-boson model. The renormalized dynamics under bang-bang control and continuous dynamical decoupling are simulated. Our results indicate that the renormalization of the non-Markovian dynamics depends crucially on the spectral density of the environment and the envelop of the decoupling pulses. The framework developed in this work hence provides an unified approach to investigate the efficiency of realistic decoupling pulses. This work also opens a way to further optimize the decoupling via pulse shaping.

<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum walk, \emph{i.e.}, the quantum evolution of a particle on a graph, is termed \emph{scalar} if the internal space of the moving particle (often called the coin) has a dimension one. Here, we study the existence of scalar quantum walks on Cayley graphs, which are built from the generators of a group. After deriving a necessary condition on these generators for the existence of a scalar quantum walk, we present a general method to express the evolution operator of the walk, assuming homogeneity of the evolution. We use this necessary condition and the subsequent constructive method to investigate the existence of scalar quantum walks on Cayley graphs of various groups presented with two or three generators. In this restricted framework, we classify all groups -- in terms of relations between their generators -- that admit scalar quantum walks, and we also derive the form of the most general evolution operator. Finally, we point out some interesting special cases, and extend our study to a few examples of Cayley graphs built with more than three generators.

<p><strong>24.    Large Fourier transforms never exactly realized by braiding conformal blocks</strong><br>
Michael H. Freedman, Zhenghan Wang<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fourier transform is an essential ingredient in Shor&#39;s factoring algorithm. In the standard quantum circuit model with the gate set ${\U(2), \textrm{CNOT}}$, the discrete Fourier transforms $F_N=(\omega^{ij})<em>{N\times N},i,j=0,1,..., N-1, \omega=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}}$, can be realized exactly by quantum circuits of size $O(n^2), n=\textrm{log}N$, and so can the discrete sine/cosine transforms. In topological quantum computing, the simplest universal topological quantum computer is based on the Fibonacci (2+1)-topological quantum field theory (TQFT), where the standard quantum circuits are replaced by unitary transformations realized by braiding conformal blocks. We report here that the large Fourier transforms $F</em>N$ and the discrete sine/cosine transforms can never be realized exactly by braiding conformal blocks for a fixed TQFT. It follows that approximation is unavoidable to implement the Fourier transforms by braiding conformal blocks.
