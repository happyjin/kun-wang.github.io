    <p><strong>1.    Quantum Entanglement under Non-Markovian Dynamics of Two Qubits Interacting with a common Electromagnetic Field</strong><br>
C. Anastopoulos, S. Shresta, B. L. Hu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610007">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610007</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pair of qubits made of two-level atoms separated in space with distance r and interacting with one common electromagnetic field but not directly with each other. Our calculation makes a weak coupling assumption, but no Born or Markov approximation. We derived a non-Markovian master equation for the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the two-qubit system after integrating out the electromagnetic field modes. It contains a Markovian part with a Lindblad type operator and a nonMarkovian contribution, the physics of which is the main focus of this study. We use the concurrence function as a measure of quantum entanglement between the two qubits. Two classes of states are studied in detail: Class A is a one parameter family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and Class B states are linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell states. We obtain similar behavior for the Bell states as in earlier results derived by using the Born-Markov approximation. However, in the Class A states the behavior is qualitatively different: under the non-Markovian evolution we do not see sudden death of quantum entanglement and subsequent revivals, except when the qubits are sufficiently far apart. We provide explanations for such differences of behavior both between these two classes of states and between the predictions from the Markov and non-Markovian dynamics. We also study the decoherence of this two-qubit system and find that the decoherence rate in the case of one qubit initially in an excited state does not change significantly with the qubits separation whereas it does for the case when one qubit is initially in the ground state.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum Error Correction Beyond Completely Positive Maps</strong><br>
A. Shabani, D.A. Lidar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610028">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610028</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
By introducing an operator sum representation for arbitrary linear maps, we develop a generalized theory of quantum error correction (QEC) that applies to any linear map, in particular maps that are not completely positive (CP). This theory of &quot;linear quantum error correction&quot; is applicable in cases where the standard and restrictive assumption of a factorized initial system-bath state does not apply.

<p><strong>3.    Compatibility of subsystem states and convex geometry</strong><br>
William Hall<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610031">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610031</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The subsystem compatibility problem, which concerns the question of whether a set of subsystem states are compatible with a state of the entire system, has received much study. Here we attack the problem from a new angle, utilising the ideas of convexity that have been successfully employed against the separability problem. Analogously to an entanglement witness, we introduce the idea of a compatibility witness, and prove a number of properties about these objects. We show that the subsystem compatibility problem can be solved numerically and efficiently using semidefinite programming, and that the numerical results from this solution can be used to extract exact analytic results, an idea which we use to disprove a conjecture about the subsystem problem made by Butterley et al. [Found. Phys. 36 83 (2006)]. Finally, we consider how the ideas can be used to tackle some important variants of the compatibility problem; in particular, the case of identical particles (known as N-representability in the case of fermions) is considered.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610038">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610038</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correcting codes have been shown to have the ability of making quantum information resilient against noise. Here we show that we can use quantum error correcting codes as diagnostics to characterise noise. The experiment is based on a three-bit quantum error correcting code carried out on a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information processor. Utilizing both engineered and natural noise, the degree of correlations present in the noise affecting a two-qubit subsystem was determined. We measured a correlation factor of c=0.5+/-0.2 using the error correction protocol, and c=0.3+/-0.2 using a standard NMR technique based on coherence pathway selection. Although the error correction method demands precise control, the results demonstrate that the required precision is achievable in the liquid-state NMR setting.

<p><strong>5.    Subsystem fault tolerance with the Bacon-Shor code</strong><br>
Panos Aliferis, Andrew W. Cross<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007) 220502<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610063">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610063</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss how the presence of gauge sub-systems in the Bacon-Shor code [D. Bacon, Phys. Rev. A 73, 012340 (2006)] leads to remarkably simple and efficient methods for fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC). Most notably, FTEC does not require entangled ancillary states and it can be implemented with nearest-neighbor two-qubit measurements. By using these methods, we prove a lower bound on the quantum accuracy threshold, 1.94 \times 10^{-4} for adversarial stochastic noise, that improves previous lower bounds by nearly an order of magnitude.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610075">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610075</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A semi-spectral Chebyshev method for solving numerically singular integral equations is presented and applied in the quarkonium bound-state problem in momentum space. The integrals containing both, logarithmic and Cauchy singular kernels, can be evaluated without subtractions by dedicated automatic quadratures. By introducing a Chebyshev mesh and using the Nystrom algorithm the singular integral equation is converted into an algebraic eigenvalue problem that can be solved by standard methods. The proposed scheme is very simple to use, is easy in programming and highly accurate.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum Error Correcting Subsystem Codes From Two Classical Linear Codes</strong><br>
Dave Bacon, Andrea Casaccino<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610088">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610088</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The essential insight of quantum error correction was that quantum information can be protected by suitably encoding this quantum information across multiple independently erred quantum systems. Recently it was realized that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes. These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are generalizations of Shor&#39;s original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the number of stabilizer measurements needed in their error recovery routines.

<p><strong>8.    Correcting Quantum Errors with Entanglement</strong><br>
Todd Brun, Igor Devetak, Min-Hsiu Hsieh<br>
Science 314, 436-439 (2006).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610092">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610092</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how entanglement shared between encoder and decoder can simplify the theory of quantum error correction. The entanglement-assisted quantum codes we describe do not require the dual-containing constraint necessary for standard quantum error correcting codes, thus allowing us to ``quantize&#39;&#39; all of classical linear coding theory. In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity). For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement enables quantum communication.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610100">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610100</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Focus is on two parties with Hilbert spaces of dimension d, i.e. &quot;qudits&quot;. In the state space of these two possibly entangled qudits an analogue to the well known tetrahedron with the four qubit Bell states at the vertices is presented. The simplex analogue to this magic tetrahedron includes mixed states. Each of these states appears to each of the two parties as the maximally mixed state. Some studies on these states are performed, and special elements of this set are identified. A large number of them is included in the chosen simplex which fits exactly into conditions needed for teleportation and other applications. Its rich symmetry - related to that of a classical phase space - helps to study entanglement, to construct witnesses and perform partial transpositions. This simplex has been explored in details for d=3. In this paper the mathematical background and extensions to arbitrary dimensions are analysed.

<p><strong>11.    Evolving Quantum Oracles with Hybrid Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm</strong><br>
Shengchao Ding, Zhi Jin, Qing Yang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610105">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610105</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum oracles play key roles in the studies of quantum computation and quantum information. But implementing quantum oracles efficiently with universal quantum gates is a hard work. Motivated by genetic programming, this paper proposes a novel approach to evolve quantum oracles with a hybrid quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm. The approach codes quantum circuits with numerical values and combines the cost and correctness of quantum circuits into the fitness function. To speed up the calculation of matrix multiplication in the evaluation of individuals, a fast algorithm of matrix multiplication with Kronecker product is also presented. The experiments show the validity and the effects of some parameters of the presented approach. And some characteristics of the novel approach are discussed too.

<blockquote>
<p>
We design a controlled-phase gate for linear optical quantum computing by using photodetectors that cannot resolve photon number. An intrinsic error-correction circuit corrects errors introduced by the detectors. Our controlled-phase gate has a 1/4 success probability. Recent development in cluster-state quantum computing has shown that a two-qubit gate with non-zero success probability can build an arbitrarily large cluster state with only polynomial overhead. Hence, it is possible to generate optical cluster states without number-resolving detectors and with polynomial overhead.

<p><strong>13.    Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible?</strong><br>
M. I. Dyakonov<br>
In: Future Trends in Microelectronics. Up the Nano Creek, S. Luryi, J. Xu, and A. Zaslavsky (eds), Wiley (2007), pp. 4-18<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610117">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610117</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The so-called &quot;threshold&quot; theorem says that, once the error rate per qubit per gate is below a certain value, indefinitely long quantum computation becomes feasible, even if all of the qubits involved are subject to relaxation processes, and all the manipulations with qubits are not exact. The purpose of this article, intended for physicists, is to outline the ideas of quantum error correction and to take a look at the proposed technical instruction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. It seems that the mathematics behind the threshold theorem is somewhat detached from the physical reality, and that some ideal elements are always present in the construction. This raises serious doubts about the possibility of large scale quantum computations, even as a matter of principle.

<p><strong>14.    Building Gaussian Cluster States by Linear Optics</strong><br>
Peter van Loock, Christian Weedbrook, Mile Gu<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610119">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610119</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The linear optical creation of Gaussian cluster states, a potential resource for universal quantum computation, is investigated. We show that for any Gaussian cluster state, the canonical generation scheme in terms of QND-type interactions, can be entirely replaced by off-line squeezers and beam splitters. Moreover, we find that, in terms of squeezing resources, the canonical states are rather wasteful and we propose a systematic way to create cheaper states. As an application, we consider Gaussian cluster computation in multiple-rail encoding. This encoding may reduce errors due to finite squeezing, even when the extra rails are achieved through off-line squeezing and linear optics.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610130">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610130</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an implementation of Grover&#39;s algorithm in the framework of Feynman&#39;s cursor model of a quantum computer. The cursor degrees of freedom act as a quantum clocking mechanism, and allow Grover&#39;s algorithm to be performed using a single, time-independent Hamiltonian. We examine issues of locality and resource usage in implementing such a Hamiltonian. In the familiar language of Heisenberg spin-spin coupling, the clocking mechanism appears as an excitation of a basically linear chain of spins, with occasional controlled jumps that allow for motion on a planar graph: in this sense our model implements the idea of &quot;timing&quot; a quantum algorithm using a continuous-time random walk. In this context we examine some consequences of the entanglement between the states of the input/output register and the states of the quantum clock.

<blockquote>
<p>
Human languages employ constructions that tacitly assume specific properties of the limited range of phenomena they evolved to describe. These assumed properties are true features of that limited context, but may not be general or precise properties of all the physical situations allowed by fundamental physics. In brief, human languages contain <code>excess baggage&#39; that must be qualified, discarded, or otherwise reformed to give a clear account in the context of fundamental physics of even the everyday phenomena that the languages evolved to describe. The surest route to clarity is to express the constructions of human languages in the language of fundamental physical theory, not the other way around. These ideas are illustrated by an analysis of the verb</code>to happen&#39; and the word `reality&#39; in special relativity and the modern quantum mechanics of closed systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
Classes of (p,q)-deformations of the Jaynes-Cummings model in the rotating wave approximation are considered. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is performed exactly, leading to useful spectral decompositions of a series of relevant operators. The latter include ladder operators acting between adjacent energy eigenstates within two separate infinite discrete towers, except for a singleton state. These ladder operators allow for the construction of (p,q)-deformed vector coherent states. Using (p,q)-arithmetics, explicit and exact solutions to the associated moment problem are displayed, providing new classes of coherent states for such models. Finally, in the limit of decoupled spin sectors, our analysis translates into (p,q)-deformations of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator, such that the two supersymmetric sectors get intertwined through the action of the ladder operators as well as in the associated coherent states.

We study the quantum-mechanical transport on two-dimensional graphs by means of continuous-time quantum walks and analyse the effect of different boundary conditions (BCs). For periodic BCs in both directions, i.e., for tori, the problem can be treated in a large measure analytically. Some of these results carry over to graphs which obey open boundary conditions (OBCs), such as cylinders or rectangles. Under OBCs the long time transition probabilities (LPs) also display asymmetries for certain graphs, as a function of their particular sizes. Interestingly, these effects do not show up in the marginal distributions, obtained by summing the LPs along one direction.

<p><strong>23.    BQP-complete Problems Concerning Mixing Properties of Classical Random Walks on Sparse Graphs</strong><br>
Dominik Janzing, Pawel Wocjan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610235">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610235</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe two BQP-complete problems concerning properties of sparse graphs having a certain symmetry. The graphs are specified by efficiently computable functions which output the adjacent vertices for each vertex. Let i and j be two given vertices. The first problem consists in estimating the difference between the number of paths of length m from j to j and those which from i to j, where m is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. The scale of the estimation accuracy is specified by some a priori known upper bound on the growth of these differences with increasing m. The problem remains BQP-hard for regular graphs with degree 4. The second problem is related to continuous-time classical random walks. The walk starts at some vertex j. The promise is that the difference of the probabilities of being at j and at i, respectively, decays with O(exp(-\mu t)) for some \mu&gt;0. The problem is to decide whether this difference is greater than a exp(-\mu T) or smaller than b exp(-\mu T) after some time instant T, where T is polylogarithmic and the difference a-b is inverse polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. Since the probabilities differ only by an exponentially small amount, an exponential number of trials would be necessary if one tried to answer this question by running the walk itself. A modification of this problem, asking whether there exists a pair of nodes for which the probability difference is at least a exp(-\mu T), is QCMA-complete.

<p>
Quantum versions of random walks on the line and the cycle show a quadratic improvement over classical random walks in their spreading rates and mixing times respectively. Non-unitary quantum walks can provide a useful optimisation of these properties, producing a more uniform distribution on the line, and faster mixing times on the cycle. We investigate the interplay between quantum and random dynamics by comparing the resources required, and examining numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk. We show numerically that the optimal non-unitary quantum walk proceeds such that the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final measurement. This requires only O(log T) random bits for a quantum walk of T steps

This is the first one of a series of our papers theoretically studying the coherent control of photon transmission along the coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW) by doping artificial atoms for various hybrid structures. We will provide the several approaches correspondingly based on Green function, the mean field method and spin wave theory et al. In the present paper we adopt the two-time Green function approach to study the coherent transmission photon in a CROW with homogeneous couplings, each cavity of which is doped by a two-level artificial atom. We calculate the two-time correlation function for photon in the weak-coupling case. Its poles predict the exact dispersion relation, which results in the group velocity coherently controlled by the collective excitation of the doping atoms. We emphasize the role of the population inversion of doping atoms induced by some polarization mechanism.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this work, we propose two optical setups for two-players, non-zero and zero sum, quantum games in optical networks using light polarization of single-photon pulses, single-photon detectors and linear optical devices. The optical setups proposed can be easily implemented permitting a fast experimental realization of quantum games with present technology.

<p><strong>27.    Coherent dynamics on hierarchical systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the coherent transport modeled by continuous-time quantum walks, focussing on hierarchical structures. For these we use Husimi cacti, lattices dual to the dendrimers. We find that the transport depends strongly on the initial site of the excitation. For systems of sizes $N\le21$, we find that processes which start at central sites are nearly recurrent. Furthermore, we compare the classical limiting probability distribution to the long time average of the quantum mechanical transition probability which shows characteristic patterns. We succeed in finding a good lower bound for the (space) average of the quantum mechanical probability to be still or again at the initial site.
