    <p><strong>1.    Quantum walk on distinguishable non-interacting many-particles and indistinguishable two-particle</strong><br>
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch<br>
Quantum Information Processing: Volume 11, Issue 5, Page 1287-1299 (2012)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We present an investigation of many-particle quantum walks in systems of non-interacting distinguishable particles. Along with a redistribution of the many-particle density profile we show that the collective evolution of the many-particle system resembles the single-particle quantum walk evolution when the number of steps is greater than the number of particles in the system. For non-uniform initial states we show that the quantum walks can be effectively used to separate the basis states of the particle in position space and grouping like state together. We also discuss a two-particle quantum walk on a two- dimensional lattice and demonstrate an evolution leading to the localization of both particles at the center of the lattice. Finally we discuss the outcome of a quantum walk of two indistinguishable particles interacting at some point during the evolution.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum Walks of SU(2)_k Anyons on a Ladder</strong><br>
L. Lehman, D. Ellinas, G.K. Brennen<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the effects of braiding interactions on single anyon dynamics using a quantum walk model on a quasi-1-dimensional ladder filled with stationary anyons. The model includes loss of information of the coin and nonlocal fusion degrees of freedom on every second time step, such that the entanglement between the position states and the exponentially growing auxiliary degrees of freedom is lost. The computational complexity of numerical calculations reduces drastically from the fully coherent anyonic quantum walk model, allowing for relatively long simulations for anyons which are spin-1/2 irreps of SU(2)_k Chern-Simons theory. We find that for Abelian anyons, the walk retains the ballistic spreading velocity just like particles with trivial braiding statistics. For non-Abelian anyons, the numerical results indicate that the spreading velocity is linearly dependent on the number of time steps. By approximating the Kraus generators of the time evolution map by circulant matrices, it is shown that the spatial probability distribution for the k=2 walk, corresponding to Ising model anyons, is equal to the classical unbiased random walk distribution.

<p><strong>3.    Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion for an open quantum system in fermionic environments</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) provides a powerful approach to the dynamics of an open quantum system in bosonic environments. Here we develop an NMQSD method to study the open quantum system in fermionic environments. This problem involves anticommutative noise functions (i.e., Grassmann variables) that are intrinsically different from the noise functions of bosonic baths. We obtain the NMQSD equation for quantum states of the system and the non-Markovian master equation. Moreover, we apply this NMQSD method to single and double quantum-dot systems.

<p>
In this paper we present an exact Grassmann stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation for the dynamics of an open fermionic quantum system coupled to a reservoir consisting of a finite or infinite number of fermions. We use this stochastic approach to derive the exact master equation for a fermionic system strongly coupled to electronic reservoirs. The generality and applicability of this Grassmann stochastic approach is justified and exemplified by several quantum open system problems concerning quantum decoherence and quantum transport for both vacuum and finite-temperature fermionic reservoirs. We show that the quantum coherence property of the quantum dot system can be profoundly modified by the environment memory.

<blockquote>
<p>
The problem of recognizing (non-)Markovianity of a quantum dynamics is revisited through analyzing quantum correlations. We argue that instantaneously-vanishing quantum discord provides a necessary and sufficient condition for Markovianity of a quantum map. This is used to introduce a measure of non-Markovianity. This measure, however, requires demanding knowledge about the system and the environment. By using a quantum correlation monogamy property and an ancillary system, we propose a simplified measure with less requirements. Non-Markovianity is thereby decided by quantum state tomography of the system and the ancilla.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum annealing with antiferromagnetic fluctuations</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2418">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2418</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuations into quantum annealing in addition to the conventional transverse-field term. We apply this method to the infinite-range ferromagnetic p-spin model, for which the conventional quantum annealing has been shown to have difficulties to find the ground state efficiently due to a first-order transition. We study the phase diagram of this system both analytically and numerically. Using the static approximation, we find that there exists a quantum path to reach the final ground state from the trivial initial state that avoids first-order transitions for intermediate values of p. We also study numerically the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state and find evidence for intermediate values of p that the time complexity scales polynomially with the system size at a second-order transition point along the quantum path that avoids first-order transitions. These results suggest that quantum annealing would be able to solve this problem with intermediate values of p efficiently in contrast to the case with only simple transverse-field fluctuations.

Phase diffusion represents a crucial obstacle towards the implementation of high precision interferometric measurements and phase shift based communication channels. Here we present a nearly optimal interferometric scheme based on homodyne detection and coherent signals for the detection of a phase shift in the presence of large phase diffusion. In our scheme the ultimate bound to interferometric sensitivity is achieved already for a small number of measurements, of the order of hundreds, without using nonclassical light.

We analyse the role played by system-environment correlations in the emergence of non-Markovian dynamics. By working within the framework developed in Breuer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009), we unveil a fundamental connection between non-Markovian behaviour and dynamics of system-environment correlations. We derive an upper bound to the rate of change of the distinguishability between different states of the system that explicitly depends on the development and establishment of correlations between system and environment. We illustrate our results using a fully solvable spin-chain model, which allows us to gain insight on the mechanisms triggering non-Markovian evolution.

<p><strong>9.    A paradox in bosonic energy computations via semidefinite programming relaxations</strong><br>
M. Navascues, A. Garcia-Saez, A. Acin, S. Pironio, M. B. Plenio<br>
New J. Phys. 15, 023026 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3777">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3777</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the recent hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on non-commutative polynomial optimization and reduced density matrix variational methods exhibits an interesting paradox when applied to the bosonic case: even though it can be rigorously proven that the hierarchy collapses after the first step, numerical implementations of higher order steps generate a sequence of improving lower bounds that converges to the optimal solution. We analyze this effect and compare it with similar behavior observed in implementations of semidefinite programming relaxations for commutative polynomial minimization. We conclude that the method converges due to the rounding errors occurring during the execution of the numerical program, and show that convergence is lost as soon as computer precision is incremented. We support this conclusion by proving that for any element p of a Weyl algebra which is non-negative in the Schrodinger representation there exists another element p&#39; arbitrarily close to p that admits a sum of squares decomposition.

<p>
The spatial search problem on regular lattice structures in integer number of dimensions $d\geq2$ has been studied extensively, using both coined and coinless quantum walks. The relativistic Dirac operator has been a crucial ingredient in these studies. Here we investigate the spatial search problem on fractals of non-integer dimensions. Although the Dirac operator cannot be defined on a fractal, we construct the quantum walk on a fractal using the flip-flop operator that incorporates a Klein-Gordon mode. We find that the scaling behavior of the spatial search is determined by the spectral (and not the fractal) dimension. Our numerical results have been obtained on the well-known Sierpinski gaskets in two and three dimensions.

<p><strong>11.    Markovian Classicality from Zero Discord for Bipartite Quantum Systems</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4612">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4612</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern quantum information theory provides new tools for investigating the decoherence-induced &quot;classicality&quot; of open quantum systems. Recent observation that almost all quantum states bear non-classical correlations [A. Ferraro {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 81}, 052318 (2010)] distinguishes the zero-discord classicality essentially as a pathology of the Markovian bipartite-systems realm. Nevertheless, we formally construct such a classical model and its variant that represents a matter-of-principle formal proof, i.e. a sufficient condition for the, otherwise not obvious, existence of the Markovian zero-discord classicality. A need for the more elaborate and more systematic search for the alternative such models reveals we are still learning about the very meaning of &quot;classicality&quot; in the realm of open quantum systems.

<p><strong>12.    Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Paul Christiano<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a &quot;classical&quot; hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the &quot;black-box&quot; version of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in Wiesner&#39;s original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner&#39;s scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis&#39;s quantum adversary method, and several other tools that might be of independent interest.

<p>
A post-Markovian master equation has been recently proposed as a tool to describe the evolution of a system coupled to a memory-keeping environment [A. Shabani and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101 (R) (2005)]. For a single qubit affected by appropriately chosen environmental conditions, the corresponding dynamics is always legitimate and physical. Here we extend such situation to the case of two qubits, only one of which experiences the environmental effects. We show how, despite the innocence of such an extension, the introduction of the second qubit should be done cum grano salis to avoid consequences such as the breaking of the positivity of the associated dynamical map. This hints at the necessity of using care when adopting phenomenologically derived models for evolutions occurring outside the Markovian framework.

We demonstrate that the Renyi-2 entropy provides a natural measure of information for any multimode Gaussian state of quantum harmonic systems, operationally linked to the phase-space Shannon sampling entropy of the Wigner distribution of the state. We prove that, in the Gaussian scenario, such an entropy satisfies the strong subadditivity inequality, a key requirement for quantum information theory. This allows us to define and analyze measures of Gaussian entanglement and more general quantum correlations based on such an entropy, which are shown to satisfy relevant properties such as monogamy.

<p><strong>15.    A quantum walk with a delocalized initial state: contribution from a coin-flip operator</strong><br>
Takuya Machida<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5396">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5396</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A unit evolution step of discrete-time quantum walks is determined by both a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. The behavior of quantum walkers after many steps delicately depends on the coin-flip operator and an initial condition of the walk. To get the behavior, a lot of long-time limit distributions for the quantum walks starting with a localized initial state have been derived. In the present paper, we compute limit distributions of a 2-state quantum walk with a delocalized initial state, not a localized initial state, and discuss how the walker depends on the coin-flip operator. The initial state induced from the Fourier series expansion, which is called the $(\alpha,\beta)$ delocalized initial state in this paper, provides different limit density functions from the ones of the quantum walk with a localized initial state.

<p><strong>16.    Non-Markovian Decoherent Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Peng Xue, Yongsheng Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5630">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5630</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walk acts obviously different from its classical counterpart, but decoherence will lessen and close the gap between them. To understand this process, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under different situation of decoherence. In this article, we study a non-Markovian decoherent quantum walk on a line. In the short time regime, the behavior of the walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks. The position variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the first several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive spread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing affecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin. We also study both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of quantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time regime and tend to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore quantum walk with non-Markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long time limit, while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic and diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and revivals due to the memory effect.

We show how multi-walker quantum walks can be implemented in a quantum quincunx created via cavity quantum electrodynamics. The implementation of a quantum walk with a multi-walker opens up the interesting possibility to introduce entanglement and more advanced walks. With different coin tosses and initial states the multi-walker quantum walk shows different probability distributions which deviate strongly from the classical random walks with quadratic enhanced spreadings and localization effects. By introducing decoherence, the transition from quantum walks to the classical versions is observed. We introduce the average fidelity decay as a signature to investigate the decoherence-induced irreversibility of quantum walks.

<blockquote>
<p>
An efficient optimal-control theory based on the Krotov method is introduced for a non-Markovian open quantum system with a time-nonlocal master equation in which the control parameter and the bath correlation function are correlated. This optimal-control method is developed via a quantum dissipation formulation that transforms the time-nonlocal master equation to a set of coupled linear time-local equations of motion in an extended auxiliary Liouville space. As an illustration, the optimal-control method is applied to find the control sequences for high-fidelity Z gates and identity gates of a qubit embedded in a non-Markovian bath. Z gates and identity gates with errors less than 10^{-5} for a wide range of bath decoherence parameters can be achieved for the non-Markovian open qubit system with control over only the {\sigma}z term. The control-dissipation correlation and the memory effect of the bath are crucial in achieving the high-fidelity gates.

<p>
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to be versatile candidates to study the fundamentals of light-matter interaction [1-3]. In contrast with atom optics, dissipative processes are induced by the inherent coupling to the environment and are typically perceived as a major obstacle towards stable performances in experiments and applications [4]. In this paper we show that this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the memory of the environment can enhance coherent quantum optical effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Markovian coupling to an incoherent phonon bath has a stabilizing effect on the coherent QD cavity-quantum electrodynamics (cQED) by inhibiting irregular oscillations and boosting regular collapse and revival patterns. For low photon numbers we predict QD dynamics that deviate dramatically from the well-known atomic Jaynes-Cummings model. Our proposal opens the way to a systematic and deliberate design of photon quantum effects via specifically engineered solid-state environments.

A central question of dynamics, largely open in the quantum case, is to what extent it erases a system&#39;s memory of its initial properties. Here we present a simple statistically solvable quantum model describing this memory loss across an integrability-chaos transition under a perturbation obeying no selection rules. From the perspective of quantum localization-delocalization on the lattice of quantum numbers, we are dealing with a situation where every lattice site is coupled to every other site with the same strength, on average. The model also rigorously justifies a similar set of relationships recently proposed in the context of two short-range-interacting ultracold atoms in a harmonic waveguide. Application of our model to an ensemble of uncorrelated impurities on a rectangular lattice gives good agreement with ab initio numerics.

The proplem of sound propagation in an oceanic waveguide is considered. Scattering on random inhomogeneity of the waveguide leads to wave chaos. Chaos reveals itself in spectral properties of the finite-range evolution operator (FREO). FREO describes transformation of a wavefield in course of propagation along a finite segment of a waveguide. We study transition to chaos by tracking variations in spectral statistics with increasing length of the segment. Analysis of the FREO is accompanied with ray calculations using the one-step Poincar\&#39;e map which is the classical counterpart of the FREO. Underwater sound channel in the Sea of Japan is taken for an example. Several methods of spectral analysis are utilized. In particular, we approximate level spacing statistics by means of the Berry-Robnik and Brody distributions, explore the spectrum using the procedure elaborated by A. Relano with coworkers (Relano et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2002; Relano, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008), and analyze modal expansions of the eigenfunctions. We show that the analysis of FREO eigenfunctions is more informative than the analysis of eigenvalue statistics. It is found that near-axial sound propagation in the Sea of Japan preserves stability even over distances of hundreds kilometers. This phenomenon is associated with the presence of a shearless torus in the classical phase space. Increasing of acoustic wavelength degrades scattering, resulting in recovery of localization near periodic orbits of the one-step Poincar\&#39;e map. Relying upon the formal analogy between wave and quantum chaos, we suggest that the concept of FREO, supported by classical calculations via the one-step Poincar\&#39;e map, can be efficiently applied for studying chaos-induced decoherence in quantum systems.

<p><strong>26.    Levinson&#39;s theorem for graphs II</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset<br>
Journal of Mathematical Physics 53, 102207 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6557">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6557</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove Levinson&#39;s theorem for scattering on an (m+n)-vertex graph with n semi-infinite paths each attached to a different vertex, generalizing a previous result for the case n=1. This theorem counts the number of bound states in terms of the winding of the determinant of the S-matrix. We also provide a proof that the bound states and incoming scattering states of the Hamiltonian together form a complete basis for the Hilbert space, generalizing another result for the case n=1.

<p><strong>27.    Low-noise on-chip frequency conversion by four-wave-mixing Bragg scattering in SiNx waveguides</strong><br>
Imad Agha, Marcelo Davanco, Bryce Thurston, Kartik Srinivasan<br>
Optics Letters 37, 2997-2999 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6558">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6558</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Low-noise, tunable wavelength-conversion through non-degenerate four-wave mixing Bragg scattering in SiNx waveguides is experimentally demonstrated. Finite element method simulations of waveguide dispersion are used with the split-step Fourier method to predict device performance, and indicate a strong dependence of the conversion efficiency on phase matching, which is controlled by the waveguide geometry. Two 1550 nm wavelength band pulsed pumps are used to achieve tunable conversion of a 980 nm signal over a range of 5 nm with a peak conversion efficiency of \approx 5 %. The demonstrated Bragg scattering process is suitable for frequency conversion of quantum states of light.
