    <p><strong>1.    Completely-Positive Non-Markovian Decoherence</strong><br>
Jinhyoung Lee, Inbo Kim, Helen McAneney, M. S. Kim, Doyeol Ahn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 024301 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403018">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403018</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an effective Hamiltonian approach to investigate decoherence of a quantum system in a non-Markovian reservoir, naturally imposing the complete positivity on the reduced dynamics of the system. The formalism is based on the notion of an effective reservoir, i.e., certain collective degrees of freedom in the reservoir that are responsible for the decoherence. As examples for completely positive decoherence, we present three typical decoherence processes for a qubit such as dephasing, depolarizing, and amplitude-damping. The effects of the non-Markovian decoherence are compared to the Markovian decoherence.

<p><strong>2.    On the distributed compression of quantum information</strong><br>
Charlene Ahn, Andrew Doherty, Patrick Hayden, Andreas Winter<br>
IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 52(10):4349-4357, 2006.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403042">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403042</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of distributed compression for correlated quantum sources. The classical version of this problem was solved by Slepian and Wolf, who showed that distributed compression could take full advantage of redundancy in the local sources created by the presence of correlations. We show that, in general, this is not the case for quantum sources by proving a lower bound on the rate sum for irreducible sources of product states which is stronger than the one given by a naive application of Slepian-Wolf. Nonetheless, strategies taking advantage of correlation do exist for some special classes of quantum sources. For example, Devetak and Winter demonstrated the existence of such a strategy when one of the sources is classical. Here we find optimal non-trivial strategies for a different extreme, sources of Bell states. In addition, we illustrate how distributed compression is connected to other problems in quantum information theory, including information-disturbance questions, entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.

<p><strong>3.    Scalable quantum computation in systems with Bose-Hubbard dynamics</strong><br>
Guido Pupillo, Ana Maria Rey, Gavin Brennen, Carl J. Williams, Charles W. Clark<br>
Journal of Modern Optics 51, 2395 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403052">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403052</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Several proposals for quantum computation utilize a lattice type architecture with qubits trapped by a periodic potential. For systems undergoing many body interactions described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, the ground state of the system carries number fluctuations that scale with the number of qubits. This process degrades the initialization of the quantum computer register and can introduce errors during error correction. In an earlier manuscript we proposed a solution to this problem tailored to the loading of cold atoms into an optical lattice via the Mott Insulator phase transition. It was shown that by adding an inhomogeneity to the lattice and performing a continuous measurement, the unit filled state suitable for a quantum computer register can be maintained. Here, we give a more rigorous derivation of the register fidelity in homogeneous and inhomogeneous lattices and provide evidence that the protocol is effective in the finite temperature regime.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum Identification of Boolean Oracles</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Kazuo Iwama, Akinori Kawachi, Hiroyuki Masuda, Raymond H. Putra, Shigeru Yamashita<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403056">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403056</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The oracle identification problem (OIP) is, given a set $S$ of $M$ Boolean oracles out of $2^{N}$ ones, to determine which oracle in $S$ is the current black-box oracle. We can exploit the information that candidates of the current oracle is restricted to $S$. The OIP contains several concrete problems such as the original Grover search and the Bernstein-Vazirani problem. Our interest is in the quantum query complexity, for which we present several upper and lower bounds. They are quite general and mostly optimal: (i) The query complexity of OIP is $O(\sqrt{N\log M \log N}\log\log M)$ for {\it any} $S$ such that $M = |S| &gt; N$, which is better than the obvious bound $N$ if $M &lt; 2^{N/\log^{3}N}$. (ii) It is $O(\sqrt{N})$ for {\it any} $S$ if $|S| = N$, which includes the upper bound for the Grover search as a special case. (iii) For a wide range of oracles ($|S| = N$) such as random oracles and balanced oracles, the query complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{N/K})$, where $K$ is a simple parameter determined by $S$.

<p><strong>6.    Demonstration of an all-optical quantum controlled-NOT gate</strong><br>
J L O&#39;Brien, G J Pryde, A G White, T C Ralph, D Branning<br>
Nature.426:264,2003<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403062">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403062</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The promise of tremendous computational power, coupled with the development of robust error-correcting schemes, has fuelled extensive efforts to build a quantum computer. The requirements for realizing such a device are confounding: scalable quantum bits (two-level quantum systems, or qubits) that can be well isolated from the environment, but also initialized, measured and made to undergo controllable interactions to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates. The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of only the input qubits&#39; logical values, for a single operating condition of the gate. The gate is probabilistic (the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but with the addition of linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is equivalent to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum computation.

<p><strong>7.    On the Optimal Mean Photon Number for Quantum Cryptography</strong><br>
David Pearson, Chip Elliott<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403065">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403065</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The optimal mean photon number (mu) for quantum cryptography is the average photon number per transmitted pulse that results in the highest delivery rate of distilled cryptographic key bits, given a specific system scenario and set of assumptions about Eve&#39;s capabilities. Although many experimental systems have employed a mean photon number (mu) of 0.1 in practice, several research teams have pointed out that this value is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, various optimal values for mu have been described in the literature. In this paper we offer a detailed analytic model for an experimental, fiber-based quantum cryptographic system, and an explicit set of reasonable assumptions about Eve&#39;s current technical capabilities. We explicitly model total system behavior ranging from physical effects to the results of quantum cryptographic protocols such as error correction and privacy amplification. We then derive the optimal photon number (mu) for this system in a range of scenarios. One interesting result is that mu of approximately 1.1 is optimal for a wide range of realistic, fiber-based QKD systems; in fact, it provides nearly 10 times the distilled throughput of systems that employ a more conventional mu = 0.1, without any adverse affect on system security, as judged against a set of reasonable assumptions about Eve&#39;s current capabilities.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum walks on graphs and quantum scattering theory</strong><br>
Edgar Feldman, Mark Hillery<br>
Coding Theory and Quantum Computing, edited by D. Evans, J. Holt, C. Jones, K. Klintworth, B. Parshall, O. Pfister, and H. Ward, Contemporary Mathematics, 381, 71 (2005).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403066">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403066</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss a particular kind of quantum walk on a general graph. We affix two semi-infinite lines to a general finite graph, which we call tails. On the tails, the particle making the walk simply advances one unit at each time step, so that its behavior there is analogous to free propagation We are interested in how many steps it will take the particle, starting on one tail and propagating through the graph (where its propagation is not free), to emerge onto the other tail. The probability to make such a walk in n steps and the hitting time for such a walk can be expressed in terms of the transmission amplitude for the graph, which is one element of its S matrix. Demonstrating this necessitates a study of the analyticity properties of the transmission and reflection amplitudes of a graph. We show that the graph can have bound states that cannot be accessed by a particle entering the graph from one of its tails. Time-reversal invariance of a quantum walk is defined and used to show that the transmission amplitudes for the particle entering the graph from different directions are the same if the walk is time-reversal invariant.

<p><strong>11.    Graph-based simulation of quantum computation in the density matrix representation</strong><br>
George F. Viamontes, Igor L. Markov, John P. Hayes<br>
Quantum Information &amp; Computation, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 113-130 (2005).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403114">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403114</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum-mechanical phenomena are playing an increasing role in information processing, as transistor sizes approach the nanometer level, and quantum circuits and data encoding methods appear in the securest forms of communication. Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult because of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major complication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between the quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum circuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is potentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the computational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time and memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the number of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that explicitly store the density matrix intractable. In this work, we propose a new technique aimed at efficiently simulating quantum circuits that are subject to errors. In particular, we describe new graph-based algorithms implemented in the simulator QuIDDPro/D. While previously reported graph-based simulators operate in terms of the state-vector representation, these new algorithms use the density matrix representation. To gauge the improvements offered by QuIDDPro/D, we compare its simulation performance with an optimized array-based simulator called QCSim. Empirical results, generated by both simulators on a set of quantum circuit benchmarks involving error correction, reversible logic, communication, and quantum search, show that the graph-based approach far outperforms the array-based approach.

<p><strong>12.    Genuine quantum trajectories for non-Markovian processes</strong><br>
Heinz-Peter Breuer<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 012106 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403117">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403117</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A large class of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems can be formulated through time-local master equations which are not in Lindblad form. It is shown that such processes can be embedded in a Markovian dynamics which involves a time dependent Lindblad generator on an extended state space. If the state space of the open system is given by some Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}$, the extended state space is the triple Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}\otimes{\mathbb C}^3$ which is obtained by combining the open system with a three state system. This embedding is used to derive an unraveling for non-Markovian time evolution by means of a stochastic process in the extended state space. The process is defined through a stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger equation which generates genuine quantum trajectories for the state vector conditioned on a continuous monitoring of an environment. The construction leads to a continuous measurement interpretation for non-Markovian dynamics within the framework of the theory of quantum measurement.

<p><strong>15.    Quantum Algorithms and Covering Spaces</strong><br>
Tobias J. Osborne, Simone Severini<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403127">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403127</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we isolate the combinatorial property responsible (at least in part) for the computational speedups recently observed in some quantum walk algorithms. We find that continuous-time quantum walks can exploit the covering space property of certain graphs. We demonstrate that a quantum walk on a graph Y which covers a smaller graph X can be equivalent to a quantum walk on the smaller graph X. This equivalence occurs only when the walk begins on certain initial states, fibre-constant states, which respect the graph covering space structure. We illustrate these observations with walks on Cayley graphs; we show that walks on fibre-constant initial states for Cayley graphs are equivalent to walks on the induced Schreier graph. We also consider the problem of constructing efficient gate sequences simulating the time evolution of a continuous-time quantum walk. For the case of the walk on the m-torus graph T^m on 2^n vertices we construct a gate sequence which uses O(\poly(n)) gates which is independent of the time t the walk is simulated for (and so the sequence can simulate the walk for exponential times). We argue that there exists a wide class of nontrivial operators based on quantum walks on graphs which can be measured efficiently. We introduce a new general class of computational problems, HiddenCover, which includes a variant of the general hidden subgroup problem as a subclass. We argue that quantum computers ought to be able to utilise covering space structures to efficiently solve HiddenCover problems.

We study effects of static inter-qubit interactions on the stability of the Grover quantum search algorithm.

In the regular phase $(\epsilon &lt; \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm remains robust against imperfections showing the efficiency gain $\epsilon_c / \epsilon$ for $\epsilon \gtrsim 2^{-n_q/2}$. In the chaotic phase $(\epsilon &gt; \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm is completely destroyed.

In contrast, we find one-dimensional quantum walk with multi-state in which a particle stays at the starting point entirely with high positive probability.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the quantum walk on the line when decoherences are introduced either through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle position, or as a result of broken links. Both mechanisms drive the system to a classical diffusive behavior. In the case of measurements, we show that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the variance of the initially localized quantum random walker just before the first measurement. When links between neighboring sites are randomly broken with probability $p$ per unit time, the evolution becomes decoherent after a characteristic time that scales as $1/p$. The fact that the quadratic increase of the variance is eventually lost even for very small frequencies of disrupting events, suggests that the implementation of a quantum walk on a real physical system may be severely limited by thermal noise and lattice imperfections.

Quantum chaos is linked to Brownian diffusion of the underlying quantum energy level-spacing sequences. The level-spacings viewed as functions of their order execute random walks which imply uncorrelated random increments of the level-spacings while the integrability to chaos transition becomes a change from Poisson to Gauss statistics for the level-spacing increments. This universal nature of quantum chaotic spectral correlations is numerically demonstrated for eigenvalues from random tight binding lattices and for zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
