    <p><strong>1.    Faster quantum walk algorithm for the two dimensional spatial search</strong><br>
Avatar Tulsi<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of finding a desired item out of $N$ items arranged on the sites of a two-dimensional lattice of size $\sqrt{N} \times \sqrt{N}$. The previous quantum walk based algorithms take $O(\sqrt{N}\log N)$ steps to solve this problem, and it is an open question whether the performance can be improved. We present a new algorithm which solves the problem in $O(\sqrt{N\log N})$ steps, thus giving an $O(\sqrt{\log N})$ improvement over the known algorithms. The improvement is achieved by controlling the quantum walk on the lattice using an ancilla qubit.

<p><strong>2.    Unified Quantum Convolutional Coding</strong><br>
Mark M. Wilde, Todd A. Brun<br>
Proceedings of the 2008 International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 359-363, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, July 2008.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We outline a quantum convolutional coding technique for protecting a stream of classical bits and qubits. Our goal is to provide a framework for designing codes that approach the <code>grandfather&#39;&#39; capacity of an entanglement-assisted quantum channel for sending classical and quantum information simultaneously. Our method incorporates several resources for quantum redundancy: fresh ancilla qubits, entangled bits, and gauge qubits. The use of these diverse resources gives our technique the benefits of both active and passive quantum error correction. We can encode a classical-quantum bit stream with periodic quantum gates because our codes possess a convolutional structure. We end with an example of a</code>grandfather&#39;&#39; quantum convolutional code that protects one qubit and one classical bit per frame by encoding them with one fresh ancilla qubit, one entangled bit, and one gauge qubit per frame. We explicitly provide the encoding and decoding circuits for this example.

<p><strong>3.    A scheme for tunable quantum phase gate and effective preparation of graph-state entanglement</strong><br>
Gong-Wei Lin, Xu-Bo Zou, Ming-Yong Ye, Xiu-Min Lin, Guang-Can Guo<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme is presented for realizing a quantum phase gate with three-level atoms, solid-state qubits--often called artificial atoms, or ions that share a quantum data bus such as a single mode field in cavity QED system or a collective vibrational state of trapped ions. In this scheme, the conditional phase shift is tunable and controllable via the total effective interaction time. Furthermore, we show that the method can be used for effective preparation of graph-state entanglement, which are important resources for quantum computation, quantum error correction, studies of multiparticle entanglement, fundamental tests of non-locality and decoherence.

<p><strong>5.    On the iterative decoding of sparse quantum codes</strong><br>
David Poulin, Yeojin Chung<br>
QIC Vol.8 No.10 p.987 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1241">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1241</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the problem of decoding sparse quantum error correction codes. For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems. While our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods, they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding.

<p><strong>6.    Noise effect on Grover algorithm</strong><br>
Pedro J. Salas<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1261">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1261</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The decoherence effect on Grover algorithm has been studied numerically through a noise modelled by a depolarizing channel. Two types of error are introduced characterizing the qubit time evolution and gate application, so the noise is directly related to the quantum network construction. The numerical simulation concludes an exponential damping law for the successive probability of the maxima as time increases. We have obtained an allowed-error law for the algorithm: the error threshold for the allowed noise behaves as Eth(N) ~ 1/N1.1 (N being the size of the data set). As the power of N is almost one, we consider the Grover algorithm as robust to a certain extent against decoherence. This law also provides an absolute threshold: if the free evolution error is greater than 0.043, Grover algorithm does not work for any number of qubits affected by the present error model. The improvement in the probability of success, in the case of two qubits has been illustrated by using a fault-tolerant encoding of the initial state by means of the [[7,1,3]] quantum code.

<p><strong>7.    On the non-existence for quantum LDPC codes of type IEEE802.16e with rates 1/2 and 2/3B</strong><br>
Manabu Hagiwara, Hideki Imai<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1361">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1361</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we discuss a construction of CSS codes derived from pairs of practical irregular LDPC codes. Our design of irregular LDPC codes is based the design written in the standardization of IEEE802.16e. Our research has tried to make a CSS code with a pair of LDPC codes of type IEEE802.16e. To our regret, we proved that it was impossible to construct a CSS code if one of classical codes was of type IEEE802.16e with rate 1/2 and 2/3B. We would like to report the discussion on its impossibility in this paper. This is the first paper to analyze the possibility of a CSS code construction by using two irregular LDPC codes which are practically useful.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum Error-Correcting Codes with Preexisting Protected Qubits</strong><br>
Ying Dong, Xiuhao Deng, Mingming Jiang, Qing Chen, Sixia Yu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1379">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1379</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a systematic way of constructing entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes via graph states in the scenario of preexisting perfectly protected qubits. It turns out that the preexisting entanglement can help beat the quantum Hamming bound and can enhance (not only behave as an assistance) the performance of the quantum error correction. Furthermore we generalize the error models to the case of not-so-perfectly-protected qubits and introduce the quantity infidelity as a figure of merit and show that our code outperforms also the ordinary quantum error-correcting codes.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum Error Correction Code in the Hamiltonian Formulation</strong><br>
Yong Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2561">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2561</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Hamiltonian model of quantum error correction code in the literature is often constructed with the help of its stabilizer formalism. But there have been many known examples of nonadditive codes which are beyond the standard quantum error correction theory using the stabilizer formalism. In this paper, we suggest the other type of Hamiltonian formalism for quantum error correction code without involving the stabilizer formalism, and explain it by studying the Shor nine-qubit code and its generalization. In this Hamiltonian formulation, the unitary evolution operator at a specific time is a unitary basis transformation matrix from the product basis to the quantum error correction code. This basis transformation matrix acts as an entangling quantum operator transforming a separate state to an entangled one, and hence the entanglement nature of the quantum error correction code can be explicitly shown up. Furthermore, as it forms a unitary representation of the Artin braid group, the quantum error correction code can be described by a braiding operator. Moreover, as the unitary evolution operator is a solution of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation, the corresponding Hamiltonian model can be explained as an integrable model in the Yang--Baxter theory. On the other hand, we generalize the Shor nine-qubit code and articulate a topic called quantum error correction codes using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states to yield new nonadditive codes and channel-adapted codes.

<p><strong>11.    An application of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm to formal languages and the word problem in groups</strong><br>
Michael Batty, Andrea Casaccino, Andrew J. Duncan, Sarah Rees, Simone Severini<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2801">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2801</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We adapt the Deutsch-Josza algorithm to the context of formal language theory. Specifically, we use the algorithm to distinguish between trivial and nontrivial words in groups given by finite presentations, under the promise that a word is of a certain type. This is done by extending the original algorithm to functions of arbitrary length binary output, with the introduction of a more general concept of parity. We provide examples in which properties of the algorithm allow to reduce the number of oracle queries with respect to the deterministic classical case. This has some consequences for the word problem in groups with a particular kind of presentation.

<p><strong>12.    Multi-phase matching in the Grover algorithm</strong><br>
F.M. Toyama, W. van Dijk, Y. Nogami, M. Tabuchi, Y. Kimura<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2956">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2956</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Phase matching has been studied for the Grover algorithm as a way of enhancing the efficiency of the quantum search. Recently Li and Li found that a particular form of phase matching yields, with a single Grover operation, a success probability greater than 25/27 for finding the equal-amplitude superposition of marked states when the fraction of the marked states stored in a database state is greater than 1/3. Although this single operation eliminates the oscillations of the success probability that occur with multiple Grover operations, the latter oscillations reappear with multiple iterations of Li and Li&#39;s phase matching. In this paper we introduce a multi-phase matching subject to a certain matching rule by which we can obtain a multiple Grover operation that with only a few iterations yields a success probability that is almost constant and unity over a wide range of the fraction of marked items. As an example we show that a multi-phase operation with six iterations yields a success probability between 99.8% and 100% for a fraction of marked states of 1/10 or larger.

<p><strong>13.    Manifold algorithmic errors in quantum computers with static internal imperfections</strong><br>
Murat Cetinbas, Joshua Wilkie<br>
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 41 (2008) 065302<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3136">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3136</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The inevitable existence of static internal imperfections and residual interactions in some quantum computer architectures result in internal decoherence, dissipation, and destructive unitary shifts of active algorithms. By exact numerical simulations we determine the relative importance and origin of these errors for a Josephson charge qubit quantum computer. In particular we determine that the dynamics of a CNOT gate interacting with its idle neighboring qubits via native residual coupling behaves much like a perturbed kicked top in the exponential decay regime, where fidelity decay is only weakly dependent on perturbation strength. This means that retroactive removal of gate errors (whether unitary or non-unitary) may not be possible, and that effective error correction schemes must operate concurrently with the implementation of subcomponents of the gate.

<p><strong>15.    Quantum walks on Erdos-Renyi networks</strong><br>

Phys. Lett. A 372, 6727 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4115">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4115</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the coherent exciton transport of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on Erdos-Renyi networks. The Erdos-Renyi network of N nodes is constructed by connecting every pair of nodes with probability $p$. We numerically calculate the ensemble averaged transition probability of quantum transport between two nodes of the networks. For finite networks, we find that the limiting transition probability is reached very quickly. For infinite networks whose spectral density follows the semicircle law, the efficiencies of the classical and quantum-mechanical transport are compared on networks of different average degree. In the long time limiting, we consider the distribution of the ensemble averaged transition probabilities, and show that there is a high probability to find the exciton at the initial node. Such high return probability almost do not alter in a wide range of connection probability p but increases rapidly when the network approaches to be fully connected. For networks whose topology is not extremely connected, the return probability is inversely proportional to the network size N. Furthermore, the transport dynamics are compared with that on a random graph model in which the degree of each node equals to the average degree of the Erdos-Renyi networks.

<p><strong>16.    Continuous-time quantum walks on one-dimension regular networks</strong><br>
Xinping Xu, Feng Liu<br>
Phys. Rev. E 77, 061127 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4180">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4180</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on one-dimension ring lattice of N nodes in which every node is connected to its 2m nearest neighbors (m on either side). In the framework of the Bloch function ansatz, we calculate the spacetime transition probabilities between two nodes of the lattice. We find that the transport of CTQWs between two different nodes is faster than that of the classical continuous-time random walk (CTRWs). The transport speed, which is defined by the ratio of the shortest path length and propagating time, increases with the connectivity parameter m for both the CTQWs and CTRWs. For fixed parameter m, the transport of CTRWs gets slow with the increase of the shortest distance while the transport (speed) of CTQWs turns out to be a constant value. In the long time limit, depending on the network size N and connectivity parameter m, the limiting probability distributions of CTQWs show various paterns. When the network size N is an even number, the probability of being at the original node differs from that of being at the opposite node, which also depends on the precise value of parameter m.

<p><strong>17.    Quantum walks: a Markovian perspective</strong><br>
Diego de Falco, Dario Tamascelli<br>
V. Geffert et al. (Eds.): SOFSEM 2008, LNCS 4910, pp. 519-530, 2008<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4515">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4515</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a continuous-time quantum walk on a line the variance of the position observable grows quadratically in time, whereas, for its classical counterpart on the same graph, it exhibits a linear, diffusive, behaviour. A quantum walk, thus, propagates at a rate which is linear in time, as compared to the square root rate for a classical random walk. Indeed, it has been suggested that there are graphs that can be traversed by a quantum walker exponentially faster than by the classical random analogue. In this note we adopt the approach of exploring the conditions to impose on a Markov process in order to emulate its quantum counterpart: the central issue that emerges is the problem of taking into account, in the numerical generation of each sample path, the causative effect of the ensemble of trajectories to which it belongs. How to deal numerically with this problem is shown in a paradigmatic example.

The spatial self-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a high-finesse linear optical cavity is discussed. The condensate atoms are laser-driven from the side and scatter photons into the cavity. Above a critical pump intensity the homogeneous condensate evolves into a stable pattern bound by the cavity field. The transition point is determined analytically from a mean-field theory. We calculate the lowest lying Bogoliubov excitations of the coupled BEC-cavity system and the quantum depletion due to the atom-field coupling.

<p><strong>20.    Quantum entanglement analysis based on abstract interpretation</strong><br>
Simon Perdrix<br>
Proc. of 15th International Static Analysis Symposium (SAS 2008). LNCS 5079, pp 270-282<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4230">http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4230</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement is a non local property of quantum states which has no classical counterpart and plays a decisive role in quantum information theory. Several protocols, like the teleportation, are based on quantum entangled states. Moreover, any quantum algorithm which does not create entanglement can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. The exact role of the entanglement is nevertheless not well understood. Since an exact analysis of entanglement evolution induces an exponential slowdown, we consider approximative analysis based on the framework of abstract interpretation. In this paper, a concrete quantum semantics based on superoperators is associated with a simple quantum programming language. The representation of entanglement, i.e. the design of the abstract domain is a key issue. A representation of entanglement as a partition of the memory is chosen. An abstract semantics is introduced, and the soundness of the approximation is proven.
