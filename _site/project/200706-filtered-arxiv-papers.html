    <p><strong>1.    Efficient quantum circuit implementation of quantum walks</strong><br>
B. L. Douglas, J. B. Wang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0304">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0304</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks, being the quantum analogue of classical random walks, are expected to provide a fruitful source of quantum algorithms. A few such algorithms have already been developed, including the `glued trees&#39; algorithm, which provides an exponential speedup over classical methods, relative to a particular quantum oracle. Here, we discuss the possibility of a quantum walk algorithm yielding such an exponential speedup over possible classical algorithms, without the use of an oracle. We provide examples of some highly symmetric graphs on which efficient quantum circuits implementing quantum walks can be constructed, and discuss potential applications to quantum search for marked vertices along these graphs.

<p><strong>2.    How to Compile Some NAND Formula Evaluators</strong><br>
Robert R. Tucci<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0479">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0479</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We say a unitary operator acting on a set of qubits has been compiled if it has been expressed as a SEO (sequence of elementary operations, like CNOTs and single-qubit operations). SEO&#39;s are often represented as quantum circuits. arXiv:quant-ph/0702144 by Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann has inspired a recent flurry of papers, that propose quantum algorithms for evaluating NAND formulas via quantum walks over tree graphs. These algorithms use two types of unitary evolution: oracle and non-oracle. Non-oracle evolutions are independent of the NAND formula input, whereas oracle evolutions depend on this input. In this paper we compile (i.e., give explicit SEOs and their associated quantum circuits for) the oracle and non-oracle evolution operators used in some of these NAND formula evaluators. We consider here only the case of balanced binary NAND trees. Our compilation methods are based on the CSD (Cosine Sine Decomposition), a matrix decomposition from Linear Algebra. The CS decomposition has been used very successfully in the past to compile unstructured unitary matrices exactly.

<p><strong>3.    Higher order antibunching in intermediate states</strong><br>
A Verma, N K Sharma, A Pathak<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0697">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0697</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since the introduction of binomial state as an intermediate state, different intermediate states have been proposed. Different nonclassical effects have also been reported in these intermediate states. But till now higher order antibunching or higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is predicted only in one type of intermediate state, namely shadowed negative binomial state. Recently we have shown the existence of higher order antibunching in some simple nonlinear optical processes to establish that higher order antibunching is not a rare phenomenon (J. Phys. B 39 (2006) 1137). To establish our earlier claim further, here we have shown that the higher order antibunching can be seen in different intermediate states, such as binomial state, reciprocal binomial state, hypergeometric state, generalized binomial state, negative binomial state and photon added coherent state. We have studied the possibility of observing the higher order subpoissonian photon statistics in different limits of intermediate states. The effect of different control parameters have also been studied in this connection and it has been shown that the depth of nonclassicality can be tuned by controlling various physical parameters.

<p><strong>4.    Non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of quantum continuous variable systems in thermal environments</strong><br>
Kuan-Liang Liu, Hsi-Sheng Goan<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 022312 (2007) (12 pages)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0996">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0996</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study two continuous variable systems (or two harmonic oscillators) and investigate their entanglement evolution under the influence of non-Markovian thermal environments. The continuous variable systems could be two modes of electromagnetic fields or two nanomechanical oscillators in the quantum domain. We use quantum open system method to derive the non-Markovian master equations of the reduced density matrix for two different but related models of the continuous variable systems. The two models both consist of two interacting harmonic oscillators. In model A, each of the two oscillators is coupled to its own independent thermal reservoir, while in model B the two oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir. To quantify the degrees of entanglement for the bipartite continuous variable systems in Gaussian states, logarithmic negativity is used. We find that the dynamics of the quantum entanglement is sensitive to the initial states, the oscillator-oscillator interaction, the oscillator-environment interaction and the coupling to a common bath or to different, independent baths.

<p><strong>5.    Discrimination of the binary coherent signal: Gaussian-operation limit and simple non-Gaussian near-optimal receivers</strong><br>
Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 022320 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1038">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1038</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We address the limit of the Gaussian operations and classical communication in the problem of quantum state discrimination. We show that the optimal Gaussian strategy for the discrimination of the binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) coherent signal is a simple homodyne detection. We also propose practical near-optimal quantum receivers that beat the BPSK homodyne limit in all areas of the signal power. Our scheme is simple and does not require realtime electrical feedback.

<p><strong>6.    Sequential weak measurement</strong><br>
Graeme Mitchison, Richard Jozsa, Sandu Popescu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1508">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1508</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The notion of weak measurement provides a formalism for extracting information from a quantum system in the limit of vanishing disturbance to its state. Here we extend this formalism to the measurement of sequences of observables. When these observables do not commute, we may obtain information about joint properties of a quantum system that would be forbidden in the usual strong measurement scenario. As an application, we provide a physically compelling characterisation of the notion of counterfactual quantum computation.

<p><strong>7.    Supersymmetric Construction of three-dimensional isospectral systems</strong><br>
Yoshihide Yamada<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1613">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1613</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Three-dimensional isospectral systems are constructed using the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In case the supercharge of first order in momentum is used, it is proved that the constructed systems reduce to a trivial generalization of one-dimensional systems. In case the second order supercharge is used, nontrivial three-dimensional isospectral systems are constructed.

<p><strong>8.    Extraspecial Two-Groups, Generalized Yang-Baxter Equations and Braiding Quantum Gates</strong><br>
Eric C. Rowell, Yong Zhang, Yong-Shi Wu, Mo-Lin Ge<br>
Quant.Inf.Comput.10:685-702,2010<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1761">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1761</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we describe connections among extraspecial 2-groups, unitary representations of the braid group and multi-qubit braiding quantum gates. We first construct new representations of extraspecial 2-groups. Extending the latter by the symmetric group, we construct new unitary braid representations, which are solutions to generalized Yang-Baxter equations and use them to realize new braiding quantum gates. These gates generate the GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states, for an arbitrary (particularly an \emph{odd}) number of qubits, from the product basis. We also discuss the Yang-Baxterization of the new braid group representations, which describes unitary evolution of the GHZ states. Our study suggests that through their connection with braiding gates, extraspecial 2-groups and the GHZ states may play an important role in quantum error correction and topological quantum computing.

<p><strong>9.    Entanglement measures and approximate quantum error correction</strong><br>
Francesco Buscemi<br>
Phys. Rev. A 77, 012309 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1815">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1815</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is shown that, if the loss of entanglement along a quantum channel is sufficiently small, then approximate quantum error correction is possible, thereby generalizing what happens for coherent information. Explicit bounds are obtained for the entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement, and their validity naturally extends to other bipartite entanglement measures in between. Robustness of derived criteria is analyzed and their tightness compared. Finally, as a byproduct, we prove a bound quantifying how large the gap between entanglement of formation and distillable entanglement can be for any given finite dimensional bipartite system, thus providing a sufficient condition for distillability in terms of entanglement of formation.

<p><strong>10.    Universal discriminator for completely unknown optical qubits</strong><br>
Bing He, Janos A. Bergou, Yuhang Ren<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2429">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2429</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an experimental setup that is capable of unambiguously discriminating any pair of linearly independent single photon polarization qubits, about which we don&#39;t have any knowledge except that an extra pair of these unknown states are provided as the reference. This setup, which is constructed with optical CNOT gates, weak cross Kerr non-linearities, Bell state analysers and other linear optical elements, transforms the unknown triple photon input states to the corresponding single photon states to be deterministically processed by linear optics circuit. The optimal discrimination of the unknown states is achieved by this setup.

<p><strong>11.    Quantum Discrete Fourier Transform with Classical Output for Signal Processing</strong><br>
Chao-Yang Pang, Ben-Qiong Hu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2451">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2451</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the base of modern signal or information processing. 1-Dimensional fast Fourier transform (1D FFT) and 2D FFT have time complexity O(NlogN) and O(N^2logN) respectively. Quantum 1D and 2D DFT algorithms with classical output (1D QDFT and 2D QDFT) are presented in this paper. And quantum algorithm for convolution estimation is also presented in this paper. Compared with FFT, QDFT has two advantages at least. One of advantages is that 1D and 2D QDFT has time complexity O(sqrt(N)) and O(N) respectively. The other advantage is that QDFT can process very long signal sequence at a time. QDFT and quantum convolution demonstrate that quantum signal processing with classical output is possible.

We present and characterize a versatile experimental setup which allows for excitation and detection of Rydberg atoms in quantum gases.

The setup presented here is applicable to all atomic species used in the field of quantum gases. We describe and characterize the production of Bose-Einstein condensates, the excitation scheme into Rydberg states, the detection of Rydberg states by field ionization followed by ion detection and the various electric field configurations provided by the eight field plates.

<p><strong>14.    Channel-Adapted Quantum Error Correction</strong><br>
Andrew S. Fletcher<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3400">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3400</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential concept for any quantum information processing device. Typically, QEC is designed with minimal assumptions about the noise process; this generic assumption exacts a high cost in efficiency and performance. In physical systems, errors are not likely to be arbitrary; rather we will have reasonable models for the structure of quantum decoherence. We may choose quantum error correcting codes and recovery operations that specifically target the most likely errors. We present a convex optimization method to determine the optimal (in terms of average entanglement fidelity) recovery operation for a given channel, encoding, and information source. This is solvable via a semidefinite program (SDP). We present computational algorithms to generate near-optimal recovery operations structured to begin with a projective syndrome measurement. These structured operations are more computationally scalable than the SDP required for computing the optimal; we can thus numerically analyze longer codes. Using Lagrange duality, we bound the performance of the structured recovery operations and show that they are nearly optimal in many relevant cases. We present two classes of channel-adapted quantum error correcting codes specifically designed for the amplitude damping channel. These have significantly higher rates with shorter block lengths than corresponding generic quantum error correcting codes. Both classes are stabilizer codes, and have good fidelity performance with stabilizer recovery operations. The encoding, syndrome measurement, and syndrome recovery operations can all be implemented with Clifford group operations.

<p><strong>15.    Measurement-based quantum computation beyond the one-way model</strong><br>
D. Gross, J. Eisert, N. Schuch, D. Perez-Garcia<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 052315 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3401">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3401</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce novel schemes for quantum computing based on local measurements on entangled resource states. This work elaborates on the framework established in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 220503 (2007), quant-ph/0609149]. Our method makes use of tools from many-body physics - matrix product states, finitely correlated states or projected entangled pairs states - to show how measurements on entangled states can be viewed as processing quantum information. This work hence constitutes an instance where a quantum information problem - how to realize quantum computation - was approached using tools from many-body theory and not vice versa. We give a more detailed description of the setting, and present a large number of new examples. We find novel computational schemes, which differ from the original one-way computer for example in the way the randomness of measurement outcomes is handled. Also, schemes are presented where the logical qubits are no longer strictly localized on the resource state. Notably, we find a great flexibility in the properties of the universal resource states: They may for example exhibit non-vanishing long-range correlation functions or be locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. We discuss variants of Kitaev&#39;s toric code states as universal resources, and contrast this with situations where they can be efficiently classically simulated. This framework opens up a way of thinking of tailoring resource states to specific physical systems, such as cold atoms in optical lattices or linear optical systems.

<p><strong>16.    An echo experiment in a strongly interacting Rydberg gas</strong><br>
Ulrich Raitzsch, Vera Bendkowsky, Rolf Heidemann, Bj?rn Butscher, Robert L?w, Tilman Pfau<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, p. 013002 (2008)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
When ground state atoms are excited to a Rydberg state, van der Waals interactions among them can lead to a strong suppression of the excitation. Despite the strong interactions the evolution can still be reversed by a simple phase shift in the excitation laser field. We experimentally prove the coherence of the excitation in the strong blockade regime by applying an `optical rotary echo&#39; technique to a sample of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms, analogous to a method known from nuclear magnetic resonance. We additionally measured the dephasing time due to the interaction between the Rydberg atoms.

<blockquote>
<p>
In the weak measurement formalism of Y. Aharonov et al. the so-called weak value A_w of any observable A is generally a complex number. We derive a physical interpretation of its value in terms of the shift in the measurement pointer&#39;s mean position and mean momentum. In particular we show that the mean position shift contains a term jointly proportional to the imaginary part of the weak value and the rate at which the pointer is spreading in space as it enters the measurement interaction.

We optimise the POVM for a given input state and fixed arrangement. Then we also optimise the input state for some specific cost functions. In all cases, the optimal POVM is equivalent to a quantum Fourier transform in an appropriate basis. Examples and applications are given.

Open quantum systems that interact with structured reservoirs exhibit non-Markovian dynamics. We present a quantum jump method for treating the dynamics of such systems. This approach is a generalization of the standard Monte Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method for Markovian dynamics. The MCWF method identifies decay rates with jump probabilities and fails for non-Markovian systems where the time-dependent rates become temporarily negative. Our non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach circumvents this problem and provides an efficient unravelling of the ensemble dynamics.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1536">http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1536</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Results on matrix canonical forms are used to give a complete description of the higher rank numerical range of matrices arising from the study of quantum error correction. It is shown that the set can be obtained as the intersection of closed half planes (of complex numbers). As a result, it is always a convex set in $\mathcal C$. Moreover, the higher rank numerical range of a normal matrix is a convex polygon determined by the eigenvalues. These two consequences confirm the conjectures of Choi et al. on the subject. In addition, the results are used to derive a formula for the optimal upper bound for the dimension of a totally isotropic subspace of a square matrix, and verify the solvability of certain matrix equations.
