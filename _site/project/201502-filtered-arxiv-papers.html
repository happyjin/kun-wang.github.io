    <p><strong>1.    Single Semiconductor Quantum Dots in Microcavities: Bright sources of indistinguishable Photons</strong><br>
C. Schneider, P. Gold, C.-Y. Lu, S. H?fling, J.-W. Pan, M. Kamp<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00160">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00160</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this chapter we will discuss the technology and experimental techniques to realize quantum dot (QD) single photon sources combining high outcoupling efficiencies and highest degrees of non-postselected photon indistinguishability. The system, which is based on ultra low density InAs QDs embedded in a quasi planar single sided microcavity with natural photonic traps is an ideal testbed to study quantum light emission from single QDs. We will discuss the influence of the excitation conditions on the purity of the single photon emission, and in particular on the degree of indistinguishability of the emitted photons. While high purity triggered emission of single photons is observed under all tested excitation conditions, single photon interference effects can be almost vanish in experiments relying on non-resonant pumping into the quantum dot wetting layer. In contrast, we can observe nearly perfect indistinguishability of single photons in resonance fluorescence excitation conditions, which underlines the superiority of this excitation scheme to create photon wave packets close to the Fourier limit. As a first step towards the realization of solid state quantum networks based on quantum dot single photon sources we test the overlap of photons emitted from remote QDs yielding non-postselected interference visibilities on the order of ~40% for quasi resonant excitation.

<p><strong>2.    Entanglement Properties of Localized States in 1D Topological Quantum Walks</strong><br>
C. M. Chandrashekar, H. Obuse, Th. Busch<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The symmetries associated with discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) and the flexibilities in controlling their dynamical parameters allow to create a large number of topological phases. An interface in position space, which separates two regions with different topological numbers, can, for example, be effectively modelled using different coin parameters for the walk on either side of the interface. Depending on the neighbouring numbers, this can lead to localized states in one-dimensional configurations and here we carry out a detailed study into the strength of such localized states. We show that it can be related to the amount of entanglement created by the walks, with minima appearing for strong localizations. This feature also persists in the presence of small amounts of $\sigma_x$ (bit flip) noise.

<p><strong>3.    Dense Coding with Linear Optics without Bell State Measurements</strong><br>
P. Lougovski, D. B. Uskov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00554">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00554</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that the efficiency of linear optical implementations of the dense coding is limited by one&#39;s ability to discriminate between the four optically encoded Bell states. The best experimental demonstration up to date reports the transmission of $\approx$ 1.63 bits of information per single optical qubit which is less than the theoretical bound of 2.0 bits for a generic qubit. We show that besides the Bell states there is a class of bipartite two-photon entangled states that can also facilitate dense coding. However, in contrast to the Bell states, they can be deterministically discriminated by means of linear optics and coincidence photo detection without using any auxiliary entanglement resources. We discuss how the proposed dense coding scheme can be generalized to the case of two-photon $N$-mode entangled states for $N=6,8$.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum code for quantum error characterization</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. A 91, 052309 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00617">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00617</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum error correcting code is a subspace $\mathcal{C}$ such that allowed errors acting on any state in $\mathcal{C}$ can be corrected. A quantum code for which state recovery is only required up to a logical rotation within $\mathcal{C}$, can be used for detection of errors, but not for quantum error correction. Such a code with stabilizer structure, which we call an &quot;ambiguous stabilizer code&quot; (ASC), can nevertheless be useful for the characterization of quantum dynamics (CQD). The use of ASCs can help lower the size of CQD probe states used, but at the cost of increased number of operations.

<p><strong>5.    Single-mode nonclassicality criteria via Holstein-Primakoff transformation</strong><br>
Mehmet Emre Tasgin<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00988">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00988</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, two quantifications for nonclassicality of a single-mode field are shown to be equivalent; (i) the rank of entanglement it can generate by a beam-splitter and (ii) the number of terms needed to expand it as superposition of coherent states. We show that nonclassicality criteria can be obtained with an alternative approach. The rank of two-mode entanglement among 2-level identical particles converges to the rank of single-mode nonclassicality within the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, at the large particle number limit. In particular, we show that the entanglement criterion of Hillery &amp; Zubairy converges to the Mandel&#39;s $Q$-parameter which is used to reveal nonclassicality, and spin-squeezing criterion of S{\o}rensen et al. converges to single-mode squeezing condition. We obtain additional nonclassicality criteria not existing in the literature. We also discuss if single-mode nonclassicality can be visualized as the entanglement of space generating the photons. Moreover, in a forthcoming study we show that, linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity becomes noncausal above the critical coupling where output single-mode field becomes nonclassical.

<p><strong>6.    Single-mode nonclassicality measure from Simon-Peres-Horodecki criterion</strong><br>
Mehmet Emre Tasgin<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00992">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00992</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nonclassicality of a single-mode field is equivalent to the rank of two-mode entanglement this field generates at the output of a beam-splitter [Phys. Rev. A 89, 052302 (2014)]. We derive a measure for the nonclassicality of a single-mode field using the two-mode inseparability measure of Simon-Peres-Horodecki. Degree of the single-mode nonclassicality requires the knowledge of only $\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle$ and $\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$. This condition/measure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for Gaussian single-mode states. We show that this measure increases with squeezing strength and display a jump at the critical coupling for a superradiant phase transition. Additionally, we derive a simple analytical condition, $|\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle|&gt;\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$, for nonclassicality from Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion. In a forthcoming study, we use the derived measure to show the following. Non-causal linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity emerges at the same critical cavity-mechanical coupling where output field becomes nonclassical.

<p><strong>7.    Security Analysis of Slicing Methods during Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution</strong><br>
Elizabeth Newton, Matthew C.J. Everitt, Freya L. Wilson, Benjamin T.H. Varcoe<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01169">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01169</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Experimental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols have to consist of not only the unconditionally secure quantum transmission, but also a subsequent classical exchange that enables key reconciliation and error correction. The details of the classical part of the protocol are often overlooked in favour of the more exciting quantum part. However the linking together of several secure protocols can unexpectedly leak information to an eavesdropper, even if the components are unconditionally secure in isolation. This oversight could be catastrophic as any secrecy gained during the quantum transmission can be easily and unknowingly lost during the classical one. In fact we show that in merely crossing the quantum-classical boundary some security is always lost. In this paper we examine how the local transfer between a state received quantumly to one processed classically can lower the secrecy of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD), even without any communication between parties. While this particular example applies to only CVQKD, it highlights the need to re-examine the way individual protocols are actually used.

<p><strong>8.    Mutual emergence of noncausal optical response and nonclassicality in an optomechanical system</strong><br>
Devrim Tarhan, Mehmet Emre Tasgin<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01294">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01294</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that single-mode nonclassicality of the output of an optomechanical cavity and the noncausal linear optical response of this cavity emerge at the same critical cavity-mechanical coupling. In other words, single-mode nonclassicality emerges when the barrier (in electromagnetism) avoiding faster-than-light communication is lifted off. The nature of the emergence of noncausal behavior does not depend on the length (boundary conditions) and the type of the cavity. Origin of the noncausal behavior is the temporal/frequency relations between the incident and reflected waves at the outer surface of the cavity. We further discuss the relations with the recent studies; (i) equivalence of the entanglement among identical particles to the nonclassicality of their quasiparticle excitations, (ii) necessity of superfluid behavior of vacuum, and (iii) entanglement-wormhole equivalence.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01680">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01680</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an idea to convert to a unitary quantum walk any open quantum walk which is defined on lattices as well as on finite graphs. This approach generalizes to the domain of open quantum walks (or quantum Markov chains) the framework introduced by Szegedy for quantizing Markov chains. For the unitary quantum walks formulated in this article, we define the probability and the mean probability of finding the walk at a node, then derive the asymptotic mean probability.

<blockquote>
<p>
For every possible spectrum of $2^N$-dimensional density operators, we construct an $N$-qubit X-state of same spectrum and maximal genuine multipartite (GM-) concurrence, hence characterizing a global unitary transformation that --- constrained to output X-states --- maximizes the GM-concurrence of an arbitrary input mixed state of $N$ qubits. We also apply semidefinite programming methods to obtain $N$-qubit X-states with maximal GM-concurrence for a given purity and to provide an alternative proof of optimality of a recently proposed set of density matrices for the role, the so-called X-MEMS. Furthermore, we introduce a numerical strategy to tailor a quantum operation that converts between any two given density matrices using a relatively small number of Kraus operators. We apply our strategy to design short operator-sum representations for the transformation between any given $N$-qubit mixed state and a corresponding X-MEMS of same purity.

<p><strong>11.    Dynamical decoupling efficiency versus quantum non-Markovianity</strong><br>
Carole Addis, Francesco Ciccarello, Michele Cascio, G. Massimo Palma, Sabrina Maniscalco<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02528">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02528</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the relationship between non-Markovianity and the effectiveness of a dynamical decoupling protocol for qubits undergoing pure dephasing. We consider an exact model in which dephasing arises due to a bosonic environment with a spectral density of the Ohmic class. This is parametrised by an Ohmicity parameter by changing which we can model both Markovian and non-Markovian environments. Interestingly, we find that engineering a non-Markovian environment is detrimental to the efficiency of the dynamical decoupling scheme, leading to a worse coherence preservation. We show that each dynamical decoupling pulse reverses the flow of quantum information and, on this basis, we investigate the connection between dynamical decoupling efficiency and the reservoir spectral density. Finally, in the spirit of reservoir engineering, we investigate the optimum system-reservoir parameters for achieving maximum stationary coherences.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02592">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02592</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of one-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the symmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are allowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the classification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band structure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever, and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and -1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a single gap at zero.

<p><strong>13.    Hyperentanglement concentration for time-bin and polarization hyperentangled photons</strong><br>
Xihan Li, Shohini Ghose<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02891">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02891</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two hyperentanglement concentration schemes for two-photon states that are partially entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. The first scheme distills a maximally hyperentangled state from two identical less-entangled states with unknown parameters via the Schmidt projection method. The other scheme can be used to concentrate an initial state with known parameters, and requires only one copy of the initial state for the concentration process. Both these two protocols can be generalized to concentrate N-photon hyperentangled Greenberger- Horne-Zeilinger states that are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. Our schemes require only linear optics and are feasible with current technology. Using the time-bin degree of freedom rather than the spatial mode degree of freedom can provide savings in quantum resources, which makes our schemes practical and useful for long-distance quantum communication.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03061">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03061</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Particle delocalization is a common feature of quantum random walks in arbitrary lattices. However, in the typical scenario a particle spreads over multiple sites and its evolution is not directly useful for controlled quantum interferometry, as may be required for technological applications. In this paper we devise a strategy to perfectly split the wave-packet of an incoming particle into two components, each propagating in opposite directions, which reconstruct the shape of the initial wavefunction after a particular time $t^<em>$. Therefore, a particle in a delta-like initial state becomes exactly delocalized between two distant sites after $t^</em>$. We find the mathematical conditions to achieve the perfect splitting which are satisfied by viable example Hamiltonians with static site-dependent interaction strengths. Our results pave the way for the generation of peculiar many-body interference patterns in a many-site atomic chain (like the Hanbury Brown and Twiss and quantum Talbot effects) as well as for the distribution of entanglement between remote sites. Thus, as for the case of perfect state transfer, the perfect wave-packet splitting can be a new tool for varied applications.

<p><strong>15.    Transport of quantum excitations via local and nonlocal fluctuations</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03328">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03328</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum systems, one usually seeks to minimize dephasing noise and disorder. The efficiency of transport in a quantum system is usually degraded by the presence of noise and disorder. However, it has been shown that the combination of the two can lead to significantly more efficiency than each by itself. Here, we consider how the addition of nonlocal noise, in the form of incoherent hopping, affects the transport efficiency. We show that incoherent hopping introduces additional local extrema in the efficiency function and investigate the crossover from a quantum random walk to a classical random walk.

Parity measurement is a central tool to many quantum information processing tasks. In this Letter, we propose a method to directly measure two- and four-qubit parity with low overhead in hard- and software, while remaining robust to experimental imperfections. Our scheme relies on dispersive qubit-cavity coupling and photon counting that is sensitive only to intensity; both ingredients are widely realized in many different quantum computing modalities. For a leading technology in quantum computing, superconducting integrated circuits, we analyze the measurement contrast and the back action of the scheme and show that this measurement comes close enough to an ideal parity measurement to be applicable to quantum error correction.

Scaling up linear-optics quantum computing will require multi-photon gates which are compact, phase-stable, exhibit excellent quantum interference, and have success heralded by the detection of ancillary photons. We investigate implementation of the optimal known gate design which meets these requirements: the Knill controlled-Z gate, implemented in integrated laser-written waveguide arrays. We show that device performance is more sensitive to the small deviations in the coupler reflectivity, arising due to the tolerance values of the fabrication method, than phase variations in the circuit. The mode fidelity was also shown to be less sensitive to reflectivity and phase errors than process fidelity. Our best device achieves a fidelity of 0.931+/-0.001 with the ideal 4x4 unitary circuit and a process fidelity of 0.680+/-0.005 with the ideal computational-basis process.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03450">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03450</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the robustness of the bucket brigade quantum random access memory model introduced by Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)]. Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [ICALP &#39;08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order $o(2^{-n/2})$ (where $N=2^n$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as a oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of &quot;active&quot; gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study two-level systems (2LS) coupled at different points to a one-dimensional waveguide in which one end is open and the other is either open (infinite waveguide) or closed by a mirror (semi-infinite). Upon injection of two photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance fluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit transition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by interference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite waveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by stimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered here), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very long time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the transmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched. On the other hand, upon resonant driving, incoherently reflected photons are mostly distributed within the photonic band gap and several sharp side peaks. These features can be explained by considering the poles of the single particle Green function in the Markovian regime combined with the time delay. Our calculation is not restricted to the Markovian regime, and we obtain several fully non-Markovian results. We show that a single 2LS in a semi-infinite waveguide can not be decoupled by placing it at the node of the photonic field, in contrast to recent results in the Markovian regime. Our results illustrate the complexities that ensue when several qubits are strongly coupled to a bus (the waveguide) as might happen in quantum information processing.

We present a detailed analysis of continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) with both position and transition defects defined at a single point in the line. Analytical solutions of both traveling waves or bound states are obtained, which provide valuable insight into the dynamics of CTQW. The number of bound states is found to be critically dependent on the defect parameters, and the localized probability peaks can be readily obtained by projecting the CTQW wavefunction on to these bound states. The interference between two bound states are also observed in the case of a transition defect. The spreading of CTQW probability over the line can be finely tuned by varying the position and transition defect parameters, offering the possibility of precision quantum control of the system.

<p>
Multipartite quantum systems show properties which do not admit a classical explanation. In particular, even nonentangled states can enjoy a kind of quantum correlations called quantum discord. I discuss some recent results on the role of quantum discord in metrology. Given an interferometric phase estimation protocol where the Hamiltonian is initially unknown to the experimentalist, the quantum discord of the probe state quantifies the minimum precision of the estimation. This provides a physical interpretation to a widely investigated information-theoretic quantity.

We propose a quantum analogue, the lackadaisical quantum walk, where each vertex is given $l$ self-loops, and we investigate its effects on Grover&#39;s algorithm when formulated as search for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices. For the discrete-time quantum walk using the phase flip coin, adding a self-loop to each vertex boosts the success probability from 1/2 to 1. Additional self-loops, however, decrease the success probability. Using instead the Ambainis, Kempe, and Rivosh (2005) coin, adding self-loops simply slows down the search. These coins also differ in that the first is faster than classical when $l$ scales less than $N$, while the second requires that $l$ scale less than $N^2$. Finally, continuous-time quantum walks differ from both of these discrete-time examples---the self-loops make no difference at all. These behaviors generalize to multiple marked vertices.

<p><strong>25.    Strong non-linearity-induced correlations for counter-propagating photons scattering on a two-level emitter</strong><br>
Anders Nysteen, Dara P. S. McCutcheon, Jesper M?rk<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04729">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04729</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analytically treat the scattering of two counter-propagating photons on a two-level emitter embedded in an optical waveguide. We find that the non-linearity of the emitter can give rise to significant pulse-dependent directional correlations in the scattered photonic state, which could be quantified via a reduction in coincident clicks in a Hong-Ou-Mandel measurement setup, analogous to a linear beam splitter. Changes to the spectra and phase of the scattered photons, however, would lead to reduced interference with other photons when implemented in a larger optical circuit. We introduce suitable fidelity measures which account for these changes, and find that high values can still be achieved even when accounting for all properties of the scattered photonic state.

<p><strong>26.    Quantum Search with Multiple Walk Steps per Oracle Query</strong><br>
Thomas G. Wong, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04792">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04792</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We identify a key difference between discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks in search, that the former is typically restricted to one walk step per oracle query, whereas the latter can take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting query time. As a result, we show that continuous-time quantum walks can outperform their discrete-time counterparts, even though both achieve quadratic speedups over their corresponding classical random walks. To provide greater equity, we allow the discrete-time quantum walk to also take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting queries. Then it matches the continuous-time algorithm&#39;s runtime, but such that it is a cubic speedup over its corresponding classical random walk. This yields the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup for quantum search over its corresponding classical random walk.

<p><strong>27.    Quantum mixing of Markov chains for special distributions</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The preparation of the stationary distribution of irreducible, time-reversible Markov chains is a fundamental building block in many heuristic approaches to algorithmically hard problems. It has been conjectured that quantum analogs of classical mixing processes may offer a generic quadratic speed-up in realizing such stationary distributions. Such a speed-up would also imply a speed-up of a broad family of heuristic algorithms. However, a true quadratic speed up has thus far only been demonstrated for special classes of Markov chains. These results often presuppose a regular structure of the underlying graph of the Markov chain, and also a regularity in the transition probabilities. In this work, we demonstrate a true quadratic speed-up for a class of Markov chains where the restriction is only on the form of the stationary distribution, rather than directly on the Markov chain structure itself. In particular, we show efficient mixing can be achieved when it is beforehand known that the distribution is monotonically decreasing relative to a known order on the state space. Following this, we show that our approach extends to a wider class of distributions, where only a fraction of the shape of the distribution is known to be monotonic. Our approach is built on the Szegedy-type quantization of transition operators.

We prove the existence of collective Lamb-shifts that affect the qubit-qubit interactions and the dependency of coherent and incoherent interactions on the qubit separation. We also develop the scattering theory associated to these models and prove single photon spectroscopy does probes the renormalized resonances of the single- and multi-qubit models, in sharp contrast with earlier toy models where individual and collective Lamb shifts cancel.

We provide a systematic treatment of $N$-photon transport in a waveguide coupled to a local system, using the input-output formalism. The main result of the paper is a general connection between the $N$-photon S matrix and the Green functions of the local system. We also show that the computation can be significantly simplified, by exploiting the connectedness structure of both the S matrix and the Green function, and by computing the Green function using an effective Hamiltonian that involves only the degrees of freedom of the local system. We illustrate our formalism by computing $N$-photon transport through a cavity containing a medium with Kerr nonlinearity, with $N$ up to 3.

<blockquote>
<p>
The properties of the coinless quantum walk model have not been as thoroughly analyzed as those of the coined model. Both evolve in discrete time steps but the former uses a smaller Hilbert space, which is spanned merely by the site basis. Besides, the evolution operator can be obtained using a process of lattice tessellation, which is very appealing. The moments of the probability distribution play an important role in the context of quantum walks. The ballistic behavior of the mean square displacement indicates that quantum-walk-based algorithms are faster than random-walk-based ones. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the moments of the coinless model on $d$-dimensional lattices. The mean square displacement for large times is explicitly calculated for the one- and two-dimensional lattices and, using optimization methods, the parameter values that give the largest spread are calculated and compared with the equivalent ones of the coined model. Although we have employed asymptotic methods, our approximations are accurate even for small numbers of time steps.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum interference of correlated particles is a fundamental quantum phenomenon which carries signatures of the statistics properties of the particles, such as bunching or anti-bunching. In presence of particular symmetries, interference effects take place with high visibility, one of the simplest cases being the suppression of coincident detection in the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Tichy et al. recently demonstrated a simple sufficient criterion for the suppression of output events in the more general case of Fourier multi-port beam splitters. Here we study the case in which $2^q$ particles (either bosonic or fermionic) are injected simultaneously in different ports of a Sylvester interferometer with $2^p \geq 2^q$ modes. In particular, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for a significant fraction of output states to be suppressed, for specific input configurations. This may find application in assessing the indistinguishability of multiple single photon sources and in the validation of boson sampling machines.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum Rabi model describes the ultrastrong interaction of a two-level atom coupled to a single quantized bosonic mode. As compared to the Jaynes-Cummings model, in the Rabi model the absorption and emission processes do not need to satisfy energy conservation and the usual rotating wave approximation (RWA) breaks down. As a result, the atom-field dynamics in the Hilbert space splits into two independent parity chains, exhibiting a collapse-revival pattern and exact periodic dynamics in the limit of degenerate atomic levels. Here we introduce a mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model by considering a three-level atom interacting with two quantized bosonic fields, in which the RWA is made for one transition (with a weak atom-field coupling) but not for the other one (with an ultrastrong atom-field coupling). As a result, we show that the field in the weak coupled atomic transition can be used as a tool to control the atom-field dynamics of the other (strong coupled) transition, thus realizing an effective two-level quantum Rabi model with a controllable field. In particular, a periodic temporal dynamics of the atom-field state can be realized by appropriate tuning of the weak control field, even for non-degenerate atomic levels. A photonic simulator of the mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model, based on light transport in evanescently-coupled optical waveguide lattices, is also briefly discussed.

<blockquote>
<p>
Graph states are widely used in quantum information theory, including entanglement theory, quantum error correction, and one-way quantum computing. Graph states have a nice structure related to a certain graph, which is given by either a stabilizer group or an encoding circuit, both can be directly given by the graph. To generalize graph states, whose stabilizer groups are abelian subgroups of the Pauli group, one approach taken is to study non-abelian stabilizers. In this work, we propose to generalize graph states based on the encoding circuit, which is completely determined by the graph and a Hadamard matrix. We study the entanglement structures of these generalized graph states, and show that they are all maximally mixed locally. We also explore the relationship between the equivalence of Hadamard matrices and local equivalence of the corresponding generalized graph states. This leads to a natural generalization of the Pauli $(X,Z)$ pairs, which characterizes the local symmetries of these generalized graph states. Our approach is also naturally generalized to construct graph quantum codes which are beyond stabilizer codes.

<p>
Effects of time-dependent applied fields on quantum coupled double-well (DW) systems with Razavy&#39;s hyperbolic potential have been studied. By solving the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation for the DW system, we have obtained time-dependent occupation probabilities of the eigenstates, from which expectation values of positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of particles ($<x_1+x_2 >$), the correlation ($\Gamma(t)$) and the concurrence ($C(t)$) expressing a degree of the entanglement of the coupled DW system, are obtained. Analytical expressions for $<x_1+x_2 >$, $\Gamma(t)$ and $C(t)$ are derived with the use of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for sinusoidal fields. Model calculations have indicated that $<x_1+x_2 >$, $\Gamma(t)$ and $C(t)$ show very complicated time dependences. Results of the RWA are in good agreement with exact ones evaluated by numerical methods for cases of weak couplings and small applied fields in the near-resonant condition. Applications of our method to step fields are also studied.

<blockquote>
<p>
The Boson Sampler is a quantum device that, for large enough number of photons, beats any classical computer in the calculation of scattering probabilities between many-photon states. The complexity of this problem lies in the implicit calculation of permanents (determinants without the alternating minus signs) of large matrices, which is known to belong to the class of hard problems in classical algorithmic theory. Here we show that a semiclassical theory of Boson Sampling can be constructed such that its classical limit is a canonical transformation, while quantum interference is encoded in the semiclassical form of the associated unitary operator. Based on this idea, we study the different coherent effects expected under different choices of the scattering states and provide different representations of the scattering probabilities.

We describe the generation of atom-resonant indistinguishable photon pairs using nonlinear optical techniques, their spectral purification using atomic filters, characterization using multi-photon interference, and application to quantum-enhanced sensing with atoms. Using either type-I or type-II cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion, we generate pairs of photons in the resonant modes of optical cavities with linewidths comparable to the 6 MHz natural linewidth of the D$_1$ line of atomic rubidium. The cavities and pump lasers are tuned so that emission occurs in a mode or a pair of orthogonally-polarized modes that are resonant to the D$_1$ line, at 794.7 nm. The emission from these frequency-degenerate modes is separated from other cavity emission using ultra-narrow atomic frequency filters, either a Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF) with a 445MHz linewidth and 57 dB of out-of-band rejection or an induced dichroism filter with an 80 MHz linewidth and $\ge$35dB out-of-band rejection. Using the type-I source, we demonstrate interference of photon pair amplitudes against a coherent state and a new method for full characterization of the temporal wave-function of narrow-band photon pairs. With the type-II source we demonstrate high-visibility super-resolving interference, a high-fidelity atom-tuned NooN state, and quantum enhanced sensing of atoms using indistinguishable photon pairs.

Coherent oscillations of the charge qubit could be maintained in principle for an arbitrarily long time in case of sufficient feedback strength. The effectiveness of the feedback control is also reflected in the detector&#39;s noise spectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio rises significantly with increasing feedback strength such that it could even exceed the Korotkov-Averin bound in quantum measurement, manifesting almost ideal quantum coherent oscillations of the qubit.

A central goal in quantum information science is to efficiently interface photons with single optical modes for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact and efficient method for the low-loss coupling of a solid-state qubit, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, with a single-mode optical fibre. In this approach, single-mode tapered diamond waveguides containing exactly one high quality NV memory are selected and integrated on tapered silica fibres. Numerical optimization of an adiabatic coupler indicates that near-unity-efficiency photon transfer is possible between the two modes. Experimentally, we find an overall collection efficiency between 18-40 % and observe a raw single photon count rate above 700 kHz. This integrated system enables robust, alignment-free, and efficient interfacing of single-mode optical fibres with single photon emitters and quantum memories in solids.
