    <p><strong>1.    Quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis<br>
SIAM Journal on Computing, 37(1):210-239, 2007<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311001">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311001</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We use quantum walks to construct a new quantum algorithm for element distinctness and its generalization. For element distinctness (the problem of finding two equal items among N given items), we get an O(N^{2/3}) query quantum algorithm. This improves the previous O(N^{3/4}) query quantum algorithm of Buhrman et.al. (quant-ph/0007016) and matches the lower bound by Shi (quant-ph/0112086). The algorithm also solves the generalization of element distinctness in which we have to find k equal items among N items. For this problem, we get an O(N^{k/(k+1)}) query quantum algorithm.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum random walks with history dependence</strong><br>
Adrian P. Flitney, Derek Abbott, Neil F. Johnson<br>
J. Phys. A 37 (2004) 7581-7591<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311009">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311009</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a multi-coin discrete quantum random walk where the amplitude for a coin flip depends upon previous tosses. Although the corresponding classical random walk is unbiased, a bias can be introduced into the quantum walk by varying the history dependence. By mixing the biased random walk with an unbiased one, the direction of the bias can be reversed leading to a new quantum version of Parrondo&#39;s paradox.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum algorithms for subset finding</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Jason M. Eisenberg<br>
Quantum Information and Computation 5, 593 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311038">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311038</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Ambainis gave an O(N^(2/3))-query quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness, and more generally, an O(N^(L/(L+1)))-query algorithm for finding L equal numbers. We point out that this algorithm actually solves a much more general problem, the problem of finding a subset of size L that satisfies any given property. We review the algorithm and give a considerably simplified analysis of its query complexity. We present several applications, including two algorithms for the problem of finding an L-clique in an N-vertex graph. One of these algorithms uses O(N^(2L/(L+1))) edge queries, and the other uses \tilde{O}(N^((5L-2)/(2L+4))), which is an improvement for L &lt;= 5. The latter algorithm generalizes a recent result of Magniez, Santha, and Szegedy, who considered the case L=3 (finding a triangle). We also pose two open problems regarding continuous time quantum walk and lower bounds.

<p><strong>4.    Multilinear Formulas and Skepticism of Quantum Computing</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311039">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311039</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Several researchers, including Leonid Levin, Gerard &#39;t Hooft, and Stephen Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all experiments performed to date, but not for Shor&#39;s factoring algorithm. We investigate as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require n^{Omega(log n)} additions and tensor products even to approximate, which incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum mechanics into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the near future.

<p><strong>5.    Experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation of a squeezed state</strong><br>
Nobuyuki Takei, Takao Aoki, Satoshi Koike, Kenichiro Yoshino, Kentaro Wakui, Hidehiro Yonezawa, Takuji Hiraoka, Jun Mizuno, Masahiro Takeoka, Masashi Ban, Akira Furusawa<br>
Phys. Rev. A 72, 042304 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311056">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311056</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum teleportation of a squeezed state is demonstrated experimentally. Due to some inevitable losses in experiments, a squeezed vacuum necessarily becomes a mixed state which is no longer a minimum uncertainty state. We establish an operational method of evaluation for quantum teleportation of such a state using fidelity, and discuss the classical limit for the state. The measured fidelity for the input state is 0.85$\pm$ 0.05 which is higher than the classical case of 0.73$\pm$0.04. We also verify that the teleportation process operates properly for the nonclassical state input and its squeezed variance is certainly transferred through the process. We observe the smaller variance of the teleported squeezed state than that for the vacuum state input.

<p><strong>6.    Stationary pulses of light in an atomic medium</strong><br>
M. Bajcsy, A. S. Zibrov, M. D. Lukin<br>
Nature 426, 638-641 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311092">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311092</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Physical processes that could facilitate coherent control of light propagation are now actively explored. In addition to fundamental interest, these efforts are stimulated by possibilities to develop, for example, a quantum memory for photonic states. At the same time, controlled localization and storage of photonic pulses may allow novel approaches to manipulate light via enhanced nonlinear optical processes. Recently, Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can be held and released after a controllable interval. Our method creates pulses of light with stationary envelopes bound to an atomic spin coherence, raising new possibilities for photon state manipulation and non-linear optical processes at low light levels.

<p><strong>7.    Operator normalized quantum arrival times in the presence of interactions</strong><br>
G.C. Hegerfeldt, D. Seidel, J.G. Muga, B. Navarro<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 012110 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311107">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311107</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We model ideal arrival-time measurements for free quantum particles and for particles subject to an external interaction by means of a narrow and weak absorbing potential. This approach is related to the operational approach of measuring the first photon emitted from a two-level atom illuminated by a laser. By operator-normalizing the resulting time-of-arrival distribution, a distribution is obtained which for freely moving particles not only recovers the axiomatically derived distribution of Kijowski for states with purely positive momenta but is also applicable to general momentum components. For particles interacting with a square barrier the mean arrival time and corresponding ``tunneling time&#39;&#39; obtained at the transmission side of the barrier becomes independent of the barrier width (Hartman effect) for arbitrarily wide barriers, i.e., without the transition to the ultra-opaque, classical-like regime dominated by wave packet components above the barrier.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum Error Correction on Linear Nearest Neighbor Qubit Arrays</strong><br>
Austin G. Fowler, Charles D. Hill, Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg<br>
Phys. Rev. A 69, 042314 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311116">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311116</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A minimal depth quantum circuit implementing 5-qubit quantum error correction in a manner optimized for a linear nearest neighbor architecture is described. The canonical decomposition is used to construct fast and simple gates that incorporate the necessary swap operations. Simulations of the circuit&#39;s performance when subjected to discrete and continuous errors are presented. The relationship between the error rate of a physical qubit and that of a logical qubit is investigated with emphasis on determining the concatenated error correction threshold.

<p><strong>9.    Localization of Two-Dimensional Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Norio Inui, Yoshinao Konishi, Norio Konno<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311118">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311118</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Grover walk, which is related to the Grover&#39;s search algorithm on a quantum computer, is one of the typical discrete time quantum walks. However, a localization of the two-dimensional Grover walk starting from a fixed point is striking different from other types of quantum walks. The present paper explains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four Grover&#39;s operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It is shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator. In fact, the global time evolution of the quantum walk on a large lattice is mainly determined by the degree of degeneration. The dependence of the localization on the initial state is also considered by calculating the wave function analytically.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum Computing Discrete Logarithms with the Help of a Preprocessed State</strong><br>
Wim van Dam<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311134">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311134</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An alternative quantum algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem is presented. The algorithm uses two quantum registers and two Fourier transforms whereas Shor&#39;s algorithm requires three registers and four Fourier transforms. A crucial ingredient of the algorithm is a quantum state that needs to be constructed before we can perform the computation. After one copy of this state is created, the algorithm can be executed arbitrarily many times.

<p><strong>11.    A Quantum Information Theoretical Model for Quantum Secret Sharing Schemes</strong><br>
Hideki Imai, Joern Mueller-Quade, Anderson C. A. Nascimento, Pim Tuyls, Andreas Winter<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311136">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311136</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we introduce a quantum information theoretical model for quantum secret sharing schemes. We show that quantum information theory provides a unifying framework for the study of these schemes. We prove that the information theoretical requirements for a class of quantum secret sharing schemes reduce to only one requirement (the recoverability condition) as a consequence of the no-cloning principle. We give also a shorter proof of the fact that the size of the shares in a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at least as large as the secret itself.

<p><strong>12.    Lower bounds for randomized and quantum query complexity using Kolmogorov arguments</strong><br>
Sophie Laplante, Frederic Magniez<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311189">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311189</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove a very general lower bound technique for quantum and randomized query complexity, that is easy to prove as well as to apply. To achieve this, we introduce the use of Kolmogorov complexity to query complexity. Our technique generalizes the weighted, unweighted methods of Ambainis, and the spectral method of Barnum, Saks and Szegedy. As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, adversary methods can only prove lower bounds for boolean functions $f$ in $O(\min(\sqrt{n C_0(f)},\sqrt{n C_1(f)}))$, where $C_0, C_1$ is the certificate complexity, and $n$ is the size of the input. We also derive a general form of the ad hoc weighted method used by Hoyer, Neerbek and Shi to give a quantum lower bound on ordered search and sorting.

<p><strong>13.    Silicon quantum computation based on magnetic dipolar coupling</strong><br>
Rogerio de Sousa, J. D. Delgado, S. Das Sarma<br>
Phys. Rev. A 70, 052304 (2004).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0311403">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0311403</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A dipolar gate alternative to the exchange gate based Kane quantum computer is proposed where the qubits are electron spins of shallow group V donors in silicon. Residual exchange coupling is treated as gate error amenable to quantum error correction, removing the stringent requirements on donor positioning characteristic of all silicon exchange-based implementations [B. Koiller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 027903 (2002)]. Contrary to common speculation, such a scheme is scalable with no overhead in gating time even though it is based on long-range dipolar inter-qubit coupling.

<p><strong>14.    Quantum m-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer</strong><br>
Zhide Chen, Hong Zhu<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0311039">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0311039</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the m-out-of-n oblivious transfer (OT) model, one party Alice sends n bits to another party Bob, Bob can get only m bits from the n bits. However, Alice cannot know which m bits Bob received. Y.Mu[MJV02]} and Naor[Naor01] presented classical m-out-of-n oblivious transfer based on discrete logarithm. As the work of Shor [Shor94], the discrete logarithm can be solved in polynomial time by quantum computers, so such OTs are unsafe to the quantum computer. In this paper, we construct a quantum m-out-of-n OT (QOT) scheme based on the transmission of polarized light and show that the scheme is robust to general attacks, i.e. the QOT scheme satisfies statistical correctness and statistical privacy.
