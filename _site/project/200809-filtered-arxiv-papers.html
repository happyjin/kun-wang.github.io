    <p><strong>1.    Quantum random walks without walking</strong><br>
K Manouchehri, J.B. Wang<br>
K. Manouchehri and J. B. Wang, Phys. Rev. A 80, 060304(R) (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0034">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0034</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks have received much interest due to their non-intuitive dynamics, which may hold the key to a new generation of quantum algorithms. What remains a major challenge is a physical realization that is experimentally viable and not limited to special connectivity criteria. We present a scheme for walking on arbitrarily complex graphs, which can be realized using a variety of quantum systems such as a BEC trapped inside an optical lattice. This scheme is particularly elegant since the walker is not required to physically step between the nodes; only flipping coins is sufficient.

<p><strong>3.    Nondeterministic Noiseless Linear Amplification of Quantum Systems</strong><br>
T.C.Ralph, A.P.Lund<br>
Quantum Communication Measurement and Computing Proceedings of 9th International Conference, Ed. A.Lvovsky, 155-160 (AIP, New York 2009).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0326">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0326</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the concept of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. We propose a linear optical realization of this transformation that could be built with current technology. We discuss two applications; ideal probabilistic cloning of coherent states and distillation of continuous variable entanglement. For the latter example we demonstrate that highly pure entanglement can be distilled from transmission over a lossy channel.

<p><strong>4.    Analysis and synthesis of attractive quantum Markovian dynamics</strong><br>
Francesco Ticozzi, Lorenza Viola<br>
Automatica 45: 2002-2009 , 2009<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0613">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0613</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a general framework for investigating a large class of stabilization problems in Markovian quantum systems. Building on the notions of invariant and attractive quantum subsystem, we characterize attractive subspaces by exploring the structure of the invariant sets for the dynamics. Our general analysis results are exploited to assess the ability of open-loop Hamiltonian and output-feedback control strategies to synthesize Markovian generators which stabilize a target subsystem, subspace, or pure-state. In particular, we provide an algebraic characterization of the manifold of stabilizable pure states in arbitrary finite-dimensional Markovian systems, that leads to a constructive strategy for designing the relevant controllers. Implications for stabilization of entangled pure states are addressed by example.

<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically study bipartite entanglement purification with neutral atoms via cavity-assistant interaction and linear optical elements. We focus on entanglement distillation and the recurrence protocol, whose performances under idealized and realistic conditions are discussed. The implementation of these purification protocols has been tested with numerical simulations. We analyze the performance and stability of all required operations and emphasize that all techniques are feasible with current experimental technology.

<p><strong>6.    Correlation effects in a discrete quantum random walk</strong><br>
J. B. Stang, A. T. Rezakhani, B. C. Sanders<br>
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 175304 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0940">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0940</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce history-dependent discrete-time quantum random walk models by adding uncorrelated memory terms and also by modifying Hamiltonian of the walker to include couplings with memory-keeping agents. We next numerically study the correlation effects in these models. We also propose a correlation exponent as a relevant and promising tool for investigation of correlation or memory (hence non-Markovian) effects. Our analysis can easily be applied to more realistic models in which different regimes may emerge because of competition between different underlying physical mechanisms.

<p><strong>7.    Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann Reduction Approach to Multi-Photon Scattering in Coupled-Resonator Arrays</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1279">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1279</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum field theoretical approach based on the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction for the multi-photon scattering process in a nano-architecture consisting of the coupled resonator arrays (CRA), which are also coupled to some artificial atoms as the controlling quantum node. By making use of this approach, we find the bound states of single photon for an elementary unit, the T-type CRA, and explicitly obtain its multi-photon scattering S-matrix in various situations. We also use this method to calculate the multi-photon S-matrices for the more complex quantum network constructed with main T-type CRA&#39;s, such as a H-type CRA waveguide.

V. Nebendahl, H. Haffner, C. F. Roos<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Optimal control techniques are applied for the decomposition of unitary quantum operations into a sequence of single-qubit gates and entangling operations. To this end, we modify a gradient-ascent algorithm developed for systems of coupled nuclear spins in molecules to make it suitable for trapped ion quantum computing. We decompose unitary operations into entangling gates that are based on a nonlinear collective spin operator and complemented by global spinflip and local light shift gates. Among others, we provide explicit decompositions of controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates, and a simple quantum error correction protocol.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1501">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1501</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a large class of non-Markovian master equations that describe the dynamics of open quantum systems featuring strong memory effects, which relies on a quantum generalization of the concept of classical semi-Markov processes. General conditions for the complete positivity of the corresponding quantum dynamical maps are formulated. The resulting non-Markovian quantum processes allow the treatment of a variety of physical systems, as is illustrated by means of various examples and applications, including quantum optical systems and models of quantum transport.

<p><strong>10.    Transferring and bounding single photon in waveguide controlled by quantum node based on atomic ensemble</strong><br>
Jing Lu, H. Dong, Le-Man Kuang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1540">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1540</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the scattering process of photons confined in a one dimensional optical waveguide by a laser controlled atomic ensemble. The investigation leads to an alternative setup of quantum node controlling the coherent transfer of single photon in such one dimensional continuum. To exactly solve the effective scattering equations by using the discrete coordinate approach, we simulate the linear waveguide as a coupled resonator array at the high energy limit. We generally calculate the transmission coefficients and its vanishing at resonace reflects the good controllability of our scheme. We also show that there exist two bound states to describe the localize photons around the cavity.

Dynamical aspects of quantum Brownian motion in a low temperature environment are investigated. We give a systematic calculation of quantum entanglement among two Brownian oscillators without invoking Born-Markov approximation widely used for the study of open systems. Our approach is suitable to probe short time dynamics at cold temperatures where many experiments on quantum information processing are performed.

Matthew Pysher, Russell Bloomer, Olivier Pfister, Christopher M. Kaleva, Tony D. Roberts, Philip Battle<br>
Optics Letters, 34, 256 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1611">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1611</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We generated -2.2 dB of broadband amplitude squeezing at 1064 nm in a periodically poled KTiOPO_4 (PPKTP) waveguide, by coupling of the fundamental and second harmonic continuous-wave fields. This is the largest amount of squeezing obtained to date in a KTP waveguide, limited by propagation losses. This result paves the way for further improvements by use of lower-loss buried ion-exchanged waveguides.

<p><strong>13.    Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle for simultaneous measurement of positive-operator-valued measures</strong><br>
Takayuki Miyadera, Hideki Imai<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 052119 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1714">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1714</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A limitation on simultaneous measurement of two arbitrary positive operator valued measures is discussed. In general, simultaneous measurement of two noncommutative observables is only approximately possible. Following Werner&#39;s formulation, we introduce a distance between observables to quantify an accuracy of measurement. We derive an inequality that relates the achievable accuracy with noncommutativity between two observables. As a byproduct a necessary condition for two positive operator valued measures to be simultaneously measurable is obtained.

<p>
We propose a potentially practical scheme for realization of an n-qubit (n&gt;2) conditional phase flip (CPF) gate and implementation of Grover search algorithm in the ion-trap system. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that, our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find a marked state with high fidelity and high success probability. We also show the merits of the proposal that the increase of the ion number can improve the fidelity and the success probability of the CPF gate. The required operations for Grover search are very close to the capabilities of current ion-trap techniques.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the undetermined sets consisting of two-level, multi-partite pure quantum states, whose reduced density matrices give absolutely no information of their original states. Two approached of finding these quantum states are proposed. One is to establish the relation between codewords of the stabilizer quantum error correction codes (SQECCs) and the undetermined states. The other is to study the local complementation rules of the graph states. As an application, the undetermined states can be exploited in the quantum secret sharing scheme. The security is guaranteed by their undetermineness.

We propose a scheme for linear optical quantum Fredkin gate based on the combination of recently experimentally demonstrated linear optical partial SWAP gate and controlled-Z gates. Both heralded gate and simplified postselected gate operating in the coincidence basis are designed. The suggested setups have a simple structure and require stabilization of only a single Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of the postselected Fredkin gate appears to be feasible and within the reach of current technology.

<p>
This study considers implementations of error correction in a simulation language on a classical computer. Error correction will be necessarily in quantum computing and quantum information. We will give some examples of the implementations of some error correction codes. These implementations will be made in a more general quantum simulation language on a classical computer in the language Mathematica. The intention of this research is to develop a programming language that is able to make simulations of all quantum algorithms and error corrections in the same framework. The program code implemented on a classical computer will provide a connection between the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and computational methods. This gives us a clear uncomplicated language for the implementations of algorithms.

<p>
Recently W. J. Kim, M. Brown-Hayes, D. A. R. Dalvit, J. H. Brownell, and R. Onofrio [Phys. Rev. A, v.78, 036102(R) (2008)] performed electrostatic calibrations for a plane plate above a centimeter-size spherical lens at separations down to 20-30 nm and observed &quot;anomalous behavior&quot;. It was found that the gradient of the electrostatic force does not depend on separation as predicted on the basis of a pure Coulombian contribution. Some hypotheses which could potentially explain the deviation from the expected behavior were considered, and qualitative arguments in favor of the influence of patch surface potentials were presented. We demonstrate that for the large lenses at separations of a few tens nanometers from the plate, the electrostatic force law used by the authors is not applicable due to possible deviations of the mechanically polished and ground lens surface from a perfect spherical shape. A model is proposed which explains the observed &quot;anomalous behavior&quot; using the standard Coulombian force.

<blockquote>
<p>
Coherent manipulation of an increasing number of qubits for the generation of entangled states has been an important goal and benchmark in the emerging field of quantum information science. The multiparticle entangled states serve as physical resources for measurement-based quantum computing and high-precision quantum metrology. However, their experimental preparation has proved extremely challenging. To date, entangled states up to six, eight atoms, or six photonic qubits have been demonstrated. Here, by exploiting both the photons&#39; polarization and momentum degrees of freedom, we report the creation of hyper-entangled six-, eight-, and ten-qubit Schr\&quot;odinger cat states. We characterize the cat states by evaluating their fidelities and detecting the presence of genuine multi-partite entanglement. Small modifications of the experimental setup will allow the generation of various graph states up to ten qubits. Our method provides a shortcut to expand the effective Hilbert space, opening up interesting applications such as quantum-enhanced super-resolving phase measurement, graph-state generation for anyonic simulation and topological error correction, and novel tests of nonlocality with hyper-entanglement.

<p><strong>21.    Manipulating the quantum information of the radial modes of trapped ions: Linear phononics, entanglement generation, quantum state transmission and non-locality tests</strong><br>
A. Serafini, A. Retzker, M. B. Plenio<br>
New J. Phys. 11, 023007 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4287">http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4287</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed study on the possibility of manipulating quantum information encoded in the &quot;radial&quot; modes of arrays of trapped ions (i.e., in the ions&#39; oscillations orthogonal to the trap&#39;s main axis). In such systems, because of the tightness of transverse confinement, the radial modes pertaining to different ions can be addressed individually. In the first part of the paper we show that, if local control of the radial trapping frequencies is available, any linear optical and squeezing operation on the locally defined modes - on single as well as on many modes - can be reproduced by manipulating the frequencies. Then, we proceed to describe schemes apt to generate unprecedented degrees of bipartite and multipartite continuous variable entanglement under realistic noisy working conditions, and even restricting only to a global control of the trapping frequencies. Furthermore, we consider the transmission of the quantum information encoded in the radial modes along the array of ions, and show it to be possible to a remarkable degree of accuracy, for both finite-dimensional and continuous variable quantum states. Finally, as an application, we show that the states which can be generated in this setting allow for the violation of multipartite non-locality tests, by feasible displaced parity measurements. Such a demonstration would be a first test of quantum non-locality for &quot;massive&quot; degrees of freedom (i.e., for degrees of freedom describing the motion of massive particles).

<blockquote>
<p>
We have frozen the coherent evolution of a field in a cavity by repeated measurements of its photon number. We use circular Rydberg atoms dispersively coupled to the cavity mode for an absorption-free photon counting. These measurements inhibit the growth of a Field injected in the cavity by a classical source. This manifestation of the Quantum Zeno effect illustrates the back action of the photon number determination onto the Field phase. The residual growth of the Field can be seen as a random walk of its amplitude in the two-dimensional phase space. This experiment sheds light onto the measurement process and opens perspectives for active quantum feedback.

<p><strong>24.    Temperature measurements of a Bose--Einstein condensate by ultra--intense light pulses</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Experimentally the temperature in a Bose--Einstein condensate is always deduced resorting to the comparison between the Maxwell--Boltzmann velocity distribution function and the density profile in momentum space. Though a successful method it is an approximation, since it also implies the use of classical statistical mechanics at temperatures close to the condensation temperature where quantal effects play a relevant role. The present work puts forward a new method in which we use an ultra--intense light pulse and a nonlinear optical material as detectors for differences in times--of--flight. This experimental value shall be compared against the result here calculated, using the Bose--Einstein distribution function, which is a temperature--dependent variable, and in this way the temperature of the condensate is obtained.
