    <p><strong>1.    Efficient polarization entanglement purification based on parametric down-conversion sources with cross-Kerr nonlinearity</strong><br>
Yu-Bo Sheng, Fu-Guo Deng, Hong-Yu Zhou<br>
Phys. Rev. A 77, 042308 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0032">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0032</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a way for entanglement purification based on two parametric down-conversion (PDC) sources with cross-Kerr nonlinearities. It is comprised of two processes. The first one is a primary entanglement purification protocol for PDC sources with nondestructive quantum nondemolition (QND) detectors by transferring the spatial entanglement of photon pairs to their polarization. In this time, the QND detectors act as the role of controlled-not (CNot) gates. Also they can distinguish the photon number of the spatial modes, which provides a good way for the next process to purify the entanglement of the photon pairs kept more. In the second process for entanglement purification, new QND detectors are designed to act as the role of CNot gates. This protocol has the advantage of high yield and it requires neither CNot gates based on linear optical elements nor sophisticated single-photon detectors, which makes it more convenient in practical applications.

<p><strong>2.    On statements of experimental results expressed in the mathematical language of quantum theory</strong><br>
John M. Myers, F. Hadi Madjid<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0130">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0130</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We note the separation of a quantum description of an experiment into a statement of results (as probabilities) and an explanation of these results (in terms of linear operators). The inverse problem of choosing an explanation to fit given results is analyzed, leading to the conclusion that any quantum description comes as an element of a family of related descriptions, entailing multiple statements of results and multiple explanations. Facing this multiplicity opens avenues for exploration and consequences that are only beginning to be explored. Among the consequences are these: (1) statements of results impose topologies on control parameters, without resort to any quantum explanation; (2) an endless source of distinct explanations forces an open cycle of exploration and description bringing more and more control parameters into play, and (3) ambiguity of description is essential to the concept of invariance in physics.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0561">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0561</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the appearance of non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of a bipartite system coupled to a reservoir, which can be described within a class of non-Markovian equations given by a generalized Lindblad structure. A novel master equation, which we term quantum Bloch-Boltzmann equation, is derived, describing both motional and internal states of a test particle in a quantum framework. When due to the preparation of the system or to decoherence effects one of the two degrees of freedom is amenable to a classical treatment and not resolved in the final measurement, though relevant for the interaction with the reservoir, non-Markovian behaviors such as stretched exponential or power law decay of coherences can be put into evidence.

<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate the interaction between one and two atoms and the field of a high-finesse optical resonator. Laser-cooled caesium atoms are transported into the cavity using an optical dipole trap. We monitor the interaction dynamics of a single atom strongly coupled to the resonator mode for several hundred milliseconds by observing the cavity transmission. Moreover, we investigate the position-dependent coupling of one and two atoms by shuttling them through the cavity mode. We demonstrate an alternative method, which suppresses heating effects, to analyze the atom-field interaction by retrieving the atom from the cavity and by measuring its final state.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum searches on highly symmetric graphs</strong><br>
Daniel Reitzner, Mark Hillery, Edgar Feldman, Vladimir Buzek<br>
Phys. Rev. A 79, 012323 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1237">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1237</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study scattering quantum walks on highly symmetric graphs and use the walks to solve search problems on these graphs. The particle making the walk resides on the edges of the graph, and at each time step scatters at the vertices. All of the vertices have the same scattering properties except for a subset of special vertices. The object of the search is to find a special vertex. A quantum circuit implementation of these walks is presented in which the set of special vertices is specified by a quantum oracle. We consider the complete graph, a complete bipartite graph, and an $M$-partite graph. In all cases, the dimension of the Hilbert space in which the time evolution of the walk takes place is small (between three and six), so the walks can be completely analyzed analytically. Such dimensional reduction is due to the fact that these graphs have large automorphism groups. We find the usual quadratic quantum speedups in all cases considered.

E. Ferraro, H.-P. Breuer, A. Napoli, M. A. Jivulescu, A. Messina<br>
Physical Review B 78, 064309 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1314">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1314</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply the time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique to the model of a central spin which is coupled to a spin bath via nonuniform Heisenberg interaction. The second-order results of the TCL method for the coherences and populations of the central spin are determined analytically and compared with numerical simulations of the full von Neumann equation of the total system. The TCL approach is found to yield an excellent approximation in the strong field regime for the description of both the short-time dynamics and the long time behavior.

<p><strong>7.    Recurrence properties of unbiased coined quantum walks on infinite $d$-dimensional lattices</strong><br>
Martin Stefanak, Tamas Kiss, Igor Jex<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 032306 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1322">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1322</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The P\&#39;olya number characterizes the recurrence of a random walk. We apply the generalization of this concept to quantum walks [M. \v{S}tefa\v{n}\&#39;ak, I. Jex and T. Kiss, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{100}, 020501 (2008)] which is based on a specific measurement scheme. The P\&#39;olya number of a quantum walk depends in general on the choice of the coin and the initial coin state, in contrast to classical random walks where the lattice dimension uniquely determines it. We analyze several examples to depict the variety of possible recurrence properties. First, we show that for the class of quantum walks driven by independent coins for all spatial dimensions, the P\&#39;olya number is independent of the initial conditions and the actual coin operators, thus resembling the property of the classical walks. We provide an analytical estimation of the P\&#39;olya number for this class of quantum walks. Second, we examine the 2-D Grover walk, which exhibits localisation and thus is recurrent, except for a particular initial state for which the walk is transient. We generalize the Grover walk to show that one can construct in arbitrary dimensions a quantum walk which is recurrent. This is in great contrast with the classical walks which are recurrent only for the dimensions $d=1,2$. Finally, we analyze the recurrence of the 2-D Fourier walk. This quantum walk is recurrent except for a two-dimensional subspace of the initial states. We provide an analytical formula of the P\&#39;olya number in its dependence on the initial state.

<p><strong>8.    Improved constructions of quantum automata</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Nikolajs Nahimovs<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1686">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1686</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a simple construction of quantum automata which achieve an exponential advantage over classical finite automata. Our automata use \frac{4}{\epsilon} \log 2p + O(1) states to recognize a language that requires p states classically. The construction is both substantially simpler and achieves a better constant in the front of \log p than the previously known construction of Ambainis and Freivalds (quant-ph/9802062). Similarly to Ambainis and Freivalds, our construction is by a probabilistic argument. We consider the possibility to derandomize it and present some results in this direction.

<p>
In this communication we report on a peculiar property of barrier transmission that systems governed by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation share with the linear one: For unit transmission the potential can be divided at an arbitrary point into two sub-potentials, a left and a right one, which have exactly the same transmission. This is a rare case of an exact property of a nonlinear wave function which will be of interest, e.g., for studies of coherent transport of Bose-Einstein condensates through mesoscopic waveguide

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2592">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2592</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We extend the concept of classicality in quantum optics to spin states. We call a state <code>classical&#39;&#39; if its density matrix can be decomposed as a weighted sum of angular momentum coherent states with positive weights. Classical spin states form a convex set C, which we fully characterize for a spin-1/2 and a spin-1. For arbitrary spin, we provide</code>non-classicality witnesses&#39;&#39;. For bipartite systems, C forms a subset of all separable states. A state of two spins-1/2 belongs to C if and only if it is separable, whereas for a spin-1/2 coupled to a spin-1, there are separable states which do not belong to C. We show that in general the question whether a state is in C can be answered by a linear programming algorithm.

<p><strong>13.    Environment-Assisted Quantum Walks in Photosynthetic Energy Transfer</strong><br>
Masoud Mohseni, Patrick Rebentrost, Seth Lloyd, Alán Aspuru-Guzik<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2741">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2741</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Energy transfer within photosynthetic systems can display quantum effects such as delocalized excitonic transport. Recently, direct evidence of long-lived coherence has been experimentally demonstrated for the dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex [Engel et al., Nature 446, 782 (2007)]. However, the relevance of quantum dynamical processes to the exciton transfer efficiency is to a large extent unknown. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the role of quantum interference effects in energy transfer dynamics of molecular arrays interacting with a thermal bath within the Lindblad formalism. To this end, we generalize continuous-time quantum walks to non-unitary and temperature-dependent dynamics in Liouville space derived from a microscopic Hamiltonian. Different physical effects of coherence and decoherence processes are explored via a universal measure for the energy transfer efficiency and its susceptibility. In particular, we demonstrate that for the FMO complex an effective interplay between free Hamiltonian and thermal fluctuations in the environment leads to a substantial increase in energy transfer efficiency from about 70% to 99%.

We provide a microscopic derivation for the non-Markovian master equation for an atom-cavity system with cavity losses and show that they can induce population trapping in the atomic excited state, when the environment outside the cavity has a non-flat spectrum.

<p><strong>15.    Intrinsic Cavity QED and Emergent Quasi-Normal Modes for Single Photon</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3085">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3085</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a special cavity design that is constructed by terminating a one-dimensional waveguide with a perfect mirror at one end and doping a two-level atom at the other. We show that this atom plays the intrinsic role of a semi-transparent mirror for single photon transports such that quasi-normal modes (QNM&#39;s) emerge spontaneously in the cavity system. This atomic mirror has its reflection coefficient tunable through its level spacing and its coupling to the cavity field, for which the cavity system can be regarded as a two-end resonator with a continuously tunable leakage. The overall investigation predicts the existence of quasi-bound states in the waveguide continuum. Solid state implementations based on a dc-SQUID circuit and a defected line resonator embedded in a photonic crystal are illustrated to show the experimental accessibility of the generic model.

<p><strong>16.    GHZ and W Entanglement Witnesses for the Non-interacting Fermi gas</strong><br>
Hessam Habibian, John W. Clark, Naeimeh Behbood, Kurt Hingerl<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3180">http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3180</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The existence and nature of tripartite entanglement of a noninteracting Fermi gas (NIFG) is investigated. Three new classes of parameterized entanglement witnesses (EWs) are introduced with the aim of detecting genuine tripartite entanglement in the three-body reduced density matrix and discriminating between the presence of the two types of genuine tripartite entanglement, W\B and GHZ\W. By choosing appropriate EW operators, the problem of finding GHZ and W EWs is reduced to linear programming. Specifically, we devise new W EWs based on a spin-chain model with periodic boundary conditions, and we construct a class of parametrized GHZ EWs by linearly combining projection operators corresponding to all the different state-vector types arising for a three-fermion system. A third class of EWs is provided by a GHZ stabilizer operator capable of distinguishing W\B from GHZ\B entanglement, which is not possible with $W$ EWs. Implementing these classes of EWs, it is found that all states containing genuine tripartite entanglement are of W type, and hence states containing GHZ\W genuine tripartite entanglement do not arise. Some genuine tripartite entangled states that have a positive partial transpose (PPT) with respect to some bipartition are detected. Finally, it is demonstrated that a NIFG does not exhibit &quot;pure&quot; W\B genuine tripartite entanglement: three-party entanglement without any separable or biseparable admixture does not occur.

<p>
We present time-resolved spontaneous emission measurements of single quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Quantum dots that couple to the photonic crystal waveguide are found to decay up to 27 times faster than uncoupled quantum dots. From these measurements $\beta$-factors of up to 0.89 are derived, and an unprecedented large bandwidth of 20 nm is demonstrated. This shows the promising potential of photonic crystal waveguides for efficient single-photon sources. The scaled frequency where the enhancement is observed is in excellent agreement with theory taking into account that the light-matter coupling is strongly enhanced due to the significant slow-down of light in the photonic crystal waveguide.

We calculate the linear optical properties of a high finesse cavity containing a thin dielectric membrane. We focus on the cavity&#39;s transmission, reflection, and finesse as a function of the membrane&#39;s position along the cavity axis and as a function of its optical loss. We compare these calculations with measurements and find excellent agreement in cavities with empty-cavity finesses in the range 10^4 to 10^5. The imaginary part of the membrane&#39;s index of refraction is found to be approximately 10^(-4). We calculate the laser cooling performance of this system, with a particular focus on the less-intuitive regime in which photons &quot;tunnel&quot; through the membrane on a time scale comparable to the membrane&#39;s period of oscillation. Lastly, we present calculations of quantum non-demolition measurements of the membrane&#39;s phonon number in the low signal-to-noise regime where the phonon lifetime is comparable to the QND readout time.

The overall time complexity of the SKW algorithm differs from the best achievable on a quantum computer only by a constant factor. We present improvements to the SKW algorithm which yield significant increase in success probability, and an improvement on query complexity such that the theoretical limit of a search algorithm succeeding with probability close to one is reached.

We develop dynamical programming methods for the purpose of optimal control of quantum states with convex constraints and concave cost and bequest functions of the quantum state. We consider both open loop and feedback control schemes, which correspond respectively to deterministic and stochastic Master Equation dynamics. For the quantum feedback control scheme with continuous non-demolition observations we exploit the separation theorem of filtering and control aspects for quantum stochastic dynamics to derive a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. If the control is restricted to only Hamiltonian terms this is equivalent to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an extra linear dissipative term. In this work, we consider, in particular, the case when control is restricted to only observation. A controlled qubit is considered as an example throughout the development of the formalism. Finally, we discuss optimum observation strategies to obtain a pure state from a mixed state of a quantum two-level system.
