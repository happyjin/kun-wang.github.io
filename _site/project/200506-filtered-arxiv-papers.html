    <p><strong>1.    An Algebra of Pure Quantum Programming</strong><br>
Thorsten Altenkirch, Jonathan Grattage, Juliana K. Vizzotto, Amr Sabry<br>
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 170, 6 March 2007, Pages 23-47<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506012">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506012</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We develop a sound and complete equational theory for the functional quantum programming language QML. The soundness and completeness of the theory are with respect to the previously-developed denotational semantics of QML. The completeness proof also gives rise to a normalisation algorithm following the normalisation by evaluation approach. The current work focuses on the pure fragment of QML omitting measurements.

<p><strong>2.    Operator Quantum Error Correcting Subsystems for Self-Correcting Quantum Memories</strong><br>
Dave Bacon<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73, 012340 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506023">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506023</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The most general method for encoding quantum information is not to encode the information into a subspace of a Hilbert space, but to encode information into a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Recently this notion has led to a more general notion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction. In standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a procedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any correctable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the correction procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead one must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not lead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery routines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present two examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are motivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices. In three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field theory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting. Such a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to noise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.

<p><strong>3.    Performance of various quantum key distribution systems using 1.55 um up-conversion single-photon detectors</strong><br>
Eleni Diamanti, Hiroki Takesue, Toshimori Honjo, Kyo Inoue, Yoshihisa Yamamoto<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506036">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506036</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare the performance of various quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using a novel single-photon detector, which combines frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide and a silicon avalanche photodiode (APD). The comparison is based on the secure communication rate as a function of distance for three QKD protocols: the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84), the Bennett, Brassard, and Mermin 1992 (BBM92), and the coherent differential phase shift keying (DPSK). We show that the up-conversion detector allows for higher communication rates and longer communication distances than the commonly used InGaAs/InP APD for all the three QKD protocols.

<p><strong>4.    Two-way quantum communication channels</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Debbie W. Leung, Hoi-Kwong Lo<br>
International Journal of Quantum Information, Vol. 4, No. 1 (2006) 63-83<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506039">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506039</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider communication between two parties using a bipartite quantum operation, which constitutes the most general quantum mechanical model of two-party communication. We primarily focus on the simultaneous forward and backward communication of classical messages. For the case in which the two parties share unlimited prior entanglement, we give inner and outer bounds on the achievable rate region that generalize classical results due to Shannon. In particular, using a protocol of Bennett, Harrow, Leung, and Smolin, we give a one-shot expression in terms of the Holevo information for the entanglement-assisted one-way capacity of a two-way quantum channel. As applications, we rederive two known additivity results for one-way channel capacities: the entanglement-assisted capacity of a general one-way channel, and the unassisted capacity of an entanglement-breaking one-way channel.

Hilary A. Carteret, Bruce Richmond, Nico Temme<br>
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 (2005) 8641-8665<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506048">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506048</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we complete the analysis begun by two of the authors in a previous work on the discrete quantum walk on the line [J. Phys. A 36:8775-8795 (2003) quant-ph/0303105 ]. We obtain uniformly convergent asymptotics for the &quot;exponential decay&#39;&#39; regions at the leading edges of the main peaks in the Schr{\&quot;o}dinger (or wave-mechanics) picture. This calculation required us to generalise the method of stationary phase and we describe this extension in some detail, including self-contained proofs of all the technical lemmas required. We also rigorously establish the exact Feynman equivalence between the path-integral and wave-mechanics representations for this system using some techniques from the theory of special functions. Taken together with the previous work, we can now prove every theorem by both routes.

In this paper we discuss analogue computers based on quantum optical systems accelerating dynamic programming for some computational problems. These computers, at least in principle, can be realized by actually existing devices.

<p><strong>7.    Modified Grover&#39;s Search Algorithm in O(M+logN)Steps</strong><br>
A. S. Gupta, A. Pathak<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506093">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506093</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The present letter proposes a modification in the well known Grover&#39;s search algorithm, which searches a database of $N$ unsorted items in $O(\sqrt{N/M})$ steps, where $M$ represents the number of solutions to the search problem. Concurrency control techniques and extra registers for marking and storing the solutions are used in the modified algorithm. This requires additional space but it is shown that the use of extra register and marking techniques can reduce the time complexity to $O(M+\log N)$.

<p><strong>8.    Continuous-time Quantum Walks on a Cycle Graph</strong><br>

We present analytical treatment of quantum walks on a cycle graph. The investigation is based on a realistic physical model of the graph in which decoherence is induced by continuous monitoring of each graph vertex with nearby quantum point contact. We derive the analytical expression of the probability distribution along the cycle. Upper bound estimate to mixing time is shown.

<p><strong>9.    Modified Grover&#39;s search algorithm for the cases where the number of solutions is known</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506105">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506105</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grover&#39;s search algorithm searches a database of $N$ unsorted items in $O(\sqrt{N/M})$ steps where $M$ represents the number of solutions to the search problem. This paper proposes a scheme for searching a database of $N$ unsorted items in $O(logN)$ steps, provided the value of $M$ is known. It is also shown that when $M$ is unknown but if we can estimate an upper bound of possible values of $M$, then an improvement in the time complexity of conventional Grover&#39;s algorithm is possible. In that case, the present scheme reduces the time complexity to $O(MlogN)$.

J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 7 S135 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506116">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506116</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum information offers the promise of being able to perform certain communication and computation tasks that cannot be done with conventional information technology (IT). Optical Quantum Information Processing (QIP) holds particular appeal, since it offers the prospect of communicating and computing with the same type of qubit. Linear optical techniques have been shown to be scalable, but the corresponding quantum computing circuits need many auxiliary resources. Here we present an alternative approach to optical QIP, based on the use of weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities and homodyne measurements. We show how this approach provides the fundamental building blocks for highly efficient non-absorbing single photon number resolving detectors, two qubit parity detectors, Bell state measurements and finally near deterministic control-not (CNOT) gates. These are essential QIP devices

We describe a technique that enables strong, coherent coupling between individual optical emitters and guided plasmon excitations in conducting nano-structures at optical frequencies. We show that under realistic conditions, optical emission can be almost entirely directed into the plasmon modes. As an example, we describe an application of this technique involving efficient generation of single photons on demand, in which the plasmon is efficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide.

<p><strong>12.    Comment on quant-ph/0506105: The modified Grover algorithm cannot speedup unsorted database search</strong><br>
Gui Lu Long<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506121">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506121</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a recent paper (quant-ph/0506105), A S Gupta, M. Gupta and A. Pathak proposed a modified Grover algorithm that would exponentially accelerate the unsorted database search problem if the number of marked items is known. If this were true, it would represent a major fundamental breakthrough in computer science, mathematics, quantum information and other related branches of sciences. However the algorithm is not valid. We will explain it in this brief comment.

<p><strong>13.    Numerical simulation of Bell inequality&#39;s violation using optical transverse modes in multimode waveguides</strong><br>
Jian Fu, Xun Zhang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506125">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506125</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We numerically demonstrate that &quot;mode-entangled states&quot; based on the transverse modes of classical optical fields in multimode waveguides violate Bell&#39;s inequality. Numerically simulating the correlation measurement scheme of Bell&#39;s inequality, we obtain the normalized correlation functions of the intensity fluctuations for the two entangled classical fields. By using the correlation functions, the maximum violations of Bell&#39;s inequality are obtained. This implies that the two classical fields in the mode-entangled states, although spatially separated, present a nonlocal correlation.

Austin G. Fowler<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506126">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506126</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis deals with a series of quantum computer implementation issues from the Kane 31P in 28Si architecture to Shor&#39;s integer factoring algorithm and beyond. The discussion begins with simulations of the adiabatic Kane CNOT and readout gates, followed by linear nearest neighbor implementations of 5-qubit quantum error correction with and without fast measurement. A linear nearest neighbor circuit implementing Shor&#39;s algorithm is presented, then modified to remove the need for exponentially small rotation gates. Finally, a method of constructing optimal approximations of arbitrary single-qubit fault-tolerant gates is described and applied to the specific case of the remaining rotation gates required by Shor&#39;s algorithm.

<p><strong>15.    Internal Consistency of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction in Light of Rigorous Derivations of the Quantum Markovian Limit</strong><br>
R. Alicki, D.A. Lidar, P. Zanardi<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73, 052311 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506201">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506201</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We critically examine the internal consistency of a set of minimal assumptions entering the theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction for Markovian noise. These assumptions are: fast gates, a constant supply of fresh and cold ancillas, and a Markovian bath. We point out that these assumptions may not be mutually consistent in light of rigorous formulations of the Markovian approximation. Namely, Markovian dynamics requires either the singular coupling limit (high temperature), or the weak coupling limit (weak system-bath interaction). The former is incompatible with the assumption of a constant and fresh supply of cold ancillas, while the latter is inconsistent with fast gates. We discuss ways to resolve these inconsistencies. As part of our discussion we derive, in the weak coupling limit, a new master equation for a system subject to periodic driving.

<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze a microscopic decoherence model in which the total system is described as a spin gas. A spin gas consists of N classically moving particles with additional, interacting quantum degrees of freedom (e.g. spins). For various multipartite entangled probe states, we analyze the decoherence induced by interactions between the probe- and environmental spins in such spin gases. We can treat mesoscopic environments (10^5 particles). We present results for a lattice gas, which could be realized by neutral atoms hopping in an optical lattice, and show the effects of non-Markovian and correlated noise, as well as finite size effects.

We construct a quantum random walk algorithm, based on the Dirac operator instead of the Laplacian. The algorithm explores multiple evolutionary branches by superposition of states, and does not require the coin toss instruction of classical randomised algorithms. We use this algorithm to search for a marked vertex on a hypercubic lattice in arbitrary dimensions. Our numerical and analytical results match the scaling behaviour of earlier algorithms that use a coin toss instruction.

<p><strong>18.    Non-Markov dynamics and phonon decoherence of a double quantum dot charge qubit</strong><br>
Xian-Ting Liang<br>
Physical Review B 72, 245328 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506258">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506258</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we investigate decoherence times of a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit due to it coupling with acoustic phonon baths. We individually consider the acoustic piezoelectric as well as deformation coupling phonon baths in the qubit environment. The decoherence times are calculated with two kinds of methods. One of them is based on the qusiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) and the other is based on Bloch equations, and two kinds of results are compared. It is shown that the theoretical decoherence times of the DQD charge qubit are shorter than the experimental reported results. It implies that the phonon couplings to the qubit play a subordinate role, resulting in the decoherence of the qubit.

<p><strong>19.    Relaxation of Pseudo pure states : The Role of Cross-Correlations</strong><br>
Arindam Ghosh, Anil Kumar<br>
Journal of Magnetic Resonance,173,125-133 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506259">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506259</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In Quantum Information Processing by NMR one of the major challenges is relaxation or decoherence. Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As these preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its equilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut off the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop alternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless Subsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States and analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes, known as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of others.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of testing the commutativity of a black-box group specified by its k generators. The complexity (in terms of k) of this problem was first considered by Pak, who gave a randomized algorithm involving O(k) group operations. We construct a quite optimal quantum algorithm for this problem whose complexity is in O (k^{2/3}). The algorithm uses and highlights the power of the quantization method of Szegedy. For the lower bound of Omega(k^{2/3}), we give a reduction from a special case of Element Distinctness to our problem. Along the way, we prove the optimality of the algorithm of Pak for the randomized model.

Dominik Janzing<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506270">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506270</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
What is the simplest Hamiltonian which can implement quantum computation without requiring any control operations during the computation process? In a previous paper we have constructed a 10-local finite-range interaction among qubits on a 2D lattice having this property. Here we show that pair-interactions among qutrits on a 2D lattice are sufficient, too, and can also implement an ergodic computer where the result can be read out from the time average state after some post-selection with high success probability. Two of the 3 qutrit states are given by the two levels of a spin-1/2 particle located at a specific lattice site, the third state is its absence. Usual hopping terms together with an attractive force among adjacent particles induce a coupled quantum walk where the particle spins are subjected to spatially inhomogeneous interactions implementing holonomic quantum computing. The holonomic method ensures that the implemented circuit does not depend on the time needed for the walk. Even though the implementation of the required type of spin-spin interactions is currently unclear, the model shows that quite simple Hamiltonians are powerful enough to allow for universal quantum computing in a closed physical system.

We identify an optical signature for detecting entanglement in experimental nanostructure systems comprising coupled excitonic qubits. This signature owes its strength to non-Markovian dynamical effects in the second-order temporal coherence function of the emitted radiation. We calculate autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions for both selective and collective light excitation, and prove that the coherence properties of the emitted light do indeed carry information about the entanglement of the initial multi-qubit state. We also show that this signature can survive in the presence of a noisy environment.

<p>
Fiber taper waveguides are used to improve the efficiency of room temperature photoluminescence measurements of AlGaAs microdisk resonant cavities with embedded self-assembled InAs quantum dots. As a near-field collection optic, the fiber taper improves the collection efficiency from microdisk lasers by a factor of ~ 15-100 times in comparison to conventional normal incidence free-space collection techniques. In addition, the fiber taper can serve as a efficient means for pumping these devices, and initial measurements employing fiber pumping and collection are presented. Implications of this work towards chip-based cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments are discussed.
