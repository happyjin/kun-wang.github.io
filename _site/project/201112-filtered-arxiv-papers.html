    <p><strong>1.    Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems: Stochastic Equations and their Perturbative Solutions</strong><br>
C. H. Fleming, B. L. Hu<br>
Annals of Physics 327 (2012), pp. 1238-1276<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0252">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0252</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We treat several key stochastic equations for non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics and present a formalism for finding solutions to them via canonical perturbation theory, without making the Born-Markov or rotating wave approximations (RWA). This includes master equations of the (asymptotically) stationary, periodic, and time-nonlocal type. We provide proofs on the validity and meaningfulness of the late-time perturbative master equation and on the preservation of complete positivity despite a general lack of Lindblad form. More specifically, we show how the algebraic generators satisfy the theorem of Lindblad and Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan, even though the dynamical generators do not. These proofs ensure the mathematical viability and physical soundness of solutions to non-Markovian processes. Within the same formalism we also expand upon known results for non-Markovian corrections to the quantum regression theorem. Several directions where these results can be usefully applied to are also described, including the analysis of near-resonant systems where the RWA is inapplicable and the calculation of the reduced equilibrium state of open systems.

<p><strong>2.    Dynamical Gaussian state transfer with quantum error correcting architecture</strong><br>
Go Tajimi, Naoki Yamamoto<br>
Physical Review A 85, 022303 (2012)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Transferring a quantum state of a light field to a memory is of particular importance. However, this transfer is usually hampered because the memory system is subjected to some noise and this can limit the performance of the state transfer to a great extent. In this paper, we consider the transfer of a Gaussian state of light to a linear medium memory such as an opto-mechanical oscillator and propose a dynamical feedback controller that suppresses the noise in the memory system. To protect an unknown state, the feedback scheme employs the specific configuration of the quantum error correction; that is, a three-mode Gaussian state having appropriate syndromes is taken as the input. Correspondingly, the memory consists of three independent linear systems. The syndrome errors are estimated continuously in time through the measurement of the output field, and the results are then fed back to control the system. Because the input is Gaussian and the systems are all linear, it is possible to formulate the problem using the framework of the celebrated classical Kalman filtering and linear quadratic Gaussian control. A numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the control scheme.

<p><strong>3.    The quantum query complexity of read-many formulas</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Shelby Kimmel, Robin Kothari<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science 7501, pp. 337-348 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0548">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0548</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum query complexity of evaluating any read-once formula with n black-box input bits is Theta(sqrt(n)). However, the corresponding problem for read-many formulas (i.e., formulas in which the inputs have fanout) is not well understood. Although the optimal read-once formula evaluation algorithm can be applied to any formula, it can be suboptimal if the inputs have large fanout. We give an algorithm for evaluating any formula with n inputs, size S, and G gates using O(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) quantum queries. Furthermore, we show that this algorithm is optimal, since for any n,S,G there exists a formula with n inputs, size at most S, and at most G gates that requires Omega(min{n, sqrt{S}, n^{1/2} G^{1/4}}) queries. We also show that the algorithm remains nearly optimal for circuits of any particular depth k &gt;= 3, and we give a linear-size circuit of depth 2 that requires Omega (n^{5/9}) queries. Applications of these results include a Omega (n^{19/18}) lower bound for Boolean matrix product verification, a nearly tight characterization of the quantum query complexity of evaluating constant-depth circuits with bounded fanout, new formula gate count lower bounds for several functions including PARITY, and a construction of an AC^0 circuit of linear size that can only be evaluated by a formula with Omega(n^{2-epsilon}) gates.

<p><strong>5.    Fourier Optics and Time Evolution of De Broglie Wave Packets</strong><br>
Giorgio Dillon<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1242">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1242</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that, under the condition of validity of the Fresnel approximation, diffraction and interference for a wave traveling in the z-direction may be described in terms of the spreading in time of the transverse (x,y)-wave packet. The time required for the evolved wave packet to yield identical patterns as given by standard optics corresponds to the time for the quantum to cross the optical apparatus. This point of view may provide interesting cues in wave mechanics and quantum physics education.

<p>
We calculate the one- and two-photon scattering matrices of a pair of collocated non-identical two-level atoms coupled to a waveguide. We show that by proper choice of a two-photon input, the background fluorescence by the atoms may be completely quenched, as a result of quantum interference, and that when the atoms&#39; detuning is smaller than their linewidths, extremely narrow fluorescence features emerge. Furthermore, the system emits a two-photon bound state which can display spatial oscillations/quantum beats, and can be tuned from bunched to anti-bunched statistics as the total photon energy is varied.

<p><strong>8.    Two quantum walkers sharing coins</strong><br>

Physical Review A 85, 022307 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1487">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1487</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider two independent quantum walks on separate lines augmented by partial or full swapping of coins after each step. For classical random walks, swapping or not swapping coins makes little difference to the random walk characteristics, but we show that quantum walks with partial swapping of coins have complicated yet elegant inter-walker correlations. Specifically we study the joint position distribution of the reduced two-walker state after tracing out the coins and analyze total, classical and quantum correlations in terms of the mutual information, the quantum mutual information, and the measurement-induced disturbance. Our analysis shows intriguing quantum features without classical analogues.

<p><strong>9.    Topological phenomena in quantum walks; elementary introduction to the physics of topological phases</strong><br>
Takuya Kitagawa<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1882">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1882</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Discrete quantum walks are dynamical protocols for controlling a single quantum particle. Despite of its simplicity, quantum walks display rich topological phenomena and provide one of the simplest systems to study and understand topological phases. In this article, we review the physics of discrete quantum walks in one and two dimensions in light of topological phenomena and provide elementary explanations of topological phases and their physical consequence, namely the existence of boundary states. We demonstrate that quantum walks are versatile systems that simulate many topological phases whose classifications are known for static Hamiltonians. Furthermore, topological phenomena appearing in quantum walks go beyond what has been known in static systems; there are phenomena unique to quantum walks, being an example of periodically driven systems, that do not exist in static systems. Thus the quantum walks not only provide a powerful tool as a quantum simulator for static topological phases but also give unique opportunity to study topological phenomena in driven systems.

We report the experimental demonstration of four-photon quantum interference using telecom-wavelength photons. Realization of multi-photon quantum interference is essential to linear optics quantum information processing and measurement-based quantum computing. We have developed a source that efficiently emits photon pairs in a pure spectrotemporal mode at a telecom wavelength region, and have demonstrated the quantum interference exhibiting the reduced fringe intervals that correspond to the reduced de Broglie wavelength of up to the four photon `NOON&#39; state. Our result should open a path to practical quantum information processing using telecom-wavelength photons.

<p><strong>11.    Markovian evolution of classical and quantum correlations in transverse-field XY model</strong><br>
Amit Kumar Pal, Indrani Bose<br>
Eur. Phys. J. B, Volume 85, Number 8, 277 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2050">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2050</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The transverse-field XY model in one dimension is a well-known spin model for which the ground state properties and excitation spectrum are known exactly. The model has an interesting phase diagram describing quantum phase transitions (QPTs) belonging to two different universality classes. These are the transverse-field Ising model and the XX model universality classes with both the models being special cases of the transverse-field XY model. In recent years, quantities related to quantum information theoretic measures like entanglement, quantum discord (QD) and fidelity have been shown to provide signatures of QPTs. Another interesting issue is that of decoherence to which a quantum system is subjected due to its interaction, represented by a quantum channel, with an environment. In this paper, we determine the dynamics of different types of correlations present in a quantum system, namely, the mutual information, the classical correlations and the quantum correlations, as measured by the quantum discord, in a two-qubit state. The density matrix of this state is given by the nearest-neighbour reduced density matrix obtained from the ground state of the transverse-field XY model in 1d. We assume Markovian dynamics for the time-evolution due to system-environment interactions. The quantum channels considered include the bit-flip, bit-phase-flip and phase-flip channels. Two different types of dynamics are identified for the channels in one of which the quantum correlations are greater in magnitude than the classical correlations in a finite time interval. The origins of the different types of dynamics are further explained. For the different channels, appropriate quantities associated with the dynamics of the correlations are identified which provide signatures of QPTs. We also report results for further-neighbour two-qubit states and finite temperatures.

<p><strong>13.    Lifshitz formula by spectral summation method</strong><br>
V. V. Nesterenko, I. G. Pirozhenko<br>
Physical Review A 86, 052503 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2599">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2599</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Lifshitz formula is derived by making use of the spectral summation method which is a mathematically rigorous simultaneous application of both the mode-by-mode summation technique and scattering formalism. The contributions to the Casimir energy of electromagnetic excitations of different types (surface modes, waveguide modes, and photonic modes) are clearly retraced. A correct transition to imaginary frequencies is accomplished with allowance for all the peculiarities of the frequency equations and pertinent scattering data in the complex $\omega $ plane, including, in particular, the cuts connecting the branch points and complex roots of the frequency equations (quasi-normal modes). The principal novelty of our approach is a special choice of appropriate passes in the contour integrals, which are used for transition to imaginary frequencies. As a result, the long standing problem of cuts in the complex $\omega $ plane is solved completely. Inconsistencies of some previous derivations of the Lifshitz formula are traced briefly. For completeness of the presentation, the necessary mathematical facts are also stated, namely, solution of the Maxwell equations for configurations under consideration, scattering formalism for parallel plane interfaces, determination of the frequency equation roots, and others.

In this work a Green function approach for scattering quantum walks is developed. The exact formula has the form of a sum over paths and always can be cast into a closed analytic expression for arbitrary topologies and position dependent quantum amplitudes. By introducing the step and path operators, it is shown how to extract any information about the system from the Green function. The method relevant features are demonstrated by discussing in details an example, a general diamond-shaped graph.

Phys. Rev. A 85, 062318 (2012)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2641">http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2641</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present strictly efficient schemes for scalable measurement-based quantum computing using continuous-variable systems: These schemes are based on suitable non-Gaussian resource states, ones that can be prepared using interactions of light with matter systems or even purely optically. Merely Gaussian measurements such as optical homodyning as well as photon counting measurements are required, on individual sites. These schemes overcome limitations posed by Gaussian cluster states, which are known not to be universal for quantum computations of unbounded length, unless one is willing to scale the degree of squeezing with the total system size. We establish a framework derived from tensor networks and matrix product states with infinite physical dimension and finite auxiliary dimension general enough to provide a framework for such schemes. Since in the discussed schemes the logical encoding is finite-dimensional, tools of error correction are applicable. We also identify some further limitations for any continuous-variable computing scheme from which one can argue that no substantially easier ways of continuous-variable measurement-based computing than the presented one can exist.

<blockquote>
<p>
We extend the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation to open quantum systems which exhibit multi-channel coupling to a harmonic oscillator reservoir. Open quantum systems which have multi-channel reservoir coupling are those in which canonical transformation of reservoir modes cannot reduce the number of reservoir operators appearing in the interaction Hamiltonian to one. We show that the non-Markovian QSD equation for multi-channel reservoir coupling can, in some cases, lead to an exact master equation which we derive. We then derive the exact master equation for the three-level system in a vee-type configuration which has multi-channel reservoir coupling and give the analytical solution. Finally, we examine the evolution of the three-level vee-type system with generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck reservoir correlations numerically.

Implications of these results on energy transfer in biological light harvesting systems, and the role of quantum coherences and entanglement are discussed.

<p><strong>18.    Some Languages Recognized by Two-Way Finite Automata with Quantum and Classical States</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
{\it Two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states} (2QCFA) were introduced by Ambainis and Watrous, and it was shown that 2QCFA have superiority over {\it two-way probabilistic finite automata} (2PFA) for recognizing some non-regular languages such as the language $L_{eq}={a^{n}b^{n}\mid n\in \mathbf{N}}$ and the palindrome language $L_{pal}={\omega\in {a,b}^<em>\mid\omega=\omega^R}$, where $x^R$ is $x$ in the reverse order. It is interesting to find more languages like these that witness the superiority of 2QCFA over 2PFA. In this paper, we consider the language $L_{m}={xcy\mid \Sigma={a, b, c}, x,y\in{a,b}^{</em>},c\in\Sigma, |x|=|y|}$ that is similar to the middle language $L_{middle}={xay\mid x,y\in\Sigma^{*},a\in\Sigma, |x|=|y|}$. We prove that the language $L_{m}$ can be recognized by 2QCFA with one-sided error in polynomial expected time. Also, we show that $L_{m}$ can be recognized by 2PFA with bounded error, but only in exponential expected time. Thus $L_{m}$ is another witness of the fact that 2QCFA are more powerful than their classical counterparts.

<blockquote>
<p>
Non-local games are studied in quantum information because they provide a simple way for proving the difference between the classical world and the quantum world. A non-local game is a cooperative game played by 2 or more players against a referee. The players cannot communicate but may share common random bits or a common quantum state. A referee sends an input $x_i$ to the $i^{th}$ player who then responds by sending an answer $a_i$ to the referee. The players win if the answers $a_i$ satisfy a condition that may depend on the inputs $x_i$. Typically, non-local games are studied in a framework where the referee picks the inputs from a known probability distribution. We initiate the study of non-local games in a worst-case scenario when the referee&#39;s probability distribution is unknown and study several non-local games in this scenario.

<blockquote>
<p>
A big open question in the quantum information theory concerns feasibility of a self-correcting quantum memory. A quantum state recorded in such memory can be stored reliably for a macroscopic time without need for active error correction if the memory is put in contact with a cold enough thermal bath. In this paper we derive a rigorous lower bound on the memory time $T_{mem}$ of the 3D Cubic Code model which was recently conjectured to have a self-correcting behavior. Assuming that dynamics of the memory system can be described by a Markovian master equation of Davies form, we prove that $T_{mem}\ge L^{c\beta}$ for some constant $c&gt;0$, where $L$ is the lattice size and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature of the bath. However, this bound applies only if the lattice size does not exceed certain critical value $L^*\sim e^{\beta/3}$. We also report a numerical Monte Carlo simulation of the studied memory indicating that our analytic bounds on $T_{mem}$ are tight up to constant coefficients. In order to model the readout step we introduce a new decoding algorithm which might be of independent interest. Our decoder can be implemented efficiently for any topological stabilizer code and has a constant error threshold under random uncorrelated errors.

<p>
We define irreducible N-body spectral functions and Casimir energies and consider a massless scalar quantum field interacting locally by positive potentials with classical objects. Irreducible N-body spectral functions in this case are shown to be conditional probabilities of random walks. The corresponding irreducible contributions to scalar many-body Casimir energies are finite and positive/negative for an odd/even number of objects. The force between any two finite objects separable by a plane is always attractive in this case. Analytical and numerical world-line results for the irreducible four-body Casimir energy of a scalar with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a tic-tac-toe pattern of lines are presented. Numerical results for the irreducible three-body Casimir energy of a massless scalar satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on three intersecting lines forming an isosceles triangle are also reported. In both cases the symmetric configuration (square and isosceles triangle) corresponds to the minimal irreducible contribution to the Casimir energy.

Information and correlations in a quantum system are closely related through the process of measurement. We explore such relation in a many-body quantum setting, effectively bridging between quantum metrology and condensed matter physics. To this aim we adopt the information-theory view of correlations, and study the amount of correlations after certain classes of Positive-Operator-Valued Measurements are locally performed. As many-body system we consider a one-dimensional array of interacting two-level systems (a spin chain) at zero temperature, where quantum effects are most pronounced. We demonstrate how the optimal strategy to extract the correlations depends on the quantum phase through a subtle interplay between local interactions and coherence.

The algorithm of Ambainis, Kempe, Rivosh (quant-ph/0402107) takes O(\sqrt{N log N}) steps and finds a marked location with probability O(1/log N) for grid of size \sqrt{N} * \sqrt{N}. This probability is small, thus amplitude amplification is needed to achieve \Theta(1) success probability. The amplitude amplification adds an additional O(\sqrt{log N}) factor to the number of steps, making it O(\sqrt{N} log N). In this paper, we show that despite a small probability to find a marked location, the probability to be within an O(\sqrt{N}) neighbourhood (at an O(\sqrt[4]{N}) distance) of the marked location is \Theta(1). This allows to skip amplitude amplification step and leads to an O(\sqrt{log N}) speed-up. We describe the results of numerical experiments supporting this idea, and we prove this fact analytically.

<p>
The behavior displayed by a quantum system when it is perturbed by a series of von Neumann measurements along time is analyzed. Because of the similarity between this general process with giving a deck of playing cards a shuffle, here it is referred to as quantum shuffling, showing that the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects emerge naturally as two time limits. Within this framework, a connection between the gradual transition from anti-Zeno to Zeno behavior and the appearance of an underlying Markovian dynamics is found. Accordingly, although a priori it might result counterintuitive, the quantum Zeno effect corresponds to a dynamical regime where any trace of knowledge on how the unperturbed system should evolve initially is wiped out (very rapid shuffling). This would explain why the system apparently does not evolve or decay for a relatively long time, although it eventually undergoes an exponential decay. By means of a simple working model, conditions characterizing the shuffling dynamics have been determined, which can be of help to understand and to devise quantum control mechanisms in a number of processes from the atomic, molecular and optical physics.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the quantum Levy walk to study transport and decoherence in a quantum random model. We have derived from second order perturbation theory the quantum master equation for a \textit{Levy-like particle}that moves along a lattice through hopping scale-free while interacting with a thermal bath of oscillators. The general evolution of the quantum Levy particle has been solved for different preparations of the system. We examine the evolution of the quantum purity, the localized correlation, and the probability to be in a lattice site, all them leading to important conclusions concerning quantum irreversibility and decoherence features. We prove that the quantum thermal mean-square displacement is finite under a constraint that is different when compared to the classical Weierstrass random walk. We prove that when the mean-square displacement is infinite the density of state has a complex null-set inside the Brillouin zone. We show the existence of a critical behavior in the continuous eigenenergy which is related to its non-differentiability and self-affine characteristics. In general our approach allows to study analytically quantum fluctuations and decoherence in a long-range hopping model.

The probability distributions of discrete-time quantum walks have been often investigated, and many interesting properties of them have been discovered. The probability that the walker can be find at a position is defined by diagonal elements of the density matrix.

<p>
We investigate the effects of disorder on single particle time-evolution and two-particle correlations in an array of evanescently coupled waveguides with position-dependent tunneling rates. In the clean limit, the energy spectrum of such an array is widely tunable. In the presence of a Hermitian on-site or tunneling disorder, we find that the localization of a wave packet is highly sensitive to this energy spectrum. In particular, for an input confined to a single waveguide, we show that the fraction of light localized to the original waveguide depends on the tunneling profile. We compare the two-particle intensity correlations in the presence of Hermitian, tunneling disorder and non-Hermitian, parity-and-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric, on-site potential disorder. We show the two-particle correlation function in both cases is qualitatively similar, since both disorders preserve the particle-hole symmetric nature of the energy spectrum.

We study experimentally and theoretically a dense ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a high $Q$ superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity mode at low temperature. The nitrogen-vacancy centers are modeled as effective spin one defects with inhomogeneous frequency distribution. For a large enough ensemble the effective magnetic coupling of the collective spin dominates the mode losses and inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble and the system exhibits well resolved normal mode splitting in probe transmission spectra. We use several theoretical approaches to model the probe spectra and the number and frequency distribution of the spins. This analysis reveals an only slowly temperature dependent q-Gaussian energy distribution of the defects with a yet unexplained decrease of effectively coupled spins at very low temperatures below $\unit{100}{\milli\kelvin}$. Based on the system parameters we predict the possibility to implement an extremely stable maser by adding an external pump to the system.

We study a quantum walk (QW) whose time evolution is induced by a random walk (RW) first introduced by Szegedy (2004). We focus on a relation between recurrent properties of the RW and localization of the corresponding QW. We find the following two fundamental derivations of localization of the QW. The first one is the set of all the $\ell^2$ summable eigenvectors of the corresponding RW. The second one is the orthogonal complement, whose eigenvalues are $\pm 1$, of the subspace induced by the RW. In particular, as a consequence, for an infinite half line, we show that localization of the QW can be ensured by the positive recurrence of the corresponding RWs, and also that the existence of only one self loop affects localization properties.

We achieve fidelities of up to F = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.01 with respect to the maximally entangled Bell state \phi+ using a low pump power of 5.3mW with a success rate of 3.2 four-fold detections per second. By increasing the pump power we find that success rates of up to 111.6 four-folds per second can be achieved, with entanglement still present in the fused state. We characterize the fusion operation by providing a full quantum process reconstruction. Here a model is developed to describe the generation of entanglement, including the main causes of imperfection, and we show that this model fits well with the experimental results. Our work shows how non-ideal settings limit the success of the fusion, providing useful information about the practical requirements for an operation that may be used to build large entangled states in bulk and on-chip quantum photonic waveguides.

We demonstrate that by engineering the relevant parameters that define the quality of light confinement, i.e. the light localization length and the loss length, strong coupling between a single quantum dot and an Anderson-localized cavity is within experimental reach. As a consequence of disorder-induced light confinement provides a novel platform for quantum electrodynamics experiments.

The quantum query complexity of Boolean matrix multiplication is typically studied as a function of the matrix dimension, n, as well as the number of 1s in the output, \ell. We prove an upper bound of O (n\sqrt{\ell}) for all values of \ell. This is an improvement over previous algorithms for all values of \ell. On the other hand, we show that for any \eps &lt; 1 and any \ell &lt;= \eps n^2, there is an \Omega(n\sqrt{\ell}) lower bound for this problem, showing that our algorithm is essentially tight. We first reduce Boolean matrix multiplication to several instances of graph collision. We then provide an algorithm that takes advantage of the fact that the underlying graph in all of our instances is very dense to find all graph collisions efficiently.

<blockquote>
<p>
The cross-Kerr nonlinearity (XKNL) effect can induce efficient photon interactions in principle with which photonic multiqubit gates can be performed using far fewer physical resources than linear optical schemes. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to generate giant cross-Kerr nonlinearities. In recent years, much effort has been made to perform multiqubit gates via weak XKNLs. However, the required nonlinearity strengths are still difficult to achieve in the experiment. We here propose an XKNL-based scheme for realizing a two-photon polarization-parity gate, a universal two-qubit gate, in which the required strength of the nonlinearity could be orders of magnitude weaker than those required for previous schemes. The scheme utilizes a ring cavity fed by a coherent state as a quantum information bus which interacts with a path mode of the two polarized photons (qubits). The XKNL effect makes the bus pick up a phase shift dependent on the photon number of the path mode. Even when the potential phase shifts are very small they can be effectively measured using photon-number resolving detectors, which accounts for the fact that our scheme can work in the regime of tiny XKNL. The measurement outcome reveals the parity (even parity or odd parity) of the two polarization qubits.

We evidence how the phenomenon is in fact of collective nature and displays universal features. We also study Q at finite temperature. We show that, close to the quantum phase transition, Q exhibits quantum-classical crossover of the system with universal scaling behavior. We evidence a non trivial pattern of thermal correlations resulting from the factorization phenomenon.

Modern advances in transformation optics and electromagnetic metamaterials made possible experimental demonstrations of highly unusual curvilinear optical spaces, such as various geometries necessary for electromagnetic cloaking. Recently we demonstrated that mapping light intensity in a hyperbolic metamaterial may also model the flow of time in an effective (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Curving such an effective spacetime creates experimental model of a toy big bang. Here we demonstrate that at low light levels this model may be used to emulate a fully covariant version of quantum mechanics in a (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. When quantum mechanical description is applied near the toy big bang, the Everett universal wave function formalism arises naturally, in which the wave function of the model universe appears to be a quantum superposition of mutually orthogonal parallel universe states.

<blockquote>
<p>
The Laplace operator in infinite quantum waveguides (e.g., a bent strip or a twisted tube) often has a point-like eigenvalue below the essential spectrum that corresponds to a trapped eigenmode of finite L2 norm. We revisit this statement for resonators with long but finite branches that we call &quot;finite waveguides&quot;. Although now there is no essential spectrum and all eigenfunctions have finite L2 norm, the trapping can be understood as an exponential decay of the eigenfunction inside the branches. We describe a general variational formalism for detecting trapped modes in such resonators. For finite waveguides with general cylindrical branches, we obtain a sufficient condition which determines the minimal length of branches for getting a trapped eigenmode. Varying the branch lengths may switch certain eigenmodes from non-trapped to trapped states. These concepts are illustrated for several typical waveguides (L-shape, bent strip, crossing of two stripes, etc.). We conclude that the well-established theory of trapping in infinite waveguides may be incomplete and require further development for being applied to microscopic quantum devices.

The dynamics of the nano-resonator is probed through time resolved nanocrystal fluorescence and photon correlation measurements, conveying the influence of a mechanical degree of freedom given to a non-classical photon emitter. Moreover, by immersing the system in a strong magnetic field gradient, we induce a magnetic coupling between the nanomechanical oscillator and the NV electronic spin, providing nanomotion readout through a single electronic spin. Spin-dependent forces inherent to this coupling scheme are essential in a variety of active cooling and entanglement protocols used in atomic physics, and should now be within the reach of nanomechanical hybrid systems.

These potentials can easily prevent successful optical trapping, if their configuration is not chosen carefully. Afterwards, we analyse the dipole trap experiments with different analytic models, in which different approximations are applied. According to these models the experimental results agree with recoil heating as the relevant heating effect. In addition, a Monte-Carlo simulation has been developed to refine the analysis. It reveals a large impact of the static electric potential on the dipole trap experiments in general. While it supports the results of the analytic models for the parameters used in the experiments, the analytic models cease their validity for significantly different parameters. Finally, we propose technical improvements for future realizations of experiments with optically trapped ions.

Using the variable phase method, we reformulate the Dirac equation governing the charge carriers in graphene into a nonlinear first-order differential equation from which we can treat both confined-state problems in electron waveguides and above-barrier scattering problems for arbitrary-shaped potential barriers and wells, decaying at large distances. We show that this method agrees with a known analytic result for a hyperbolic secant potential and go on to investigate the nature of more experimentally realizable electron waveguides, showing that, when the Fermi energy is set at the Dirac point, truly confined states are supported in pristine graphene. In contrast to exponentially-decaying potentials, we discover that the threshold potential strength at which the first confined state appears is vanishingly small for potentials decaying at large distances as a power law, but nonetheless further confined states are formed when the strength and spread of the potential reach a certain threshold.

The quantum evolution of a cloud of bosons initially localized on part of a one dimensional optical lattice and suddenly subjected to a linear ramp is studied, realizing a quantum analog of the &quot;Galileo ramp&quot; experiment. The main remarkable effects of this realistic setup are revealed using analytical and numerical methods. Only part of the particles are ejected for a high enough ramp, while the others remain self-trapped. Then, the trapped density profile displays rich dynamics with Josephson-like oscillations around a plateau. This setup, by coupling bound states to propagative modes, creates two diverging condensates for which the entanglement is computed and related to the equilibrium one. Further, we address the role of integrability on the entanglement and on the damping and thermalization of simple observables.
