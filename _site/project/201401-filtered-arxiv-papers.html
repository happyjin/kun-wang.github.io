    <p><strong>1.    Unitary Equivalence of Quantum Walks</strong><br>
Sandeep K Goyal, Thomas Konrad, Lajos Diósi<br>
Physics Letters A, Vol 379, 100-104 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0196">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0196</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple coined quantum walk in one dimension can be characterized by a $SU(2)$ operator with three parameters which represents the coin toss. However, different such coin toss operators lead to equivalent dynamics of the quantum walker. In this manuscript we present the unitary equivalence classes of quantum walks and show that all the nonequivalent quantum walks can be distinguished by a single parameter. Moreover, we argue that the electric quantum walks are equivalent to quantum walks with time dependent coin toss operator.

<p>
Progress in superconducting qubit experiments with greater numbers of qubits or advanced techniques such as feedback requires faster and more accurate state measurement. We have designed a multiplexed measurement system with a bandpass filter that allows fast measurement without increasing environmental damping of the qubits. We use this to demonstrate simultaneous measurement of four qubits on a single superconducting integrated circuit, the fastest of which can be measured to 99.8% accuracy in 140ns. This accuracy and speed is suitable for advanced multi-qubit experiments including surface code error correction.

<p><strong>3.    New Approach to Quantum Error Correction</strong><br>
Ri Qu, Bing-jian Shang, Yan-ru Bao, Yi-ping Ma<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0456">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0456</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Operator quantum error correction provides a unified framework for the known techniques of quantum error correction such as the standard error correction model, the method of decoherence-free subspaces, and the noiseless subsystem method. We first show an example of a new quantum error correction scheme which can not be described by operation quantum error correction. Then we introduce a different notion of noiseless subsystems according to the example. Base on this notion, we present a more unified approach which incorporates operator quantum error correction as a special case. Moreover, we also give a sufficient and necessary condition of quantum error correction using this approach. We show that this approach provides more recovery operations than operator quantum error correction, which possibly leads to simpler decoding procedures.

<p><strong>4.    Single-photon frequency conversion and multi-mode entanglement via constructive interference on Sagnac Loop</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Based on constructive interference in Sagnac waveguide loop, an e?cient scheme is proposed for selective frequency conversion and multifrequency modes W entanglement via input-output formalism. We can adjust the probability amplitudes of output photons by choosing parameter values properly. The tunable probability amplitude will lead to the generation of output photon with a selectable frequency and W photonic entanglement of di?erent frequencies modes in a wide range of parameter values. Our calculations show the present scheme is robust to the deviation of parameters and spontaneous decay.

<p><strong>5.    Non-Markovianity criteria for open system dynamics</strong><br>
N. Lo Gullo, I. Sinayskiy, Th. Busch, F. Petruccione<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1126">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1126</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A universal definition of non-Markovianity for open systems dynamics is proposed. It is extended from the classical definition to the quantum realm by showing that a `transition&#39; from the Markov to the non-Markov regime occurs when the correlations between the system and the environment, generated by their joint evolution, can no longer be neglected. The suggested definition is based on the comparison between measured correlation functions and those built by assuming that the system is in a Markov regime thus giving a figure of merit of the error coming from this assumption. It is shown that the knowledge of the dynamical map and initial condition of the system is not enough to fully characterise the non-Markovian dynamics of the reduced system. The example of three exactly solvable models, i.e. decoherence and spontaneous emission of the qubit in a bosonic bath and decoherence of the photon&#39;s polarization induced by interaction with its spacial degrees of freedom, reveals that previously proposed Markovianity criteria and measures which are based on dynamical map analysis fail to recognise non-Markov behaviour.

<p><strong>6.    A quantum-walk-inspired adiabatic algorithm for graph isomorphism</strong><br>
Dario Tamascelli, Luca Zanetti<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1278">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1278</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a 2-local quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism GI based on an adiabatic protocol. By exploiting continuous-time quantum-walks, we are able to avoid a mere diffusion over all possible configurations and to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the visited space. Within this restricted space, the graph isomorphism problem can be translated into the search of a satisfying assignment to a 2-SAT formula without resorting to perturbation gadgets or projective techniques. We present an analysis of the execution time of the algorithm on small instances of the graph isomorphism problem and discuss the issue of an implementation of the proposed adiabatic scheme on current quantum computing hardware.

<p><strong>7.    Self-avoiding quantum walks</strong><br>

Sci. Rep. 4, 4791 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1869">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1869</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks exhibit many unique characteristics compared to classical random walks. In the classical setting, self-avoiding random walks have been studied as a variation on the usual classical random walk. Classical self-avoiding random walks have found numerous applications, most notably in the modeling of protein folding. We consider the analogous problem in the quantum setting. We complement a quantum walk with a memory register that records where the walker has previously resided. The walker is then able to avoid returning back to previously visited sites. We parameterise the strength of the memory recording and the strength of the memory back-action on the walker&#39;s motion, and investigate their effect on the dynamics of the walk. We find that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce ideal quantum or classical random walk statistics, or a plethora of more elaborate diffusive phenomena. In some parameter regimes we observe a close correspondence between classical self-avoiding random walks and the quantum self-avoiding walk.

<p><strong>8.    Two-step measurement of the concurrence for hyperentangled state</strong><br>
Yu-Bo Sheng, Lan Zhou<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1971">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1971</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe an efficient way for measuring the concurrence of the hyperentanglement. In this protocol, the hyperentangled state is encoded in both polarization and momentum degrees of freedom. We show that the concurrences of both polarization and momentum entanglement can be conversed into the total success probability of picking up the odd-parity state and can be measured directly. This protocol requires the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct the quantum nondemolition measurement and does not resort to the sophisticated controlled-not gate operation. It is feasible in current experimental technology.

<p><strong>10.    Quantifying the effects of local many-qubit errors and non-local two-qubit errors on the surface code</strong><br>
Austin G. Fowler, John M. Martinis<br>
Phys. Rev. A 89, 032316 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2466">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2466</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum error correction codes are known to be able to tolerate arbitrary local errors given sufficient qubits. This includes correlated errors involving many local qubits. In this work, we quantify this level of tolerance, numerically studying the effects of many-qubit errors on the performance of the surface code. We find that if increasingly large area errors are at least moderately exponentially suppressed, arbitrarily reliable quantum computation can still be achieved with practical overhead. We furthermore quantify the effect of non-local two-qubit correlated errors, which would be expected in arrays of qubits coupled by a polynomially decaying interaction, and when using many-qubit coupling devices. We surprisingly find that the surface code is very robust to this class of errors, despite a provable lack of a threshold error rate when such errors are present.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present two efficient schemes which can simultaneously accomplish hyperentanglement concentration and purification for two-photon four-qubit systems in an unknown partially hyperentangled mixed states. The first can correct errors in the polarization entanglement and extract maximal hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode with additional partial frequency entanglement. The second uses additional maximal frequency entanglement to purify and concentrate hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode deterministically. Both of the two schemes are only based on existing optical devices and cross-Kerr nonlinearities.

<p><strong>12.    Quantum transfer through a non-Markovian environment under frequent measurements and Zeno effect</strong><br>
Luting Xu, Yunshan Cao, Xin-Qi Li, YiJing Yan, Shmuel Gurvitz<br>
Phys. Rev. A90, 022108 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3159">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3159</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study transitions of a particle between two wells, separated by a reservoir, under the condition that the particle is not detected in the reservoir. Conventional quantum trajectory theory predicts that such no-result continuous measurement would not affect these transitions. We demonstrate that it holds only for Markovian reservoirs (infinite bandwidth $\Lambda$). In the case of finite $\Lambda$, the probability of the particle&#39;s interwell transition is a function of the ratio $\Lambda/\nu$, where $\nu$ is the frequency of measurements. This scaling tells us that in the limit $\nu\to\infty$, the measurement freezes the initial state (the quantum Zeno effect), whereas for $\Lambda\to\infty$ it does not affect the particle&#39;s transition across the reservoir. The scaling is proved analytically by deriving a simple formula, which displays two regimes, with the Zeno effect and without the Zeno effect. It also supports a simple explanation of the Zeno effect entirely in terms of the energy-time uncertainty relation, with no explicit use of the projection postulate. Experimental tests of our predictions are discussed.

<p><strong>13.    Chirality asymptotic behavior and non-Markovianity in quantum walks on a line</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3243">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3243</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the time evolution of the chirality reduced density matrix for a discrete-time quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, which is obtained by tracing out the spatial degree of freedom. We analyze the standard case, without decoherence, and the situation where decoherence appears in the form of broken links in the lattice. By examining the trace distance for possible pairs of initial states as a function of time, we conclude that the evolution of the reduced density matrix is non-Markovian, in the sense defined in [H. P. Breuer, E. M. Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)]. As the level of noise increases, the dynamics approaches a Markovian process. The highest non-Markovianity corresponds to the case without decoherence. The reduced density matrix tends always to a well-defined limit that we calculate, but only in the decoherence-free case this limit is non-trivial.

<p>
Open quantum walks (OQW) are formulated as quantum Markov chains on graphs. It is shown that OQWs are a very useful tool for the formulation of dissipative quantum computing algorithms and for dissipative quantum state preparation. In particular, single qubit gates and the CNOT-gate are implemented as OQWs on fully connected graphs. Also, dissipative quantum state preparation of arbitrary single qubit states and of all two-qubit Bell-states is demonstrated. Finally, the discrete time version of dissipative quantum computing is shown to be more efficient if formulated in the language of OQWs.

<p><strong>16.    Lower bounds on the communication complexity of two-party (quantum) processes</strong><br>
Alberto Montina, Stefan Wolf<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4126">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4126</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The process of state preparation, its transmission and subsequent measurement can be classically simulated through the communication of some amount of classical information. Recently, we proved that the minimal communication cost is the minimum of a convex functional over a space of suitable probability distributions. It is now proved that this optimization problem is the dual of a geometric programming maximization problem, which displays some appealing properties. First, the number of variables grows linearly with the input size. Second, the objective function is linear in the input parameters and the variables. Finally, the constraints do not depend on the input parameters. These properties imply that, once a feasible point is found, the computation of a lower bound on the communication cost in any two-party process is linearly complex. The studied scenario goes beyond quantum processes and includes the communication complexity scenario introduced by Yao. We illustrate the method by analytically deriving some non-trivial lower bounds. Finally, we conjecture the lower bound $n 2^n$ for a noiseless quantum channel with capacity $n$ qubits. This bound can have an interesting consequence in the context of the recent quantum-foundational debate on the reality of the quantum state.

Good spatial overlap of photon modes within pairs has been verified using the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer and the preparation of polarization entanglement in the Shih-Alley configuration, yielding visibilities consistently above 90%.

<p>
Can quantum mechanics help us in building intelligent robots and agents? One of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.

<blockquote>
<p>
Linear optical quantum Fredkin gate can be applied to quantum computing and quantum multi-user communication network. In the existing linear optical scheme, two single photon detectors (SPDs) are used to heralding the success of the quantum Fredkin gate while they have no photon count. But analysis results show that for non-perfect SPD the lower the detector efficiency, the higher the heralded success rate by this scheme. We propose an improved linear optical quantum Fredkin gate by designing a new heralding scheme with an auxiliary qubit and only one SPD, in which the higher the detection efficiency of the heralding detector, the higher the success rate of the gate. The new heralding scheme can also work efficiently under non-ideal single photon source. Based on this quantum Fredkin gate, large-scale quantum switching networks can be built. As an example, a quantum Benes network in which only one SPD is used is shown.

<p>
We have developed a quantum annealing processor, based on an array of tunably coupled rf-SQUID flux qubits, fabricated in a superconducting integrated circuit process [1]. Implementing this type of processor at a scale of 512 qubits and 1472 programmable inter-qubit couplers and operating at ~ 20 mK has required attention to a number of considerations that one may ignore at the smaller scale of a few dozen or so devices. Here we discuss some of these considerations, and the delicate balance necessary for the construction of a practical processor that respects the demanding physical requirements imposed by a quantum algorithm. In particular we will review some of the design trade-offs at play in the floor-planning of the physical layout, driven by the desire to have an algorithmically useful set of inter-qubit couplers, and the simultaneous need to embed programmable control circuitry into the processor fabric. In this context we have developed a new ultra-low power embedded superconducting digital-to-analog flux converters (DACs) used to program the processor with zero static power dissipation, optimized to achieve maximum flux storage density per unit area. The 512 single-stage, 3520 two-stage, and 512 three-stage flux-DACs are controlled with an XYZ addressing scheme requiring 56 wires. Our estimate of on-chip dissipated energy for worst-case reprogramming of the whole processor is ~ 65 fJ. Several chips based on this architecture have been fabricated and operated successfully at our facility, as well as two outside facilities (see for example [2]).

Quantum walks on graphs can model physical processes and serve as efficient tools in quantum information theory.

We develop novel analytic methods based on the theory of random unitary operations which help us to determine explicitly the asymptotic dynamics of quantum walks on 2D finite integer lattices with percolation. Based on this theory we find new unexpected features of percolated walks like asymptotic position inhomogeneity or special directional symmetry breaking.

<blockquote>
<p>
The realisation of large-scale quantum computing is no longer simply a hardware question. The rapid development of quantum technology has resulted in dozens of control and programming problems that should be directed towards the classical computer science and engineering community. One such problem is known as Pauli tracking. Methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are compatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum teleportation protocols. These protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and result in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation. These byproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself. Instead, byproduct operators are tracked through the circuit and output results reinterpreted. This tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it is assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed. In this work we help fill this gap and present an algorithm for tracking byproduct operators through a quantum computation. We formulate this work based on quantum gate sets that are compatible with all major forms of quantum error correction and demonstrate the completeness of the algorithm.

Nonequilibrium steady states are investigated in a coupled cavity QED array system which is pumped by a thermal bath and dissipated through cavity loss. In the coherent (non-zero photon amplitude) phase, plateau regions appear, where the steady states become unchanged against the variation of the chemical potential of the thermal bath. The cavity loss plays a crucial role for the plateaus: the plateaus appear only if the cavity loss exists, and the photon leakage current, which is induced by the loss, is essential to the mechanism of the plateaus.

Protecting quantum information from decoherence due to environmental noise is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation. To this end, standard quantum error correction employs parallel projective measurements of individual particles, which makes the system extremely complicated. Here we propose measurement-free topological protection in two dimension without any selective addressing of individual particles. We make use of engineered dissipative dynamics and feedback operations to reduce the entropy generated by decoherence in such a way that quantum information is topologically protected. We calculate an error threshold, below which quantum information is protected, without assuming selective addressing, projective measurements, nor instantaneous classical processing. All physical operations are local and translationally invariant, and no parallel projective measurement is required, which implies high scalability. Furthermore, since the engineered dissipative dynamics we utilized has been well studied in quantum simulation, the proposed scheme can be a promising route progressing from quantum simulation to fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

<p><strong>26.    Fidelity Threshold of the Surface Code Beyond Single-Qubit Error Models</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The surface code is one the most promising alternatives for implementing fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum information processing. Its high threshold for single-qubit errors under stochastic noise is one of its most attrative features. We develop an exact formulation for the fidelity of the surface code that allows us to probe much further on this promise of strong protection. This formulation goes beyond the stochastic single-qubit error model approximation and can take into account both correlated errors and inhomogeneities in the coupling between physical qubits and the environment. For the case of a bit-flipping environment, we map the complete evolution after one quantum error correction cycle onto the problem of computing correlation functions of a two-dimensional Ising model with boundary fields. Exact results for the fidelity threshold of the surface code are then obtained for several relevant types of noise. Analytical predictions for a representative case are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

<blockquote>
<p>
An open quantum walk formalism for dissipative quantum computing is presented. The approach is illustrated with the examples of the Toffoli gate and the Quantum Fourier Transform for 3 and 4 qubits. It is shown that the algorithms based on the open quantum walk formalism are more efficient than the canonical dissipative quantum computing approach. In particular, the open quantum walks can be designed to converge faster to the desired steady state and to increase the probability of detection of the outcome of the computation.

<p><strong>28.    On the non-locality of tripartite non-signaling boxes emerging from wirings</strong><br>
Jan Tuziemski, Karol Horodecki<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
It has been recently shown, that some of the tripartite boxes admitting bilocal decomposition, lead to non-locality under wiring operation applied to two of the subsystems [R. Gallego et al. Physical Review Letters 109, 070401 (2012)]. In the following, we study this phenomenon quantitatively. Basing on the known classes of boxes closed under wirings, we introduced multipartite monotones which are counterparts of bipartite ones - the non-locality cost and robustness of non-locality. We then provide analytical lower bounds on both the monotones in terms of the Maximal Non-locality which can be obtained by Wirings (MWN). We prove also upper bounds for the MWN of a given box, based on the weight of boxes signaling in a particular direction, that appear in its bilocal decomposition. We study different classes of partially local boxes and find MWN for each class, using Linear Programming. We identify also the wirings which lead to MWN and exhibit that some of them can serve as a witness of certain classes. We conclude with example of partially local boxes being analogue of quantum states that allow to distribute entanglement in separable manner.

<blockquote>
<p>
Rather than an a priori arena in which events take place, space-time is a construction of our mind making possible a particular kind of ordering of events. As quantum entanglement is a property of states independent of classical distances, the notion of space and time has to be revised to represent the holistic interconnection of quanta. We also speculate about various forms of reprogramming, or reconfiguring, the propagation of information for multipartite statistics and in quantum field theory.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report the first entanglement generation experiment using an on-chip slow light device. With highly efficient spontaneous four-wave mixing enhanced by the slow light effect in a coupled resonator optical waveguide based on a silicon photonic crystal, we generated 1.5-$\mu$m-band high-dimensional time-bin entangled photon pairs. We undertook two-photon interference experiments and observed the coincidence fringes with visibilities $&gt;74\%$. The present result enables us to realize an on-chip entanglement source with a very small footprint, which is an essential function for quantum information processing based on integrated quantum photonics.

<blockquote>
<p>
When two chains of quantum systems are driven at their ends by a two-mode squeezed reservoir, they approach a steady state characterized by the formation of many entangled pairs. Each pair is made of one element of the first and one of the second chain. This effect has been already predicted under the assumption of broadband squeezing. Here we investigate the situation of finite-bandwidth reservoirs. This is done by modeling the driving bath as the output field of a non-degenerate parametric oscillator. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics is studied within the theoretical framework of cascade open quantum systems. It is shown that the formation of pair-entangled structures occurs as long as the normal-mode splitting of the arrays does not overcome the squeezing bandwidth of the reservoir.

<p><strong>32.    Post-Markovian quantum master equations from classical environment fluctuations</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8262">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8262</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we demonstrate that two commonly used phenomenological post-Markovian quantum master equations can be derived without using any perturbative approximation. A system coupled to an environment characterized by self-classical configurational fluctuations, the latter obeying a Markovian dynamics, defines the underlying physical model. Both Shabani-Lidar equation [A. Shabani and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101(R) (2005)] and its associated approximated integro-differential kernel master equation are obtained by tracing out two different bipartite Markovian Lindblad dynamics where the environment fluctuations are taken into account by an ancilla system. Furthermore, conditions under which the non-Markovian system dynamics can be unravelled in terms of an ensemble of measurement trajectories are found. In addition, a non-Markovian quantum jump approach is formulated. Contrary to recent analysis [L. Mazzola, E. M. Laine, H. P. Breuer, S. Maniscalco, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. A 81, 062120 (2010)], we also demonstrate that these master equations, even with exponential memory functions, may lead to non-Markovian effects such as an environment-to-system backflow of information if the Hamiltonian system does not commutate with the dissipative dynamics.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the entanglement of magnetic impurities in an environment of electrons through successive scattering while an external magnetic field is applied. We show that the dynamics of the problem can be approximately described by a reduced model of three interacting spins, which reveals an intuitive view on how spins can be entangled by controlled electron scattering. The role of the magnetic field is rather crucial. Depending on the initial state configuration, the magnetic field can either increase or decrease the resulting entanglement but more importantly it can allow the impurities to be maximally entangled.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a twisted Szegedy walk for estimating the limit behavior of a discrete-time quantum walk on a crystal lattice, an infinite abelian covering graph, whose notion was introduced by [14]. First, we show that the spectrum of the twisted Szegedy walk on the quotient graph can be expressed by mapping the spectrum of a twisted random walk onto the unit circle. Secondly, we show that the spatial Fourier transform of the twisted Szegedy walk on a finite graph with appropriate parameters becomes the Grover walk on its infinite abelian covering graph. Finally, as an application, we show that if the Betti number of the quotient graph is strictly greater than one, then localization is ensured with some appropriated initial state. We also compute the limit density function for the Grover walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with flip flop shift, which implies the coexistence of linear spreading and localization. We partially obtain the abstractive shape of the limit density function: the support is within the $d$-dimensional sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{d}$, and $2^d$ singular points reside on the sphere&#39;s surface.

<blockquote>
<p>
We derive the statistics of scattered photons from a $\Lambda$- or ladder-type three-level emitter (3LE) embedded in a 1D open waveguide. The weak probe photons in the waveguide are coupled to one of the two allowed transitions of the 3LE, and the other transition is driven by a control beam. This system shows electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) which is accompanied with the Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) at a strong driving by the control beam, and some of these effects have been observed recently. We show that the nature of second-order coherence of the transmitted probe photons near two-photon resonance changes from bunching to antibunching to constant as strength of the control beam is ramped up from zero to a higher value where the ATS appears.

<p>
One-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks show a rich spectrum of topological phases that have so far been exclusively analysed in momentum space. In this work we introduce an alternative approach to topology which is based on the scattering matrix of a quantum walk, adapting concepts from time-independent systems. For gapped quantum walks, topological invariants at quasienergies 0 and {\pi} probe directly the existence of protected boundary states, while quantum walks with a non-trivial quasienergy winding have a discrete number of perfectly transmistting unidirectional modes. Our classification provides a unified framework that includes all known types of topology in one dimensional discrete-time quantum walks and is very well suited for the analysis of finite size and disorder effects. We provide a simple scheme to directly measure the topological invariants in an optical quantum walk experiment.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate &quot;the Wojcik model&quot; introduced and studied by Wojcik et al., which is a one-defect quantum walk (QW) having a single phase at the origin. They reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization. There are three types of measures having important roles in the study of QWs: time-averaged limit measure, weak limit measure, and stationary measure. The first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and the ballistic spreading in the QW. As Konno et al. suggested, the time-averaged limit and stationary measures are closely related to each other for some models. In this paper, we focus on a relation between the two measures for the Wojcik model. The stationary measure was already obtained by our previous work. Here, we get the time-averaged limit measure by several methods. Our results show that the stationary measure is a special case of the time-averaged limit measure.

This paper presents the first realisation of a simultaneous $^{87}$Rb -$^{85}$Rb Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer with Bose-condensed atoms. A number of ambitious proposals for precise terrestrial and space based tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle rely on such a system. This implementation utilises hybrid magnetic-optical trapping to produce spatially overlapped condensates with a duty cycle of 20s. A horizontal optical waveguide with co-linear Bragg beamsplitters and mirrors is used to simultaneously address both isotopes in the interferometer. We observe a non-linear phase shift on a non-interacting $^{85}$Rb interferometer as a function of interferometer time, $T$, which we show arises from inter-isotope scattering with the co-incident $^{87}$Rb interferometer. A discussion of implications for future experiments is given.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6848">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6848</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce and study a new model of interactive proofs: AM(k), or Arthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-known MIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent random challenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in detail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity class QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right. We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for 3SAT, in which the Merlins&#39; challenges and responses consist of only n^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP with a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithms nearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never been previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT protocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of certain entangled games. In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT protocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins never provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for all k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games, which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on subsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be closely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.

<blockquote>
<p>
When one of the parameters in the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion of a system is modulated, particles can be generated out of the quantum vacuum. This phenomenon is known as the dynamical Casimir effect, and it was recently realized experimentally in systems of superconducting circuits, for example by using modulated resonators made of coplanar waveguides, or arrays of superconducting quantum intereference devices (SQUIDs) forming a Josephson metamaterial. In this paper, we consider a simple electrical circuit model for dynamical Casimir effects, consisting of an LC resonator, with the inductor modulated externally at 10.8 GHz and with the resonant frequency tunable over a range of $\pm$ 400 MHz around 5.4 GHz. The circuit is analyzed classically using a circuit simulator (APLAC). We demonstrate that if an additional source of classical noise couples to the resonator (on top of the quantum vacuum), for example via dissipative &quot;internal modes&quot;, then the resulting spectrum of the photons in the cavity will present two strongly asymmetric branches. However, according to the theory of the dynamical Casimir effect, these branches should be symmetric, a prediction which is confirmed by our experimental data. The simulation presented here therefore shows that the origin of the photons generated in our experiment with Josephson metamaterials is the quantum vacuum, and not a spurious classical noise source.
