    <p><strong>1.    Quantum walk based search algorithms</strong><br>
Miklos Santha<br>
5th Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC08), Xian, April 2008, LNCS 4978, 31-46<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0059">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0059</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this survey paper we give an intuitive treatment of the discrete time quantization of classical Markov chains. Grover search and the quantum walk based search algorithms of Ambainis, Szegedy and Magniez et al. will be stated as quantum analogues of classical search procedures. We present a rather detailed description of a somewhat simplified version of the MNRS algorithm. Finally, in the query complexity model, we show how quantum walks can be applied to the following search problems: Element Distinctness, Matrix Product Verification, Restricted Range Associativity, Triangle, and Group Commutativity.

<p><strong>2.    On the hitting times of quantum versus random walks</strong><br>
Frederic Magniez, Ashwin Nayak, Peter C. Richter, Miklos Santha<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0084">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0084</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we define new Monte Carlo type classical and quantum hitting times, and we prove several relationships among these and the already existing Las Vegas type definitions. In particular, we show that for some marked state the two types of hitting time are of the same order in both the classical and the quantum case. Further, we prove that for any reversible ergodic Markov chain $P$, the quantum hitting time of the quantum analogue of $P$ has the same order as the square root of the classical hitting time of $P$. We also investigate the (im)possibility of achieving a gap greater than quadratic using an alternative quantum walk. Finally, we present new quantum algorithms for the detection and finding problems. The complexities of both algorithms are related to the new, potentially smaller, quantum hitting times. The detection algorithm is based on phase estimation and is particularly simple. The finding algorithm combines a similar phase estimation based procedure with ideas of Tulsi from his recent theorem for the 2D grid. Extending his result, we show that for any state-transitive Markov chain with unique marked state, the quantum hitting time is of the same order for both the detection and finding problems.

<p><strong>3.    Non-malleable encryption of quantum information</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Jan Bouda, Andreas Winter<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0353">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0353</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the notion of &quot;non-malleability&quot; of a quantum state encryption scheme (in dimension d): in addition to the requirement that an adversary cannot learn information about the state, here we demand that no controlled modification of the encrypted state can be effected. We show that such a scheme is equivalent to a &quot;unitary 2-design&quot; [Dankert et al.], as opposed to normal encryption which is a unitary 1-design. Our other main results include a new proof of the lower bound of (d^2-1)^2+1 on the number of unitaries in a 2-design [Gross et al.], which lends itself to a generalization to approximate 2-design. Furthermore, while in prime power dimension there is a unitary 2-design with =&lt; d^5 elements, we show that there are always approximate 2-designs with O(epsilon^{-2} d^4 log d) elements.

<p><strong>4.    Ground-state statistics from annealing algorithms: Quantum vs classical approaches</strong><br>
Yoshiki Matsuda, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Helmut G Katzgraber<br>
New J. Phys. 11 (2009) 073021<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0365">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0365</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the performance of quantum annealing for systems with ground-state degeneracy by directly solving the Schr\&quot;odinger equation for small systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for larger systems. The results indicate that naive quantum annealing using a transverse field may not be well suited to identify all degenerate ground-state configurations, although the value of the ground-state energy is often efficiently estimated. An introduction of quantum transitions to all states with equal weights is shown to greatly improve the situation but with a sacrifice in the annealing time. We also clarify the relation between the spin configurations in the degenerate ground states and the probabilities that those states are obtained by quantum annealing. The strengths and weaknesses of quantum annealing for problems with degenerate ground states are discussed in comparison with classical simulated annealing.

Michele Mosca<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0369">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0369</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This article surveys the state of the art in quantum computer algorithms, including both black-box and non-black-box results. It is infeasible to detail all the known quantum algorithms, so a representative sample is given. This includes a summary of the early quantum algorithms, a description of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup algorithms (including Shor&#39;s factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms), quantum searching and amplitude amplification, quantum algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical systems, several non-trivial generalizations of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem (and related techniques), the quantum walk paradigm for quantum algorithms, the paradigm of adiabatic algorithms, a family of ``topological&#39;&#39; algorithms, and algorithms for quantum tasks which cannot be done by a classical computer, followed by a discussion.

<p><strong>6.    Analog Grover search by adiabatic passage in a cavity-laser-atom system</strong><br>
D. Daems, S. Guérin<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 022330 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1181">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1181</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A physical implementation of the adiabatic Grover search is theoretically investigated in a system of N identical three-level atoms trapped in a single mode cavity. Some of the atoms are marked through the presence of an energy gap between their two ground states. The search is controlled by two partially delayed lasers which allow a deterministic adiabatic transfer from an initially entangled state to the marked states. Pulse schemes are proposed to satisfy the Grover speedup either exactly or approximately, and the success rate of the search is calculated.

<p><strong>7.    The Study of Entangled States in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information Science</strong><br>
Hyeyoun Chung<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1546">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1546</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This thesis explores the use of entangled states in quantum computation and quantum information science. Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no classical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable resource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We first investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled states (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical graphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be characterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and manipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose codewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation concerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to carry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that transversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors through a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost all QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits for creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to harness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to extract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state using local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create entangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the input parameters.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum algorithm design using dynamic learning</strong><br>
E.C. Behrman, J.E. Steck, P. Kumar, K.A. Walsh<br>
Quantum Information and Computation, vol. 8, No. 1&amp;2, pp. 12-29 (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1558">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1558</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a dynamic learning paradigm for &quot;programming&quot; a general quantum computer. A learning algorithm is used to find the control parameters for a coupled qubit system, such that the system at an initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation. This can be thought of as a quantum neural network. We first apply the method to a system of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates XOR and XNOR. Training of the phase produces a gate congruent to the CNOT modulo a phase shift. Striking out for somewhat more interesting territory, we attempt learning of an entanglement witness for a two qubit system. Simulation shows a reasonably successful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlation function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts; however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure the entanglement of an otherwise unknown state. The method is easily extended to multiple qubits or to quNits.

<p><strong>9.    Decoherence-free quantum information in Markovian systems</strong><br>
Manas K. Patra, Peter G. Brooke<br>
Phys. Rev. A 78, 010308(R) (2008)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1640">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1640</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Decoherence in Markovian systems can result indirectly from the action of a system Hamiltonian which is usually fixed and unavoidable. Here, we show that in general in Markovian systems, because of the system Hamiltonian, quantum information decoheres. We give conditions for the system Hamiltonian that must be satisfied if coherence is to be preserved. Finally, we show how to construct robust subspaces for quantum information processing.

<p><strong>10.    Architectural design for a topological cluster state quantum computer</strong><br>
Simon J. Devitt, Austin G. Fowler, Ashley M. Stephens, Andrew D. Greentree, Lloyd C.L. Hollenberg, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto<br>
New. J. Phys. 11, 083032 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1782">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1782</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The development of a large scale quantum computer is a highly sought after goal of fundamental research and consequently a highly non-trivial problem. Scalability in quantum information processing is not just a problem of qubit manufacturing and control but it crucially depends on the ability to adapt advanced techniques in quantum information theory, such as error correction, to the experimental restrictions of assembling qubit arrays into the millions. In this paper we introduce a feasible architectural design for large scale quantum computation in optical systems. We combine the recent developments in topological cluster state computation with the photonic module, a simple chip based device which can be used as a fundamental building block for a large scale computer. The integration of the topological cluster model with this comparatively simple operational element addresses many significant issues in scalable computing and leads to a promising modular architecture with complete integration of active error correction exhibiting high fault-tolerant thresholds.

<p><strong>11.    Maximal Success Probabilities of Linear-Optical Quantum Gates</strong><br>
Dmitry B. Uskov, Lev Kaplan, A. Matthew Smith, Sean D. Huver, Jonathan P. Dowling<br>
Phys. Rev. A 79, 042326 (2009).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1926">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1926</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Numerical optimization is used to design linear-optical devices that implement a desired quantum gate with perfect fidelity, while maximizing the success rate. For the 2-qubit CS (or CNOT) gate, we provide numerical evidence that the maximum success rate is $S=2/27$ using two unentangled ancilla resources; interestingly, additional ancilla resources do not increase the success rate. For the 3-qubit Toffoli gate, we show that perfect fidelity is obtained with only three unentangled ancilla photons -- less than in any existing scheme -- with a maximum $S=0.00340$. This compares well with $S=(2/27)^2/2 \approx 0.00274$, obtainable by combining two CNOT gates and a passive quantum filter [PRA 68, 064303 (2003)]. The general optimization approach can easily be applied to other areas of interest, such as quantum error correction, cryptography, and metrology [arXiv:0807.4906, PRL 99 070801 (2007)].

<p><strong>12.    Locality, detection efficiencies, and probability polytopes</strong><br>
J. Wilms, Y. Disser, G. Alber, I. C. Percival<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2126">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2126</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a detailed investigation of minimum detection efficiencies, below which locality cannot be violated by any quantum system of any dimension in bipartite Bell experiments. Lower bounds on these minimum detection efficiencies are determined with the help of linear programming techniques. Our approach is based on the observation that any possible bipartite quantum correlation originating from a quantum state in an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space is sandwiched between two probability polytopes, namely the local (Bell) polytope and a corresponding nonlocal no-signaling polytope. Numerical results are presented demonstrating the dependence of these lower bounds on the numbers of inputs and outputs of the bipartite physical system.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2258">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2258</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive an approximate Gaussian solution of the Lindblad equation in the semiclassical limit, given a general Hamiltonian and linear coupling with the environment. The theory is carried out in the chord representation and describes the evolved quantum characteristic function, which gives direct access to the Wigner function and the position representation of the density operator by Fourier transforms. The propagation is based on a system of non-linear equations taking place in a double phase space, which coincides with Heller&#39;s theory of unitary evolution of Gaussian wave packets when the Lindbladian part is zero.

<p><strong>14.    Mixing of Quantum Walks on Generalized Hypercubes</strong><br>
Ana Best, Markus Kliegl, Shawn Mead-Gluchacki, Christino Tamon<br>
International Journal of Quantum Information 6(6):1135-1148, 2008.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2382">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2382</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study continuous-time quantum walks on graphs which generalize the hypercube. The only known family of graphs whose quantum walk instantaneously mixes to uniform is the Hamming graphs with small arities. We show that quantum uniform mixing on the hypercube is robust under the addition of perfect matchings but not much else. Our specific results include: (1) The graph obtained by augmenting the hypercube with an additive matching is instantaneous uniform mixing whenever the parity of the matching is even, but with a slower mixing time. This strictly includes Moore-Russell&#39;s result on the hypercube. (2) The class of Hamming graphs is not uniform mixing if and only if its arity is greater than 5. This is a tight characterization of quantum uniform mixing on Hamming graphs; previously, only the status of arity less than 5 was known. (3) The bunkbed graph B(A[f]), defined by a hypercube-circulant matrix A and a Boolean function f, is not uniform mixing if the Fourier transform of f has small support. This explains why the hypercube is uniform mixing and why the join of two hypercubes is not.

<p><strong>15.    Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, John Watrous<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2669">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2669</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
While closed timelike curves (CTCs) are not known to exist, studying their consequences has led to nontrivial insights in general relativity, quantum information, and other areas. In this paper we show that if CTCs existed, then quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers: both would have the (extremely large) power of the complexity class PSPACE, consisting of all problems solvable by a conventional computer using a polynomial amount of memory. This solves an open problem proposed by one of us in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a &quot;causal consistency&quot; condition is imposed, meaning that Nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum) fixed-point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a fixed-point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in polynomial space. This theorem might have independent applications in quantum information.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2874">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2874</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the possibility of an implementation of N-qubit (N&gt;3) Grover search in cavity QED, based on a fast operation of N-qubit controlled phase-flip with atoms in resonance with the cavity mode. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that, our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find a marked state with high fidelity and high success probability. As cavity decay is involved in our quantum trajectory treatment, we could analytically understand the implementation of a Grover search subject to dissipation, which would be very helpful for relevant experiments.

Frederick W. Strauch<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3403">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3403</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The effect of decoherence on the continuous-time quantum walk on the hypercube is revisited. Previously, an exact solution was found for a decoherence model that preserved the effective tensor-product form of the dynamics. Here a new model is presented, inspired by perfect quantum state transfer in qubit networks. A perturbative solution is found for the dynamics of this model which is not of a tensor-product form. In contrast to previous results, the hitting probability has a lower bound that is independent of the hypercube dimension.

Aji A. Anappara, Simone De Liberato, Alessandro Tredicucci, Cristiano Ciuti, Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Fabio Beltram<br>
Physical Review B 79 (2009) 201303<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3720">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3720</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a microcavity, light-matter coupling is quantified by the vacuum Rabi frequency $\Omega_R$. When $\Omega_R$ is larger than radiative and non-radiative loss rates, the system eigenstates (polaritons) are linear superposition of photonic and electronic excitations, a condition actively investigated in diverse physical implementations. Recently, a quantum electrodynamic regime (ultra-strong coupling) was predicted when $\Omega_R$ becomes comparable to the transition frequency. Here we report unambiguous signatures of this regime in a quantum-well intersubband microcavity. Measuring the cavity-polariton dispersion in a room-temperature linear optical experiment, we directly observe the anti-resonant light-matter coupling and the photon-energy renormalization of the vacuum field.

<p>
We investigate a state discrimination problem in operationally the most general framework to use a probability, including both classical, quantum theories, and more. In this wide framework, introducing closely related family of ensembles (which we call a {\it Helstrom family of ensembles}) with the problem, we provide a geometrical method to find an optimal measurement for state discrimination by means of Bayesian strategy. We illustrate our method in 2-level quantum systems and in a probabilistic model with square-state space to reproduce e.g., the optimal success probabilities for binary state discrimination and $N$ numbers of symmetric quantum states. The existences of families of ensembles in binary cases are shown both in classical and quantum theories in any generic cases.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the entanglement properties of pure quantum states describing $n$ qubits. We characterize all multipartite states which can be maximally entangled to local auxiliary systems using controlled operations. A state has this property iff one can construct out of it an orthonormal basis by applying independent local unitary operations. This implies that those states can be used to encode locally the maximum amount of $n$ bits. Examples of these states are the so--called stabilizer states, which are used for quantum error correction and one--way quantum computing. We give a simple characterization of these states and construct a complete set of commuting unitary observables which characterize the state uniquely. Furthermore we show how these states can be prepared and discuss their applications.

The extraordinary properties of resonant four-wave mixing of backward waves in doped negative-index materials are investigated. The feasibility of independent engineering of negative refractive index and nonlinear optical response as well as quantum control of the nonlinear propagation process in such composites is shown due to the coherent energy transfer from the control to the signal field. Laser-induced transparency, quantum switching, frequency-tunable narrow-band filtering, amplification, and realizing a miniature mirrorless optical parametric generator of the entangled backward and ordinary waves are among the possible applications of the investigated processes.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2906">http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2906</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that quantum coherence of biomolecular excitons is maintained over exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non-Markovian protein-solvent environment. Using a numerically exact approach, we demonstrate that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of Forster coupled excitons, in contrast to a Markovian environment. We consider the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement. This persists to surprisingly high temperatures, even higher than the excitonic gap and is absent for a Markovian bath.
