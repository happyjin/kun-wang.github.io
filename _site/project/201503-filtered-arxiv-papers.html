<blockquote>
<p>
The potential of computing based on quantum mechanics has triggered a quest for a scalable quantum bit or qubit technology with local control and long coherence lifetimes. In silicon, which is preferred as a platform due to the maturity of its technology both the on nano- and wafer-scale, nuclear spins of ionized donors show very promising storage times, but due to their weak interactions are challenging to manipulate locally. We demonstrate a mechanism to address arsenic donors in Si by mechanical tuning via the quadrupole interaction allowing for local qubit operations and show that the negative effects on the coherence lifetime can be removed by dynamical decoupling. This will enable local quantum operations which are essential for processing and error correction in a quantum memory.

<p><strong>2.    The observation of photon echoes from evanescently coupled rare-earth ions in a planar waveguide</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We report the measurement of the inhomogeneous linewidth, homogeneous linewidth and spin state lifetime of Pr3+ ions in a novel waveguide architecture. The TeO2 slab waveguide deposited on a bulk Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal allows the 3H4 - 1D2 transition of Pr3+ ions to be probed by the optical evanescent field that extends into the substrate. The 2 GHz inhomogeneous linewidth, the optical coherence time of 70 +- 5 us, and the spin state lifetime of 9.8 +- 0.3 s indicate that the properties of ions interacting with the waveguide mode are consistent with those of bulk ions. This result establishes the foundation for large, integrated and high performance rare-earth-ion quantum systems based on a waveguide platform.

<p><strong>3.    A Simple Method for Finding the Scattering Coefficients of Quantum Graphs</strong><br>
Seth S. Cottrell<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00253">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00253</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are roughly analogous to classical random walks, and like classical walks they have been used to find new (quantum) algorithms. When studying the behavior of large graphs or combinations of graphs it is useful to find the response of a subgraph to signals of different frequencies. In so doing we can replace an entire subgraph with a single vertex with frequency dependent scattering coefficients. In this paper a simple technique for quickly finding the scattering coefficients of any quantum graph will be presented. These scattering coefficients can be expressed entirely in terms of the characteristic polynomial of the graph&#39;s time step operator. Moreover, with these in hand we can easily derive the &quot;impulse response&quot; which is the key to predicting the response of a graph to any signal. This gives us a powerful set of tools for rapidly understanding the behavior of graphs or for reducing a large graph into its constituent subgraphs regardless of how they are connected.

<p><strong>4.    Anonymous broadcasting with a continuous-variable topological quantum code</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00717">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00717</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Broadcasting information anonymously becomes more difficult as surveillance technology improves, but remarkably, quantum protocols exist that enable provably traceless broadcasting. The difficulty is making scalable entangled resource states that are robust to errors. We propose an anonymous broadcasting protocol that uses a continuous-variable toric-code state, which can be produced using current technology. High squeezing enables large transmission bandwidth and strong anonymity, and the topological nature of the state enables local error correction.

<p><strong>5.    Quantifying temporal and spatio-temporal steering provides a practical measure of strong non-Markovianity</strong><br>
Shin-Liang Chen, Neill Lambert, Che-Ming Li, Adam Miranowicz, Yueh-Nan Chen, Franco Nori<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00836">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00836</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a type of quantum correlation which allows one to remotely prepare, or steer, the state of a distant quantum system. While EPR steering can be thought of as a purely spatial correlation there does exist a temporal analogue, in the form of single-system temporal steering. However, a precise quantification of such temporal steering has been lacking. Here we show that it can be measured, via semidefinite programming, with a temporal steerable weight, in direct analogy to the recently proposed EPR steerable weight. We find a unique application for both, this and a spatio-temporal extension, by showing that they are monotonically-decreasing functions under completely-positive trace-preserving maps and thus can be used to define a practical measure of strong non-Markovianity. Finally, we discuss how a spatio-temporal steerable weight can be used to check whether two nodes of a quantum network are quantum connected.

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate the emission of highly indistinguishable photons from a quasi-resonantly pumped coupled quantum dot--microcavity system operating in the regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Changing the sample temperature allows us to vary the quantum dot--cavity detuning, and on spectral resonance we observe a three-fold improvement in the Hong--Ou--Mandel interference visibility, reaching values in excess of 80\%. Our measurements off-resonance allow us to investigate varying Purcell enhancements, and to probe the dephasing environment at different temperatures and energy scales. By comparison with our microscopic model, we are able to identify pure-dephasing and not time-jitter as the dominating source of imperfections in our system.

<p><strong>7.    A Performance Estimator for Quantum Annealers: Gauge selection and Parameter Setting</strong><br>
Alejandro Perdomo-Ortiz, Joseph Fluegemann, Rupak Biswas, Vadim N. Smelyanskiy<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01083">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01083</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
With the advent of large-scale quantum annealing devices, several challenges have emerged. For example, it has been shown that the performance of a device can be significantly affected by several degrees of freedom when programming the device; a common example being gauge selection. To date, no experimentally-tested strategy exists to select the best programming specifications. We developed a score function that can be calculated from a number of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find the desired solution. We show how this performance estimator can be used to guide, for example, the selection of the optimal gauges out of a pool of random gauge candidates and how to select the values of parameters for which we have no a priori knowledge of the optimal value. For the latter, we illustrate the concept by applying the score function to set the strength of the parameter intended to enforce the embedding of the logical graph into the hardware architecture, a challenge frequently encountered in the implementation of real-world problem instances. Since the harder the problem instances, the more useful the strategies proposed in this work are, we expect the programming strategies proposed to significantly reduce the time of future benchmark studies and in help finding the solution of hard-to-solve real-world applications implemented in the next generation of quantum annealing devices.

<p><strong>8.    Sequential quantum mixing for slowly evolving sequences of Markov chains</strong><br>
Vedran Dunjko, Hans J. Briegel<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01334">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01334</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we consider the problem of preparation of the stationary distribution of irreducible, time-reversible Markov chains, which is a fundamental task in algorithmic Markov chain theory. For the classical setting, this task has a complexity lower bound of $\Omega(1/\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of the Markov chain, and other dependencies contribute only logarithmically. In the quantum case, the conjectured complexity is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}})$ (with other dependencies contributing only logarithmically). However, this bound has only been achieved for a few special classes of Markov chains. In this work, we provide a method for the sequential preparation of stationary distributions for sequences of general time-reversible $N-$state Markov chains, akin to the setting of simulated annealing methods. The complexity of preparation we achieve is $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} N^{1/4})$, neglecting logarithmic factors. While this result falls short of the conjectured optimal time, it still provides at least a quadratic improvement over other straightforward approaches for quantum mixing applied in this setting.

<p><strong>9.    Relation of classical non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum annealing</strong><br>
Hidetosni Nishimori<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02127">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02127</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-equilibrium dynamics of the Ising model is a classical stochastic process whereas quantum mechanics has no stochastic elements in the classical sense. Nevertheless, it has been known that there exists a close formal relationship between these two processes. We reformulate this relationship and use it to compare the efficiency of simulated annealing that uses classical stochastic processes and quantum annealing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It is shown that classical dynamics can be efficiently simulated by quantum-mechanical processes whereas the converse is not necessarily true. This may imply that quantum annealing may be regarded as a more powerful tool than simulated annealing for optimization problems.

<p><strong>10.    Classical-driving-enhanced parameter-estimation precision of a non-Markovian dissipative two-state system</strong><br>
Yan-Ling Li, Xing Xiao, Yao Yao<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 052105 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02260">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02260</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the phase parameter in a driven two-state system is studied within the framework of non-Markovian dissipative process. The influences of memory effects, classical driving and detunings on the parameter-estimation precision are demonstrated by exactly solving the Hamiltonian under rotating-wave approximation. In sharp contrast with the results obtained in the presence of Markovian dissipation, we find that classical driving can drastically enhance the QFI, namely, the precision of parameter estimation in the non-Markovian regime. Moreover, the parameter-estimation precision may even be preserved from the influence of surrounding non-Markovian dissipation with the assistance of classical driving. Remarkably, we reveal that the enhancement and preservation of QFI highly depend on the combination of classical driving and non-Markovian effects. Finally, a phenomenological explanation of the underlying mechanism is presented in detail via the quasimode theory

<p><strong>11.    The Road From Classical to Quantum Codes: A Hashing Bound Approaching Design Procedure</strong><br>
Zunaira Babar, Panagiotis Botsinis, Dimitrios Alanis, Soon Xin Ng, Lajos Hanzo<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Powerful Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are required for stabilizing and protecting fragile qubits against the undesirable effects of quantum decoherence. Similar to classical codes, hashing bound approaching QECCs may be designed by exploiting a concatenated code structure, which invokes iterative decoding. Therefore, in this paper we provide an extensive step-by-step tutorial for designing EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart aided concatenated quantum codes based on the underlying quantum-to-classical isomorphism. These design lessons are then exemplified in the context of our proposed Quantum Irregular Convolutional Code (QIRCC), which constitutes the outer component of a concatenated quantum code. The proposed QIRCC can be dynamically adapted to match any given inner code using EXIT charts, hence achieving a performance close to the hashing bound. It is demonstrated that our QIRCC-based optimized design is capable of operating within 0.4 dB of the noise limit.

<p>
We investigate the electromechanical coupling between a nanomechanical resonator and two parametrically coupled superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities that are driven by a two-mode squeezed microwave source. We show that, with the selective coupling of the resonator to the cavity Bogoliubov modes, the radiation-pressure type coupling can be greatly enhanced by several orders of magnitude, enabling the single photon strong coupling to be reached. This allows the investigation of a number of interesting phenomena such as photon blockade effects and the generation of nonclassical quantum states with electromechanical systems.

<p><strong>13.    Using non-Markovian measures to evaluate quantum master equations for photosynthesis</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02412">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02412</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
When dealing with system-reservoir interactions in an open quantum system, such as a photosynthetic light-harvesting complex, approximations are usually made to obtain the dynamics of the system. One question immediately arises: how good are these approximations, and in what ways can we evaluate them? Here, we propose to use entanglement and a measure of non-Markovianity as benchmarks for the deviation of approximate methods from exact results. We apply two frequently-used perturbative but non-Markovian approximations to a photosynthetic dimer model and compare their results with that of the numerically-exact hierarchy equation of motion (HEOM). This enables us to explore both entanglement and non-Markovianity measures as means to reveal how the approximations either overestimate or underestimate memory effects and quantum coherence. In addition, we show that both the approximate and exact results suggest that non-Markonivity can, counter-intuitively, increase with temperature, and with the coupling to the environment.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02437">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02437</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze a hybrid device by integrating a microscale diamond beam with a single built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin to a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavity. We find that under an ac electric field the quantized motion of the diamond beam can strongly couple to the single cavity photons via polarization interaction. Together with the strong spin-motion interaction via a large magnetic field gradient, it provides a hybrid quantum device where the diamond resonator can strongly couple both to the single microwave cavity photons and to the single NV center spin. This enables coherent information transfer and effective coupling between the NV spin and the CPW cavity via mechanically dark polaritons. This hybrid spin-electromechanical device, with tunable couplings by external fields, offers a realistic platform for implementing quantum information with single NV spins, diamond mechanical resonators, and single microwave photons.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional array of QED cavities where, besides the single-photon hopping, an additional coupling between neighboring cavities is mediated by an N-type four-level system. By varying the relative strength of the various couplings, the array is shown to exhibit a variety of quantum phases including a polaritonic Mott insulator, a density-wave and a superfluid phase. Our results have been obtained by means of numerical density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The phase diagram was obtained by analyzing the energy gaps for the polaritons, as well as through a study of two-point correlation functions.

<blockquote>
<p>
Magnetic resonance with ensembles of electron spins is nowadays performed in frequency ranges up to 240 GHz and in corresponding magnetic fields of up to 10 T. However, experiments with single electron and nuclear spins so far only reach into frequency ranges of several 10 GHz, where existing coplanar waveguide structures for microwave (MW) delivery are compatible with single spin readout techniques (e.g. electrical or optical readout). Here, we explore the frequency range up to 90 GHz, respectively magnetic fields of up to $\approx 3\,$T for single spin magnetic resonance in conjunction with optical spin readout. To this end, we develop MW resonators with optical single spin access. In our case, rectangular E-band waveguides guarantee low-loss supply of microwaves to the resonators. Three dimensional cavities, as well as coplanar waveguide resonators enhance MW fields by spatial and spectral confinement with a MW efficiency of $1.36\,\mathrm{mT/\sqrt{W}}$. We utilize single NV centers as hosts for optically accessible spins, and show, that their properties regarding optical spin readout known from smaller fields (<0.65 T) are retained up to fields of 3 T. In addition, we demonstrate coherent control of single nuclear spins under these conditions. Furthermore, our results extend the applicable magnetic field range of a single spin magnetic field sensor. Regarding spin based quantum registers, high fields lead to a purer product basis of electron and nuclear spins, which promises improved spin lifetimes. For example, during continuous single-shot readout the $^{14}$N nuclear spin shows second-long longitudinal relaxation times.

<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement distillation refers to the task of transforming a collection of weakly entangled pairs into fewer highly entangled ones. It is a core ingredient in quantum repeater protocols, needed to transmit entanglement over arbitrary distances in order to realise quantum key distribution schemes. Usually, it is assumed that the initial entangled pairs are i.i.d. distributed and uncorrelated with each other, an assumption that might not be reasonable at all in any entanglement generation process involving memory channels. Here, we introduce a framework that captures entanglement distillation in the presence of natural correlations arising from memory channels. Conceptually, we bring together ideas from condensed-matter physics - that of renormalisation and of matrix-product states and operators - with those of local entanglement manipulation, Markov chain mixing, and quantum error correction. We identify meaningful parameter regions for which we prove convergence to maximally entangled states, arising as the fixed points of a matrix-product operator renormalisation flow.

<p>
We consider the problem of constructing a &quot;universal set&quot; of Markovian processes, such that any Markovian open quantum system, described by a one-parameter semigroup of quantum channels, can be simulated through sequential simulations of processes from the universal set. In particular, for quantum systems of dimension $d$, we explicitly construct a universal set of semigroup generators, parametrized by $d^2-3$ continuous parameters, such that in order to simulate the dynamics of an arbitrary $d$ dimensional Markovian quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to be able to implement unitary operations on the system, and quantum channels from the semigroups generated by elements of the universal set of generators. Furthermore, assuming the ability to implement operations from the universal set, we provide an explicit algorithm for the efficient simulation of Markovian open quantum systems for which the number of distinct Lindblad operators scales polynomially with respect to the number of subsystems.

<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum random walk (QRW) is the term given to a family of algorithms governing the evolution of a discrete quantum system and as such has a founding role in the study of quantum computation. We contribute to the investigation of QRW phenomena by performing a detailed numerical study of discrete-time quantum walks. In one dimension (1D), we compute the structure of the probability distribution, which is not a smooth curve but shows oscillatory features on all length scales. By analyzing walks up to $N = 1000000$ steps, we discuss the scaling characteristics and limiting forms of the QRW in both real and Fourier space. In 2D, with a view to ready experimental realization, we consider two types of QRW, one based on a four-faced coin and the other on sequential flipping of a single two-faced coin. We show analytically and numerically that both QRWs may be generated using two two-faced coins, which in the first case are completely unentangled and in the second are maximally entangled. We draw on our 1D results to characterize the properties of both walks, demonstrating maximal speed-up and emerging semi-classical behavior in the maximally entangled QRW. We discuss existing and proposed experiments realizing these phenomena.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum annealing is a proposed combinatorial optimization technique meant to exploit quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling and entanglement. Real-world quantum annealing-based solvers require a combination of annealing and classical pre- and post-processing; at this early stage, little is known about how to partition and optimize the processing. This article presents an experimental case study of quantum annealing and some of the factors involved in real-world solvers, using a 504-qubit D-Wave Two machine and the graph isomorphism problem. To illustrate the role of classical pre-processing, a compact Hamiltonian is presented that enables a reduced Ising model for each problem instance. On random N-vertex graphs, the median number of variables is reduced from N^2 to fewer than N lg N and solvable graph sizes increase from N = 5 to N = 13. Additionally, a type of classical post-processing error correction is evaluated. While the solution times are not competitive with classical approaches to graph isomorphism, the enhanced solver ultimately classified correctly every problem that was mapped to the processor and demonstrated clear advantages over the baseline approach. The results shed some light on the nature of real-world quantum annealing and the associated hybrid classical-quantum solvers.

<p><strong>22.    Quantum Walk Search through Potential Barriers</strong><br>
Thomas G. Wong<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06605">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06605</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A randomly walking quantum particle searches for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices in Grover&#39;s $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ steps. This assumes that the particle can transition from one vertex to another, unhindered. Physically, however, it may need to tunnel through a potential barrier, perhaps due to an imperfect or non-ideal implementation of the walk. Then the particle has some amplitude of correctly hopping and some amplitude of staying put. We show that this causes the search to fail when the particle stays put with amplitude that scales greater than $1/\sqrt{N}$, so searching larger &quot;databases&quot; requires increasingly reliable hop operations. This condition also holds for search by continuous-time quantum walk.

By increasing the size of the quantum error correction code, both Bell measurement efficiency and photon-loss tolerance can be made arbitrarily high at the same time. As a main application, we show that all-optical quantum communication over large distances with communication rates similar to those of classical communication is possible solely based on local state teleportations using optical sources of encoded Bell states, fixed arrays of beam splitters, and photon detectors discriminating up to two photons. As another application, generalizing state teleportation to gate teleportation for quantum computation, we find that in order to achieve universality the intrinsic loss tolerance must be sacrificed and a minimal amount of feedforward has to be added.

<p><strong>25.    Correction to the geometric phase by structured environments: the onset of non-Markovian effects</strong><br>
Fernando C. Lombardo, Paula I. Villar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06897">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06897</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the geometric phase of a two-level system under the presence of a structured environment, particularly analysing its correction with the ohmicity parameter $s$ and the onset of non-Markovianity. We firstly examine the system coupled to a set of harmonic oscillators and studied the decoherence factor as function of the environment&#39;s ohmicity parameter. Secondly, we propose the two-level system coupled to a non-equilibrium environment, and show that these environments display non-Markovian effects for all values of the ohmicity parameter. The geometric phase of the two-level system is therefore computed under the presence of both types of environment. The correction to the unitary geometric phase is analysed in both, Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Under Markovian environments, the correction induced on the system&#39;s phase is mainly ruled by the coupling constant between the system and the environment, while in the non-Markovian regime, memory effects seem to trigger a significant correction to the unitary geometric phase. The result is significant to the quantum information processing based on the geometric phase in quantum open systems

<p><strong>26.    Classical capacity of a qubit depolarizing memory channel with Markovian correlated noise</strong><br>
Jaideep Mulherkar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07075">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07075</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the classical capacity of a forgetful quantum memory channel that switches between two qubit depolarizing channels according to an ergodic Markov chain. The capacity of this quantum memory channel depends on the parameters of the two depolarizing channels and the memory of the ergodic Markov chain. When the number of input qubit&#39;s is two, we show that depending on channel parameters either the maximally entangled input states or product input states achieve the classical capacity. Our conjecture based on numerics is that as the number of input qubits are increased the classical capacity approaches the product state capacity for all values of the parameters.

<p><strong>27.    Complexity of the XY antiferromagnet at fixed magnetization</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset, Zak Webb<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07083">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07083</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that approximating the ground energy of the antiferromagnetic XY model on a simple graph at fixed magnetization (given as part of the instance specification) is QMA-complete. To show this, we strengthen a previous result by establishing QMA-completeness for approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on simple graphs. Using a connection between the XY and Bose-Hubbard models that we exploited in previous work, this establishes QMA-completeness of the XY model.

<p><strong>28.    Two-walker discrete-time quantum walks on the line with percolation</strong><br>
Luca Rigovacca, Carlo Di Franco<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07113">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07113</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the behavior of two particles performing a quantum walk on the line when the possibility of having missing links is considered. We investigate two regimes, statical and dynamical percolation, that correspond to different time scales for the imperfections evolution with respect to the quantum walk evolution. We analyze how the (quantum) nature of the particles changes the output probabilities, and discuss the reasons giving rise to these differences.

<p><strong>29.    Quantum walks in synthetic gauge fields with 3D integrated photonics</strong><br>
Octavi Boada, Leonardo Novo, Fabio Sciarrino, Yasser Omar<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07172">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07172</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is great interest in designing photonic devices capable of disorder-resistant transport and information processing. In this work we propose to exploit 3D integrated photonic circuits for the realization of 2D discrete-time quantum walks in a background synthetic gauge field, for both the single and many walker case. The gauge fields are generated by introducing the appropriate phase shifts between waveguides. Polarization-independent phase shifts lead to an Abelian or magnetic field, a case we describe in detail. We characterize the single-particle Abelian quantum walk, finding that in the presence of disorder the magnetic field enhances transport due to the presence of topologically protected chiral edge states which do not localize. Polarization-dependent phase shifts lead to effective non-Abelian gauge fields, which could be adopted to realize of Rashba-like quantum walks with spin-orbit coupling. Our work introduces a flexible platform for the experimental study of multi-particle quantum walks in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which paves the way towards topologically robust transport of many-body states of photons.

<p><strong>30.    Quantum tight-binding chains with dissipative coupling</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07213">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07213</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a one-dimensional tight-binding chain of two-level systems coupled only through common dissipative Markovian reservoirs. This quantum chain can demonstrate anomalous thermodynamic behavior contradicting Fourier law. Population dynamics of individual systems of the chain is polynomial with the order determined by the initial state of the chain. The chain can simulate classically hard problems, such as multi-dimensional random walks.

<p><strong>31.    Superradiance for atoms trapped along a photonic crystal waveguide</strong><br>
A. Goban, C. -L. Hung, J. D. Hood, S. -P. Yu, J. A. Muniz, O. Painter, H. J. Kimble<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04503">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04503</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report observations of superradiance for atoms trapped in the near field of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). By fabricating the PCW with a band edge near the D$<em>1$ transition of atomic cesium, strong interaction is achieved between trapped atoms and guided-mode photons. Following short-pulse excitation, we record the decay of guided-mode emission and find a superradiant emission rate scaling as $\bar{\Gamma}</em>{\rm SR}\propto\bar{N}\cdot\Gamma_{\rm 1D}$ for average atom number $0.19 \lesssim \bar{N} \lesssim 2.6$ atoms, where $\Gamma_{\rm 1D}/\Gamma_0 =1.1\pm0.1$ is the peak single-atom radiative decay rate into the PCW guided mode and $\Gamma_{0}$ is the Einstein-$A$ coefficient for free space. These advances provide new tools for investigations of photon-mediated atom-atom interactions in the many-body regime.

<p><strong>32.    Reconstruction of Markovian dynamics from untimed data</strong><br>
Jochen Rau<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06495">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06495</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
I develop a theoretical framework for inferring nonequilibrium equations of motion from incomplete experimental data. I focus on genuinely irreversible, Markovian processes, for which the incomplete data are given in the form of snapshots of the macrostate at different instances of the evolution, yet without any information about the timing of these snapshots. A reconstruction of the equation of motion must therefore be preceded by a reconstruction of time.
