    <p><strong>1.    Frequency Conversion of Entangled State</strong><br>
Aihong Tan, Xiaojun Jia, Changde Xie<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73,033817(2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603006">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603006</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum characteristics of sum-frequency process in an optical cavity with an input signal optical beam, which is a half of entangled optical beams, are analyzed. The calculated results show that the quantum properties of the signal beam can be maintained after its frequency is conversed during the intracavity nonlinear optical interaction. The frequency-conversed output signal beam is still in an entangled state with the retained other half of initial entangled beams. The resultant quantum correlation spectra and the parametric dependences of the correlations on the initial squeezing factor, the optical losses and the pump power of the sum-frequency cavity are calculated. The proposed system for the frequency conversion of entangled state can be used in quantum communication network and the calculated results can provide direct references for the design of experimental systems.

<p><strong>2.    A general approach to physical realization of unambiguous quantum-state discrimination</strong><br>
Bing He, János A. Bergou<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603058">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603058</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a general scheme to realize the POVMs for the unambiguous discrimination of quantum states. For any set of pure states it enables us to set up a feasible linear optical circuit to perform their optimal discrimination, if they are prepared as single-photon states. An example of unknown states discrimination is discussed as the illustration of the general scheme.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum diffraction and interference of spatially correlated photon pairs and its Fourier-optical analysis</strong><br>
Ryosuke Shimizu, Keiichi Edamatsu, Tadashi Itoh<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603064">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603064</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present one- and two-photon diffraction and interference experiments involving parametric down-converted photon pairs. By controlling the divergence of the pump beam in parametric down-conversion, the diffraction-interference pattern produced by an object changes from a quantum (perfectly correlated) case to a classical (uncorrelated) one. The observed diffraction and interference patterns are accurately reproduced by Fourier-optical analysis taking into account the quantum spatial correlation. We show that the relation between the spatial correlation and the object size plays a crucial role in the formation of both one- and two-photon diffraction-interference patterns.

<p><strong>4.    A Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Selecting Announced States, Robust against Photon Number Splitting Attacks</strong><br>
Eguchi Makoto, Hagiwara Manabu, Hideki Imai<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603066">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603066</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new class of quantum key distribution protocol, that ended up to be robust against photon number splitting attacks in the weak laser pulse implementations. This protocol comprises of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, especially in aspects of controlling classical sifting procedures of two protocols. The protocol is more secure than both of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol, and the ultimate limit of robustness in the proposed protocol expands as well than both of them.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603074">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603074</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the implementation of binary projective measurements with linear optics. This problem can be viewed as a single-shot discrimination of two orthogonal pure quantum states. We show that any two orthogonal states can be perfectly discriminated using only linear optics, photon counting, coherent ancillary states, and feedforward. The statement holds in the asymptotic limit of large number of these physical resources.

<p><strong>6.    Experimental test for the conductivity properties from the Casimir force between metal and semiconductor</strong><br>
F. Chen, U. Mohideen, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko<br>
Phys.Rev. A74 (2006) 022103<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603111">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603111</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The experimental investigation of the Casimir force between a large metallized sphere and semiconductor plate is performed using an atomic force microscope. Improved calibration and measurement procedures permitted reduction in the role of different uncertainties. Rigorous statistical procedures are applied for the analysis of random, systematic and total experimental errors at 95% confidence. The theoretical Casimir force is computed for semiconductor plates with different conductivity properties taking into account all theoretical uncertainties discussed in literature. The comparison between experiment and theory is done at both 95 and 70% confidence. It is demonstrated that the theoretical results computed for the semiconductor plate used in experiment are consistent with data. At the same time, theory describing a dielectric plate is excluded by experiment at 70% confidence. Thus, the Casimir force is proved to be sensitive to the conductivity properties of semiconductors.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum Algorithms with Fixed Points: The Case of Database Search</strong><br>
Lov K. Grover, Apoorva Patel, Tathagat Tulsi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603132">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603132</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The standard quantum search algorithm lacks a feature, enjoyed by many classical algorithms, of having a fixed-point, i.e. a monotonic convergence towards the solution. Here we present two variations of the quantum search algorithm, which get around this limitation. The first replaces selective inversions in the algorithm by selective phase shifts of $\frac{\pi}{3}$. The second controls the selective inversion operations using two ancilla qubits, and irreversible measurement operations on the ancilla qubits drive the starting state towards the target state. Using $q$ oracle queries, these variations reduce the probability of finding a non-target state from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{2q+1}$, which is asymptotically optimal. Similar ideas can lead to robust quantum algorithms, and provide conceptually new schemes for error correction.

<p><strong>8.    Investigation of Continuous-Time Quantum Walk Via Modules of Bose-Mesner and Terwilliger Algebras</strong><br>
M. A. Jafarizadeh, S. Salimi<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603139">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603139</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The continuous-time quantum walk on the underlying graphs of association schemes have been studied, via the algebraic combinatorics structures of association schemes, namely semi-simple modules of their Bose-Mesner and (reference state dependent) Terwilliger algebras. By choosing the (walk) starting site as a reference state, the Terwilliger algebra connected with this choice turns the graph into the metric space, hence stratifies the graph into a (d+1) disjoint union of strata, where the amplitudes of observing the continuous-time quantum walk on all sites belonging to a given stratum are the same. In graphs of association schemes with known spectrum, the transition amplitudes and average probabilities are given in terms of dual eigenvalues of association schemes. As most of association schemes arise from finite groups, hence the continuous-time walk on generic group association schemes have been studied in great details, where the transition amplitudes are given in terms of characters of groups. Further investigated examples are the walk on graphs of association schemes of symmetric $S_n$, Dihedral $D_{2m}$ and cyclic groups. Also, following Ref.\cite{js}, the spectral distributions connected to the highest irreducible representations of Terwilliger algebras of some rather important graphs, namely distance regular graphs, have been presented. Then using spectral distribution, the amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on graphs such as cycle graph $C_n$, Johnson and normal subgroup graphs have been evaluated. {\bf Keywords: Continuous-time quantum walk, Association scheme, Bose-Mesner algebra, Terwilliger algebra, Spectral distribution, Distance regular graph.} {\bf PACs Index: 03.65.Ud}

<p><strong>9.    Is Grover&#39;s Algorithm a Quantum Hidden Subgroup Algorithm ?</strong><br>
Samuel J. Lomonaco, Jr., Louis H. Kauffman<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603140">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603140</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The arguments given in this paper suggest that Grover&#39;s and Shor&#39;s algorithms are more closely related than one might at first expect. Specifically, we show that Grover&#39;s algorithm can be viewed as a quantum algorithm which solves a non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP). But we then go on to show that the standard non-abelian quantum hidden subgroup (QHS) algorithm can not find a solution to this particular HSP. This leaves open the question as to whether or not there is some modification of the standard non-abelian QHS algorithm which is equivalent to Grover&#39;s algorithm.

<p><strong>10.    Single Photon Source Using Laser Pulses and Two-Photon Absorption</strong><br>
B.C. Jacobs, T.B. Pittman, J.D. Franson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603141">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603141</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We have previously shown that two-photon absorption (TPA) and the quantum Zeno effect can be used to make deterministic quantum logic devices from an otherwise linear optical system. Here we show that this type of quantum Zeno gate can be used with additional two-photon absorbing media and weak laser pulses to make a heralded single photon source. A source of this kind is expected to have a number of practical advantages that make it well suited for large scale quantum information processing applications.

<p><strong>11.    Analysis of a Quantum Nondemolition Measurement Scheme Based on Kerr Nonlinearity in Photonic Crystal Waveguides</strong><br>
Ilya Fushman, Jelena Vuckovic<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603150">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603150</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the feasibility of a quantum nondemolition measurement (QND) of photon number based on cross phase modulation due to the Kerr effect in Photonic Crystal Waveguides (PCWs). In particular, we derive the equations for two modes propagating in PCWs and their coupling by a third order nonlinearity. The reduced group velocity and small cross-sectional area of the PCW lead to an enhancement of the interaction relative to bulk materials. We show that in principle, such experiments may be feasible with current photonic technologies, although they are limited by material properties. Our analysis of the propagation equations is sufficiently general to be applicable to the study of soliton formation, all-optical switching and can be extended to processes involving other orders of the nonlinearity.

<p><strong>12.    Implementing the one-dimensional quantum (Hadamard) walk using a Bose-Einstein Condensate</strong><br>
C.M. Chandrashekar<br>
Phys. Rev. A . 74, 032307 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603156">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603156</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme to implement the simplest and best-studied version of quantum random walk, the discrete Hadamard walk, in one dimension using coherent macroscopic sample of ultracold atoms, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Implementation of quantum walk using BEC gives access to the familiar quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale. This paper uses rf pulse to implement Hadamard operation (rotation) and stimulated Raman transition technique as unitary shift operator. The scheme suggests implementation of Hadamard operation and unitary shift operator while the BEC is trapped in long Rayleigh range optical dipole trap. The Hadamard rotation and a unitary shift operator on BEC prepared in one of the internal state followed by a bit flip operation, implements one step of the Hadamard walk. To realize a sizable number of steps, the process is iterated without resorting to intermediate measurement. With current dipole trap technology it should be possible to implement enough steps to experimentally highlight the discrete quantum random walk using a BEC leading to further exploration of quantum random walks and its applications.

<p><strong>13.    On the simulation of quantum circuits</strong><br>
Richard Jozsa<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603163">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603163</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider recent works on the simulation of quantum circuits using the formalism of matrix product states and the formalism of contracting tensor networks. We provide simplified direct proofs of many of these results, extending an explicit class of efficiently simulable circuits (log depth circuits with 2-qubit gates of limited range) to the following: let C be any poly sized quantum circuit (generally of poly depth too) on n qubits comprising 1- and 2- qubit gates and 1-qubit measurements (with 2-qubit gates acting on arbitrary pairs of qubit lines). For each qubit line j let D_j be the number of 2-qubit gates that touch or cross the line j i.e. the number of 2-qubit gates that are applied to qubits i,k with i \leq j \leq k. Let D=max_j D_j. Then the quantum process can be classically simulated in time n poly(2^D). Thus if D=O(log n) then C may be efficiently classically simulated.

The measurements were made using spectral hole burning techniques at temperatures below 4 K. We measured an effective Stark coefficient $(\Delta\mu</em>{e}\chi)/(h)=25\pm1$kHz/Vcm$^{-1}$ in the crystalline waveguide and $(\bar{\Delta\mu_{e}}\chi)/(h)=15\pm1$kHz/Vcm$^{-1}$ in the silicate fiber.

<p><strong>16.    Computational complexity of the quantum separability problem</strong><br>
Lawrence M. Ioannou<br>
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 7, No. 4 (2007) 335-370<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603199">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603199</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ever since entanglement was identified as a computational and cryptographic resource, researchers have sought efficient ways to tell whether a given density matrix represents an unentangled, or separable, state. This paper gives the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of this (bipartite) quantum separability problem, focusing on its deterministic (as opposed to randomized) computational complexity. First, I review the one-sided tests for separability, paying particular attention to the semidefinite programming methods. Then, I discuss various ways of formulating the quantum separability problem, from exact to approximate formulations, the latter of which are the paper&#39;s main focus. I then give a thorough treatment of the problem&#39;s relationship with the complexity classes NP, NP-complete, and co-NP. I also discuss extensions of Gurvits&#39; NP-hardness result to strong NP-hardness of certain related problems. A major open question is whether the NP-contained formulation (QSEP) of the quantum separability problem is Karp-NP-complete; QSEP may be the first natural example of a problem that is Turing-NP-complete but not Karp-NP-complete. Finally, I survey all the proposed (deterministic) algorithms for the quantum separability problem, including the bounded search for symmetric extensions (via semidefinite programming), based on the recent quantum de Finetti theorem; and the entanglement-witness search (via interior-point algorithms and global optimization). These two algorithms have the lowest complexity, with the latter being the best under advice of asymptotically optimal point-coverings of the sphere.

<p><strong>17.    Gravitational quantum states of neutrons in a rough waveguide</strong><br>
A. E. Meyerovich, V. V. Nesvizhevsky<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603203">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603203</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A theory of gravitational quantum states of ultracold neutrons in waveguides with absorbing/scattering walls is presented. The theory covers recent experiments in which the ultracold neutrons were beamed between a mirror and a rough scatterer/absorber. The analysis is based on a recently developed theory of quantum transport along random rough walls which is modified in order to include leaky (absorbing) interfaces and, more importantly, the low-amplitude high-aperture roughness. The calculations are focused on a regime when the direct transitions into the continuous spectrum above the absorption threshold dominate the depletion of neutrons from the gravitational states and are more efficient than the processes involving the intermediate states. The theoretical results for the neutron count are sensitive to the correlation radius (lateral size) of surface inhomogeneities and to the ratio of the particle energy to the absorption threshold in a weak roughness limit. The main impediment for observation of the higher gravitational states is the &quot;overhang&quot; of the particle wave functions which can be overcome only by use scatterers with strong roughness. In general, the strong roughness with high amplitude is preferable if one wants just to detect the individual gravitational states, while the strong roughness experiments with small amplitude and high aperture are preferable for the quantitative analysis of the data. We also discuss the ways to further improve the accuracy of calculations and to optimize the experimental regime.

<p>
In this summary we discuss two new algorithms for Grover&#39;s unsorted database search problem that claimed to have reached exponential speedup over Grover&#39;s original algorithm. One is in the quantum setting with &quot;power queries&quot; that allow for exponential reduction in the number of queries over Grover&#39;s original algorithm with &quot;bit queries&quot;. The other is to use &quot;dubit queries&quot; on a duality computer - a new computing model uses a quantum system&#39;s wave-particle duality, which is able to achieve even greater computing power and better capability than existent quantum computers we have been discussing. We discuss the shortages and difficulties of both schemes as well.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603221">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603221</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a method that enables strong, coherent coupling between individual optical emitters and electromagnetic excitations in conducting nano-structures. The excitations are optical plasmons that can be localized to sub-wavelength dimensions. Under realistic conditions, the tight confinement causes optical emission to be almost entirely directed into the propagating plasmon modes via a mechanism analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics. We first illustrate this result for the case of a nanowire, before considering the optimized geometry of a nanotip. We describe an application of this technique involving efficient single-photon generation on demand, in which the plasmons are efficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide. Finally we analyze the effects of increased scattering due to surface roughness on these nano-structures.

<p><strong>20.    On Protected Realizations of Quantum Information</strong><br>
E. Knill<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603252">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603252</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are two complementary approaches to realizing quantum information so that it is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding information by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information. We give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the &quot;subsystems principle&quot; for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult. Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.
