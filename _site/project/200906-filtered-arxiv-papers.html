    <p><strong>1.    Symmetric extendibility for qudits and tolerable error rates in quantum cryptography</strong><br>
Kedar S. Ranade<br>
Phys. Rev. A 80 (No. 2, August 2009), 022301<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Symmetric extendibility of quantum states has recently drawn attention in the context of quantum cryptography to judge whether quantum states shared between two distant parties can be purified by means of one-way error correction protocols. In this letter we study the symmetric extendibility in a specific class of two-qudit states, i. e. states composed of two d-level systems, in order to find upper bounds on tolerable error rates for a wide class of qudit-based quantum cryptographic protocols using two-way error correction. In important cases these bounds coincide with previously known lower bounds, thereby proving sharpness of these bounds in arbitrary finite-dimensional systems.

<p><strong>2.    Classical Processing Requirements for a Topological Quantum Computing System</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dedicated research into the design and construction of a large scale Quantum Information Processing (QIP) system is a complicated task. The design of an experimentally feasible quantum processor must draw upon results in multiple fields; from experimental efforts in system control and fabrication through to far more abstract areas such as quantum algorithms and error correction. Recently, the adaptation of topological coding models to physical systems in optics has illustrated a possible long term pathway to truly large scale QIP. As the topological model has well defined protocols for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) built in as part of its construction, a more grounded analysis of the {\em classical} processing requirements is possible. In this paper we analyze the requirements for a classical processing system, designed specifically for the topological cluster state model. We demonstrate that via extensive parallelization, the construction of a classical &quot;front-end&quot; system capable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is possible today.

<p><strong>3.    Dynamical Quantum Error Correction of Unitary Operations with Bounded Controls</strong><br>
Kaveh Khodjasteh, Lorenza Viola<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dynamically corrected gates were recently introduced [Khodjasteh and Viola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 080501 (2009)] as a tool to achieve decoherence-protected quantum gates based on open-loop Hamiltonian engineering. Here, we further expand the framework of dynamical quantum error correction, with emphasis on elucidating under what conditions decoherence suppression can be ensured while performing a generic target quantum gate, using only available bounded-strength control resources. Explicit constructions for physically relevant error models are detailed, including arbitrary linear decoherence and pure dephasing on qubits. The effectiveness of dynamically corrected gates in an illustrative non-Markovian spin-bath setting is investigated numerically, confirming the expected fidelity performance in a wide parameter range. Robutness against a class of systematic control errors is automatically incorporated in the perturbative error regime.

<p><strong>4.    A Soliton Model of the Electron with an internal Nonlinearity cancelling the de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Potential</strong><br>
Roald Ekholdt<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0598">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0598</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron that propagates as a protuberance on a fictitious waveguide, which acts as trajectory. The model is based on de Broglie&#39;s original electron wave-particle relativistic theory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the propagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger equation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for practical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived corpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles Penrose&#39;s picture of Dirac&#39;s electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined by a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity cancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction is confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the wavefunction is eliminated. Since the electron model is based directly on the Special theory of relativity it also illustrates that theory. The corpuscle, incorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further study relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual coupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested. One of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic external fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves helically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have one polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the concept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum Pseudo-fractional Fourier Transform and its application to quantum phase estimation</strong><br>
Srinivas V. Parasa, K. Eswaran<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1033">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1033</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
- In this paper we present a method to compute the coefficients of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) on a quantum computer using quantum gates of polynomial complexity of the order O(n^3). The FrFt, a generalization of the DFT, has wide applications in signal processing and is particularly useful to implement the Pseudopolar and Radon transforms. Even though the FrFT is a non-unitary operation, to develop its quantum counterpart, we develop a unitary operator called the quantum Pseudo-fraction Fourier Transform (QPFrFT) in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space, in order to computer the coefficients of the FrFT. In this process we develop a unitary operator denoted U by which is an essential step to implement the QPFrFT. We then show the application of the operator U in the problem of quantum phase estimation.

<p>
We discuss the Ping-Pong protocol which was proposed by Bostroem and Felbinger. We derive a simple trade-off inequality between distinguishability of messages for Eve and detectability of Eve for legitimate users. Our inequality holds for arbitrary initial states. That is, even if Eve prepares an initial state, she cannot distinguish messages without being detected. We show that the same inequality holds also on another protocol in which Alice and Bob use one-way quantum communication channel twice.

<p><strong>9.    Distributed Quantum Computation Architecture Using Semiconductor Nanophotonics</strong><br>
Rodney Van Meter, Thaddeus D. Ladd, Austin G. Fowler, Yoshihisa Yamamoto<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2686">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2686</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a large-scale quantum computer, the cost of communications will dominate the performance and resource requirements, place many severe demands on the technology, and constrain the architecture. Unfortunately, fault-tolerant computers based entirely on photons with probabilistic gates, though equipped with &quot;built-in&quot; communication, have very large resource overheads; likewise, computers with reliable probabilistic gates between photons or quantum memories may lack sufficient communication resources in the presence of realistic optical losses. Here, we consider a compromise architecture, in which semiconductor spin qubits are coupled by bright laser pulses through nanophotonic waveguides and cavities using a combination of frequent probabilistic and sparse determinstic entanglement mechanisms. The large photonic resource requirements incurred by the use of probabilistic gates for quantum communication are mitigated in part by the potential high-speed operation of the semiconductor nanophotonic hardware. The system employs topological cluster-state quantum error correction for achieving fault-tolerance. Our results suggest that such an architecture/technology combination has the potential to scale to a system capable of attacking classically intractable computational problems.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles and linear optics</strong><br>
Nicolas Sangouard, Christoph Simon, Hugues de Riedmatten, Nicolas Gisin<br>
Rev. Mod. Phys; 83, 33 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2699">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2699</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The distribution of quantum states over long distances is limited by photon loss. Straightforward amplification as in classical telecommunications is not an option in quantum communication because of the no-cloning theorem. This problem could be overcome by implementing quantum repeater protocols, which create long-distance entanglement from shorter-distance entanglement via entanglement swapping. Such protocols require the capacity to create entanglement in a heralded fashion, to store it in quantum memories, and to swap it. One attractive general strategy for realizing quantum repeaters is based on the use of atomic ensembles as quantum memories, in combination with linear optical techniques and photon counting to perform all required operations. Here we review the theoretical and experimental status quo of this very active field. We compare the potential of different approaches quantitatively, with a focus on the most immediate goal of outperforming the direct transmission of photons.

We consider quantum walks on a finite graphs to which infinite tails are attached. We explore how the propagating and bound states depend on the structure of the finite graph. The S-matrix for such graphs is defined. Its unitarity is proved as well as some other of its properties such as its transformation under time reversal. A spectral decomposition of the identity for the Hamiltonian of the graph is derived using its eigenvectors. We derive formulas for the S-matrix of a graph under certain operation such as cutting a tail, attaching a tail or connecting two tails to form an edge.

<p><strong>12.    Randomized Dynamical Decoupling Strategies and Improved One-Way Key Rates for Quantum Cryptography</strong><br>
Oliver Kern<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2927">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2927</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The present thesis deals with various methods of quantum error correction. It is divided into two parts. In the first part, dynamical decoupling methods are considered which have the task of suppressing the influence of residual imperfections in a quantum memory. The suppression is achieved by altering the dynamics of an imperfect quantum memory with the help of a sequence of local unitary operations applied to the qudits. Whereas up to now the operations of such decoupling sequences have been constructed in a deterministic fashion, strategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by random selection from a suitable set. Furthermore, it is investigated if and how the discussed decoupling strategies can be employed to protect a quantum computation running on the quantum memory. The second part of the thesis deals with quantum error-correcting codes and protocols for quantum key distribution. The focus is on the BB84 and the 6-state protocol making use of only one-way communication during the error correction and privacy amplification steps. It is shown that by adding additional errors to the preliminary key (a process called noisy preprocessing) followed by the use of a structured block code, higher secure key rates may be obtained. For the BB84 protocol it is shown that iterating the combined preprocessing leads to an even higher gain.

<p>
We study a natural construction of a general class of inhomogeneous quantum walks (namely walks whose transition probabilities depend on position). Within the class we analyze walks that are periodic in position and show that, depending on the period, such walks can be bounded or unbounded in time; in the latter case we analyze the asymptotic speed. We compare the construction to others in the existing literature. As an example we give a quantum version of a non-irreducible classical walk: the Polya Urn.

<p>
We show theoretically and experimentally that scattered light by thermal phonons inside a second-order nonlinear crystal is the source of additional phase noise observed in Optical Parametric Oscillators. This additional phase noise reduces the quantum correlations and has hitherto hindered the direct production of multipartite entanglement in a single nonlinear optical system. We cooled the nonlinear crystal and observed a reduction of the extra noise. Our treatment of this noise can be successfully applied to different systems in the literature.

<p><strong>15.    Complex WKB Evolution of Markovian Open Systems</strong><br>
O. Brodier, A. M. Ozorio de Almeida<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4288">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4288</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We derive a semiclassical approximation for the evolution generated by the Lindblad equation as a generalization of complex WKB theory. Linear coupling to the environment is assumed, but the Hamiltonian can be a general function of positions and momenta. The theory is carried out in the chord representation and describes the evolved quantum characteristic function, which gives direct access to the Wigner function and the position representation of the density operator by Fourier transforms. The propagation is shown to be of Liouville type in a complex double phase space, the imaginary part of the action being responsible for decoherence. The theory is exact in the quadratic case, just as the real WKB theory that we previously developed for the Markovian evolution of extended states, but it also describes the decoherent and dissipative evolution of localized states, such as the interference terms of a Schr\&quot;odinger cat state. The present rederivation of the real WKB approximation leads to its interpretation as a first order classical perturbation of the complex theory and to a discussion of its validity. The example of a simple cubic Hamiltonian illustrates the various levels of approximation derived from the complex WKB theory.

<blockquote>
<p>
Silicon waveguides are promising $\chi^3$-based photon pair sources. Demonstrations so far have been based on picosecond pulsed lasers. Here, we present the first investigation of photon pair generation in silicon waveguides in a continuous regime. The source is characterized by coincidence measurements. We uncover the presence of unexpected noise which had not been noticed in earlier experiments. Subsequently, we present advances towards integration of the photon pair source with other components on the chip. This is demonstrated by photon pair generation in a Sagnac loop interferometer and inside a micro-ring cavity. Comparison with the straight waveguide shows that these are promising avenues for improving the source. In particular photon pair generation in the micro-ring cavity yields a source with a spectral width of approximately 150 pm resulting in a spectral brightness increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude.

We investigate the particle trapping and scattering properties in a tight-binding network which consists of several subgraphs. The particle trapping condition is proved under which particles can be trapped in a subgraph without leaking. Based on exact solutions for the configuration of a $\pi$-shaped lattice, it is argued that the bound states in a specified subgraph are of two types, resonant and evanescent. It is also shown that, when such a subgraph is embedded in a one-dimensional chain as the waveguide, an incident wave experiences total reflection if its energy matches the resonant bound state energy.

If the dynamics of an open quantum systems is non-Markovian, its {asymptotic} state strongly depends on the initial conditions, even if the dynamics possesses an {invariant} state. This is the very essence of memory effects. In particular, the {asymptotic} state can remember and partially preserve its initial entanglement. Interestingly, even if the non-Markovian evolution relaxes to an equilibrium state, this state needs not be invariant. Therefore, the non-invariance of equilibrium becomes a clear sign of non-Markovianity.

<p>
Our preceding paper introduced a method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries and for arbitrary materials that was based on a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme. In this manuscript, we focus on the efficient implementation of our method for geometries of practical interest and extend our previous proof-of-concept algorithm in one dimension to problems in two and three dimensions, introducing a number of new optimizations. We consider Casimir piston-like problems with nonmonotonic and monotonic force dependence on sidewall separation, both for previously solved geometries to validate our method and also for new geometries involving magnetic sidewalls and/or cylindrical pistons. We include realistic dielectric materials to calculate the force between suspended silicon waveguides or on a suspended membrane with periodic grooves, also demonstrating the application of PML absorbing boundaries and/or periodic boundaries. In addition we apply this method to a realizable three-dimensional system in which a silica sphere is stably suspended in a fluid above an indented metallic substrate. More generally, the method allows off-the-shelf FDTD software, already supporting a wide variety of materials (including dielectric, magnetic, and even anisotropic materials) and boundary conditions, to be exploited for the Casimir problem.

<p>
We theoretically study a circuit QED architecture based on a superconducting flux qubit directly coupled to the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide transmission-line resonator. As already shown experimentally [Abdumalikov et al. Phys. Rev. B 78, 180502 (2008)], the strong coupling regime of cavity QED can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage of the the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity QED where the rotating-wave approximation breaks down. This should allow an on-chip implementation of the E x B Jahn-Teller model.

We address frequency-dependent quantum transport through mesoscopic conductors in the semiclassical limit. By generalizing the trajectory-based semiclassical theory of dc quantum transport to the ac case, we derive the average screened conductance as well as ac weak-localization corrections for chaotic conductors. Thereby we confirm respective random matrix results and generalize them by accounting for Ehrenfest time effects. We consider the case of a cavity connected through many leads to a macroscopic circuit which contains ac-sources. In addition to the reservoir the cavity itself is capacitively coupled to a gate. By incorporating tunnel barriers between cavity and leads we obtain results for arbitrary tunnel rates. Finally, based on our findings we investigate the effect of dephasing on the charge relaxation resistance of a mesoscopic capacitor in the linear low-frequency regime.

We investigate the dynamical Casimir effect in a coplanar waveguide (CPW) terminated by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID).

Effective boundary velocities comparable to the speed of light in the CPW result in broadband photon generation which is identical to the one calculated in the dynamical Casimir effect for a single oscillating mirror. We estimate the power of the radiation for realistic parameters and show that it is experimentally feasible to directly detect this nonclassical broadband radiation.

We develop the theory of a metamaterial composed of an array of discrete quantum absorbers inside a one-dimensional waveguide that implements a high-efficiency microwave photon detector. A basic design consists of a few metastable superconducting nanocircuits spread inside and coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide in a circuit QED setup. The arrival of a {\it propagating} quantum microwave field induces an irreversible change in the population of the internal levels of the absorbers, due to a selective absorption of photon excitations. This design is studied using a formal but simple quantum field theory, which allows us to evaluate the single-photon absorption efficiency for one and many absorber setups. As an example, we consider a particular design that combines a coplanar coaxial waveguide with superconducting phase qubits, a natural but not exclusive playground for experimental implementations. This work and a possible experimental realization may stimulate the possible arrival of &quot;all-optical&quot; quantum information processing with propagating quantum microwaves, where a microwave photodetector could play a key role.
