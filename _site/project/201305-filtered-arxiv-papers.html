<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally demonstrate optomechanical motion and force measurements near the quantum precision limits set by the quantum Cram\&#39;er-Rao bounds (QCRBs). Optical beams in coherent and phase-squeezed states are used to measure the motion of a mirror under an external stochastic force. Utilizing optical phase tracking and quantum smoothing techniques, we achieve position, momentum, and force estimation accuracies close to the QCRBs with the coherent state, while estimation using squeezed states shows clear quantum enhancements beyond the coherent-state bounds.

<p><strong>2.    A quantum non-Markovian collision model: incoherent swap case</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We have recently presented a collision-model-based framework to approach non-Markovian quantum dynamics [Ciccarello F Palma G M and Giovannetti V 2013 Phys. Rev. A 87, 040103(R)]. As a distinctive feature, memory is introduced in a dynamical way by adding extra inter-ancillary collisions to a standard (memoryless) collision model. Here, we focus on the case where such intra-bath collisions are described by incoherent partial swap operations. After briefly reviewing the model, we show how to include temperature as an additional parameter by relaxing the assumption that each bath ancilla is initially in a pure state. We also calculate explicitly the dynamical map entailed by the master equation in the paradigmatic instance of a Jaynes-Cummings system-ancilla coupling.

<p>
We schedule the Steane [[7,1,3]] error correction on a model ion trap architecture with ballistic transport. We compare the level one error rates for syndrome extraction using the Shor method of ancilla prepared in verified cat states to the DiVincenzo-Aliferis method without verification. The study examines how the quantum error correction circuit latency and error vary with the number of available ancilla and the choice of protocol for ancilla preparation and measurement. We find that with few exceptions the DiVincenzo-Aliferis method without cat state verification outperforms the standard Shor method. We also find that additional ancilla always reduces the latency but does not significantly change the error due to the high memory fidelity.

We study optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits, and apply the results to peep-hole optimization of quantum circuits. We report optimal circuits for all Clifford operations with up to four inputs. We perform peep-hole optimization of Clifford circuits with up to 40 inputs found in the literature, and demonstrate the reduction in the number of gates by about 50%. We extend our methods to the optimal synthesis of linear reversible circuits, partially specified Clifford functions, and optimal Clifford circuits with five inputs up to input/output permutation. The results find their application in randomized benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit optimization.

We present three new quantum algorithms in the quantum query model for \textsc{graph-collision} problem: \begin{itemize} \item an algorithm based on tree decomposition that uses $O\left(\sqrt{n}t^{\sfrac{1}{6}}\right)$ queries where $t$ is the treewidth of the graph; \item an algorithm constructed on a span program that improves a result by Gavinsky and Ito. The algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{\alpha^{<strong>}})$ queries, where $\alpha^{</strong>}(G)$ is a graph parameter defined by [\alpha^{**}(G):=\min_{VC\text{-- vertex cover of}G}{\max_{\substack{I\subseteq VC\I\text{-- independent set}}}{\sum_{v\in I}{\deg{v}}}};] \item an algorithm for a subclass of circulant graphs that uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ queries. \end{itemize} We also present an example of a possibly difficult graph $G$ for which all the known graphs fail to solve graph collision in $O(\sqrt{n} \log^c n)$ queries.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study distribution schemes for a polarization entangled photon pair based on a decoherence-free subspace over lossy quantum channels and propose an efficient scheme that is robust against not only collective phase noises but also general collective noises for two qubits. While the proposed scheme employs two photons to build the decoherence-free subspace, the success probability is proportional to the channel transmittance of a single photon with the aid of a counter-propagating weak coherent light pulse. The key ingredient in the scheme is found to be the reciprocity of the channel. The proposed scheme shares the rest of the properties with the previously proposed schemes, i.e., it can be realized by linear optical elements and it is robust against the fluctuations in the optical circuits used by the two parties.

<p>
The quantum version of Google PageRank has recently been investigated by various groups and shown to be quadratically faster in time than the classical PageRank algorithm. In this paper we propose the implementation of Quantum PageRank by a stochastic quantum walk of correlated photons in a photonic waveguide lattice, where we allow the density matrix to evolve according to the Lindblad-Kossakowski master equation. This yields a stationary state, the diagonal of whose density matrix gives the page ranking.

<p><strong>8.    Negativity and steering: a stronger Peres conjecture</strong><br>
Matthew F. Pusey<br>
Phys. Rev. A 88, 032313 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1767">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1767</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The violation of a Bell inequality certifies the presence of entanglement even if neither party trusts their measurement devices. Recently Moroder et. al. showed how to make this statement quantitative, using semidefinite programming to calculate how much entanglement is certified by a given violation. Here I adapt their techniques to the case where Bob&#39;s measurement devices are in fact trusted, the setting for &quot;EPR-steering&quot; inequalities. Interestingly, all of the steering inequalities studied turn out to require negativity for their violation. This supports a significant strengthening of Peres&#39; conjecture that negativity is required to violate a bipartite Bell inequality.

<p><strong>9.    Temporal mode selectivity by frequency conversion in second-order nonlinear optical waveguides</strong><br>
Dileep V. Reddy, Michael G. Raymer, Colin J. McKinstrie, Lasse Mejling, Karsten Rottwitt<br>
Optics Express, Vol. 21, Issue 11, pp. 13840-13863 (2013)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2165">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2165</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore theoretically the feasibility of using frequency conversion by sum- or difference-frequency generation, enabled by three- wave-mixing, for selectively multiplexing orthogonal input waveforms that overlap in time and frequency. Such a process would enable a drop device for use in a transparent optical network using temporally orthogonal waveforms to encode different channels. We model the process using coupled-mode equations appropriate for wave mixing in a uniform second- order nonlinear optical medium pumped by a strong laser pulse. We find Green functions describing the process, and employ Schmidt (singular- value) decompositions thereof to quantify its viability in functioning as a coherent waveform discriminator. We define a selectivity figure of merit in terms of the Schmidt coefficients, and use it to compare and contrast various parameter regimes via extensive numerical computations. We identify the most favorable regime (at least in the case of no pump chirp) and derive the complete analytical solution for the same. We bound the maximum achievable selectivity in this parameter space. We show that including a frequency chirp in the pump does not improve selectivity in this optimal regime. We also find an operating regime in which high-efficiency frequency conversion without temporal-shape selectivity can be achieved while preserving the shapes of a wide class of input pulses. The results are applicable to both classical and quantum frequency conversion.

<p><strong>10.    Squeezed light in an optical parametric oscillator network with coherent feedback quantum control</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2239">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2239</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present squeezing and anti-squeezing spectra of the output from a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO) network arranged in different coherent quantum feedback configurations. One OPO serves as a quantum plant, the other as a quantum controller. The addition of coherent feedback enables shaping of the output squeezing spectrum of the plant, and is found to be capable of pushing the frequency of maximum squeezing away from the optical driving frequency and broadening the spectrum over a wider frequency band. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the developed theory, and illustrate the use of coherent quantum feedback to engineer the quantum-optical properties of the plant OPO output.

<p><strong>11.    Quantum Error Correction Implementation after Multiple Gates</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2763">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2763</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Correcting errors is a vital but expensive component of fault tolerant quantum computation. Standard fault tolerant protocol assumes the implementation of error correction, via syndrome measurements and possible recovery operations, after every quantum gate. In fact, this is not necessary. Here we demonstrate that error correction should be applied more sparingly. We simulate encoded single-qubit rotations within the [[7,1,3]] code and show via fidelity measures that applying error correction after every gate is not desirable.

<p>
We perform a comprehensive set of experiments that characterize bosonic bunching of up to 3 photons in interferometers of up to 16 modes. Our experiments verify two rules that govern bosonic bunching. The first rule, obtained recently in [1,2], predicts the average behavior of the bunching probability and is known as the bosonic birthday paradox. The second rule is new, and establishes a n!-factor quantum enhancement for the probability that all n bosons bunch in a single output mode, with respect to the case of distinguishable bosons. Besides its fundamental importance in phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation, bosonic bunching can be exploited in applications such as linear optical quantum computing and quantum-enhanced metrology.

We present a scheme for linear optical quantum computing using time-bin encoded qubits in a single spatial mode.

Our scheme is suited to available photonic devices and ideally allows arbitrary numbers of qubits to be encoded in the same spatial mode, demonstrating the potential for time-frequency modes to dramatically increase the quantum information capacity of fixed spatial resources. As a test of our scheme, we demonstrate the first entirely single spatial mode implementation of a two-qubit quantum gate and show its operation with an average fidelity of 0.84+-0.07.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3813">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3813</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate propagation of few-photon pulses in waveguides coupled to a two-level system by means of the method of distribution functions in coordinate-momentum space that provides a detailed description of photon systems. We find that the distribution function of the transmitted pulse can be negative for the nonclassical input (i.e., single-photon Fock state). This reveals the quasiprobability nature of photon distribution. Analytical expressions for photon densities in the momentum space as well as in the coordinate space are obtained for the mentioned single-photon Gaussian input. We also study evolution of the multimode coherent-state input for an arbitrary photon number. Time-dependent differential equations describing average densities and fluctuations of outgoing photons are derived and solved. Influence of the number of input photons, pulse width, and radiation-atom interaction strength on the statistical properties of the fluctuations is investigated.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the entanglement between the internal (spin) and external (position) degrees of freedom of a qubit in a random (dynamically disordered) one-dimensional discrete time quantum random walk (QRW) achieves its maximal possible value asymptotically in the number of steps, outperforming the entanglement attained by using ordered QRW. The disorder is modeled by introducing an extra random aspect to QRW, a classical coin that randomly dictates which quantum coin drives the system&#39;s time evolution. We also show that maximal entanglement is achieved independently of the initial state of the walker, study the number of steps the system must move to be within a small fixed neighborhood of its asymptotic limit, and propose two experiments where these ideas can be tested.

We apply our formalism to two settings of current experimental interest based on the archetype M\&quot;ossbauer isotope 57Fe. For present experimental conditions, we derive compact analytical expressions and show that the alignment of medium magnetization as well as incident and detection polarization enable the engineering advanced quantum optical level schemes. The model encompasses non-linear and quantum effects which could become accessible in future experiments.

Houri Ziaeepour<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4349">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4349</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider symmetry as a foundational concept in quantum mechanics and rewrite quantum mechanics and measurement axioms in this description. We argue that issues related to measurements and physical reality of states can be better understood in this view. In particular, the abstract concept of symmetry provides a basis-independent definition for observables. Moreover, we show that the apparent projection/collapse of the state as the final step of measurement or decoherence is the result of breaking of symmetries. This phenomenon is comparable with a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and makes the process of decoherence and classicality a natural fate of complex systems consisting of many interacting subsystems. Additionally, we demonstrate that the property of state space as a vector space representing symmetries is more fundamental than being an abstract Hilbert space, and its $L2$ integrability can be obtained from the imposed condition of being a representation of a symmetry group and general properties of probability distributions.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Algorithms have long captured the imagination of computer scientists and physicists primarily because of the speed up achieved by them over their classical counterparts using principles of quantum mechanics. Entanglement is believed to be the primary phenomena behind this speed up. However their precise role in quantum algorithms is yet unclear. In this article, we explore the nature of entanglement in the Grover&#39;s search algorithm. This algorithm enables searching of elements from an unstructured database quadratically faster than the best known classical algorithm. Geometric measure of entanglement has been used to quantify and analyse entanglement across iterations of the algorithm. We reveal how the entanglement varies with increase in the number of qubits and also with the number of marked or solution states. Numerically, it is seen that the behaviour of the maximum value of entanglement is monotonous with the number of qubits. Also, for a given value of the number of qubits, a change in the marked states alters the amount of entanglement. The amount of entanglement in the final state of the algorithm has been shown to depend solely on the nature of the marked states. Explicit analytical expressions are given showing the variation of entanglement with the number of iterations and the global maximum value of entanglement attained across all iterations of the algorithm.

<p>
Knill demonstrated a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme based on concatenated error-detecting codes and postselection with a simulated error threshold of 3% over the depolarizing channel. %We design a two-dimensional architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on Knill&#39;s postselection scheme. We show how to use Knill&#39;s postselection scheme in a practical two-dimensional quantum architecture that we designed with the goal to optimize the error correction properties, while satisfying important architectural constraints. In our 2D architecture, one logical qubit is embedded in a tile consisting of $5\times 5$ physical qubits. The movement of these qubits is modeled as noisy SWAP gates and the only physical operations that are allowed are local one- and two-qubit gates. We evaluate the practical properties of our design, such as its error threshold, and compare it to the concatenated Bacon-Shor code and the concatenated Steane code. Assuming that all gates have the same error rates, we obtain a threshold of $3.06\times 10^{-4}$ in a local adversarial stochastic noise model, which is the highest known error threshold for concatenated codes in 2D. We also present a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D architecture with depolarizing noise and we calculate a pseudo-threshold of about 0.1%. With memory error rates one-tenth of the worst gate error rates, the threshold for the adversarial noise model, and the pseudo-threshold over depolarizing noise, are $4.06\times 10^{-4}$ and 0.2%, respectively. In a hypothetical technology where memory error rates are negligible, these thresholds can be further increased by shrinking the tiles into a $4\times 4$ layout.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this theoretical study, we analyze quantum walks on complex networks, which model network-based processes ranging from quantum computing to biology and even sociology. Specifically, we analytically relate the average long time probability distribution for the location of a unitary quantum walker to that of a corresponding classical walker. The distribution of the classical walker is proportional to the distribution of degrees, which measures the connectivity of the network nodes and underlies many methods for analyzing classical networks including website ranking. The quantum distribution becomes exactly equal to the classical distribution when the walk has zero energy and at higher energies the difference, the so-called quantumness, is bounded by the energy of the initial state. We give an example for which the quantumness equals a Renyi entropy of the normalized weighted degrees, guiding us to regimes for which the classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others for which quantum effects dominate.

<blockquote>
<p>
Clifford gates are a winsome class of quantum operations combining mathematical elegance with physical significance. The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that Clifford computations can be classically efficiently simulated but this is true only in a suitably restricted setting. Here we consider Clifford computations with a variety of additional ingredients: (a) strong vs. weak simulation, (b) inputs being computational basis states vs. general product states, (c) adaptive vs. non-adaptive choices of gates for circuits involving intermediate measurements, (d) single line outputs vs. multi-line outputs. We consider the classical simulation complexity of all combinations of these ingredients and show that many are not classically efficiently simulatable (subject to common complexity assumptions such as P not equal to NP). Our results reveal a surprising proximity of classical to quantum computing power viz. a class of classically simulatable quantum circuits which yields universal quantum computation if extended by a purely classical additional ingredient that does not extend the class of quantum processes occurring.

<p>
The integrated optical circuit is a promising architecture for the realization of complex quantum optical states and information networks. One element that is required for many of these applications is a high-efficiency photon detector capable of photon-number discrimination. We present an integrated photonic system in the telecom band at 1550 nm based on UV-written silica-on-silicon waveguides and modified transition-edge sensors capable of number resolution and over 40% efficiency. Exploiting the mode transmission failure of these devices, we multiplex three detectors in series to demonstrate a combined 79% +/- 2% detection efficiency with a single pass, and 88% +/- 3% at the operating wavelength of an on-chip terminal reflection grating. Furthermore, our optical measurements clearly demonstrate no significant unexplained loss in this system due to scattering or reflections. This waveguide and detector design therefore allows the placement of number-resolving single-photon detectors of predictable efficiency at arbitrary locations within a photonic circuit - a capability that offers great potential for many quantum optical applications.

<p>
High dimensional quantum states are of fundamental interest for quantum information processing. They give access to large Hilbert spaces and, in turn, enable the encoding of quantum information on multiple modes. One method to create such quantum states is parametric down-conversion (PDC) in waveguide arrays (WGAs) which allows for the creation of highly entangled photon-pairs in controlled, easily accessible spatial modes, with unique spectral properties. In this paper we examine both theoretically and experimentally the PDC process in a lithium niobate WGA. We measure the spatial and spectral properties of the emitted photon-pairs, revealing strong correlations between spectral and spatial degrees of freedom of the created photons. Our measurements show that, in contrast to prior theoretical approaches, spectrally dependent coupling effects have to be taken into account in the theory of PDC in WGAs. To interpret the results, we developed a theoretical model specifically taking into account spectrally dependent coupling effects, which further enables us to explore the capabilities and limitations for engineering the spatial correlations of the generated quantum states.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the hitting time of the discrete quantum walk on a symmetric Cayley graph over $\Z_2^n $ from a vertex to its antipodal is polynomial in degree of the graph. We prove that returning time of quantum walk on a symmetric Cayley graph over $\Z_2^n $ is polynomial and the probability to hit is almost one. To prove it, we give a new estimation of Kravchuk coefficients. We give an example of a probabilistic polynomial algorithm that finds an antipodal vertex in symmetric Cayley graphs.

<blockquote>
<p>
At the heart of understanding the emergence of a classical world from quantum theory is the insight that all macroscopic quantum systems are to some extent coupled to an environment and hence are open systems. The associated loss of quantum coherence, i.e. decoherence, is also detrimental for quantum information processing applications. In contrast, properly engineered quantum noise can counteract decoherence and can even be used in robust quantum state generation. To exploit the detailed dynamics of a quantum system it is therefore crucial to obtain both good knowledge and control over its environment. An explicit modelling of the environment, however, may often not be possible. In this case, simplifying assumptions concerning the nature of the underlying quantum noise are being made that do not necessarily hold for real devices. Micro- and nano-mechanical resonators constitute prominent examples. They are now emerging as promising devices for quantum science. Because of their complex solid-state nature, the properties of their intrinsic decoherence mechanisms have been the subject of intense research for decades. Here we present a method to reconstruct the relevant properties of the environment, that is, its spectral density, of the centre of mass motion of a micro-mechanical oscillator. We observe a clear signature of non-Markovian Brownian motion, which is in contrast to the current paradigm to treat the thermal environment of mechanical quantum resonators as fully Markovian. The presented method, inspired by methods of system identification, can easily be transferred to other harmonic systems that are embedded in a complex environment, for example electronic or nuclear spin states in a solid state matrix. Our results also open up a route for mechanical quantum state engineering via coupling to unorthodox reservoirs.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the collective effects that emerge in waveguide quantum electrodynamics where several (artificial) atoms are coupled to a one-dimensional superconducting transmission line. Since single microwave photons can travel without loss for a long distance along the line, real and virtual photons emitted by one atom can be reabsorbed or scattered by a second atom. Depending on the distance between the atoms, this collective effect can lead to super- and subradiance or to a coherent exchange-type interaction between the atoms. Changing the artificial atoms transition frequencies, something which can be easily done with superconducting qubits (two levels artificial atoms), is equivalent to changing the atom-atom separation and thereby opens the possibility to study the characteristics of these collective effects. To study this waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, we extend previous work and present an effective master equation valid for an ensemble of inhomogeneous atoms driven by a coherent state. Using input-output theory, we compute analytically and numerically the elastic and inelastic scattering and show how these quantities reveal information about collective effects. These theoretical results are compatible with recent experimental results using transmon qubits coupled to a superconducting one-dimensional transmission line [A.~F.~van Loo {\it et al.}].

<blockquote>
<p>
The non-deterministic nature of photon sources is a key limitation for single photon quantum processors. Spatial multiplexing overcomes this by enhancing the heralded single photon yield without enhancing the output noise. Here the intrinsic statistical limit of an individual source is surpassed by spatially multiplexing two monolithic silicon correlated photon pair sources, demonstrating a 62.4% increase in the heralded single photon output without an increase in unwanted multi-pair generation. We further demonstrate the scalability of this scheme by multiplexing photons generated in two waveguides pumped via an integrated coupler with a 63.1% increase in the heralded photon rate. This demonstration paves the way for a scalable architecture for multiplexing many photon sources in a compact integrated platform and achieving efficient two photon interference, required at the core of optical quantum computing and quantum communication protocols.

We experimentally characterize Hopf bifurcation phenomena at femtojoule energy scales in a multi-atom cavity quantum electrodynamical (cavity QED) system, and demonstrate how such behaviors can be exploited in the design of all-optical memory and modulation devices. The data are analyzed using a semiclassical model that explicitly treats heterogeneous coupling of atoms to the cavity mode. Our results highlight the interest of cavity QED systems for ultra-low power photonic signal processing as well as for fundamental studies of mesoscopic nonlinear dynamics.

<blockquote>
<p>
Light propagation through an ensemble of ultra-cold Rydberg atoms in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) configuration is studied. In strongly interacting Rydberg EIT media, non-linear optical effects lead to a non-trivial dependence of the degree of probe beam attenuation on the medium density and on its initial intensity. We develop a Monte Carlo rate equation model that self-consistently includes the effect of the probe beam attenuation to investigate the steady state of the Rydberg medium driven by two laser fields. We compare our results to recent experimental data and to results of other state-of-the-art models for light propagation in Rydberg EIT-media. We find that for low probe field intensities, our results match the experimental data best if a density-dependent dephasing rate is included in the model. At higher probe intensities, our model deviates from other theoretical approaches, as it predicts a spectral asymmetry together with line broadening. These are likely due to off-resonant excitation channels, which however have not been observed in recent experiments. Atomic motion and coupling to additional Rydberg levels are discussed as possible origins for these deviations.

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the formalism of supersymmetry (SUSY), when applied to parity-time (PT) symmetric optical potentials, can give rise to novel refractive index landscapes with altogether non-trivial properties. In particular, we find that the presence of gain and loss allows for arbitrarily removing bound states from the spectrum of a structure. This is in stark contrast to the Hermitian case, where the SUSY formalism can only address the fundamental mode of a potential. Subsequently we investigate isospectral families of complex potentials that exhibit entirely real spectra, despite the fact that their shapes violate PT-symmetry. Finally, the role of SUSY transformations in the regime of spontaneously broken PT symmetry is investigated.

This limit theorem implies the weak convergence with linear scaling whose density has two delta measures at $x=0$ (the origin) and $x=1$ (the bottom) without continuous parts.

<p>
Over the last two decades, advances in fabrication have led to significant progress in creating patterned heterostructures that support either carriers, such as electrons or holes, with specific band structure or electromagnetic waves with a given mode structure and dispersion. In this article, we review the properties of light in coupled optical waveguides that support specific energy spectra, with or without the effects of disorder, that are well-described by a Hermitian tight-binding model. We show that with a judicious choice of the initial wave packet, this system displays the characteristics of a quantum particle, including transverse photonic transport and localization, and that of a classical particle. We extend the analysis to non-Hermitian, parity and time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric Hamiltonians which physically represent waveguide arrays with spatially separated, balanced absorption or amplification. We show that coupled waveguides are an ideal candidate to simulate $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians and the transition from a purely real energy spectrum to a spectrum with complex conjugate eigenvalues that occurs in them.

<blockquote>
<p>
The photonic bound state in the continuum (BIC) is discovered in a hybrid photonic circuit with low refractive index waveguide on a high refractive index thin membrane, where the optical dissipation is forbidden because of the destructive interference of different leakage channels. Based on the photonic BIC, the low mode area in a hybrid waveguide and high quality factor in a microresonator can be applied to enhance the light-matter interaction. Taking the fabrication-friendly polymer structure on diamond membrane as an example, those excellent optical performances can exist in a wide range of structure parameters with large fabrication tolerance and induce the strong coupling between photon and nitrogen-vacancy center in the diamond for scalable quantum information processors and networks. Such a fabrication-friendly structure with photonic BIC is also very promising in laser, nonlinear optical and quantum optical applications.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study quantum systems on a discrete bounded lattice (lattice billiards). The statistical properties of their spectra show universal features related to the regular or chaotic character of their classical continuum counterparts. However, the decay dynamics of the open systems appear very different from the continuum case, their properties being dominated by the states in the band center. We identify a class of states (&quot;lattice scars&quot;) that survive for infinite times in dissipative systems and that are degenerate at the center of the band. We provide analytical arguments for their existence in any bipartite lattice, and give a formula to determine their number. These states should be relevant to quantum transport in discrete systems, and we discuss how to observe them using photonic waveguides, cold atoms in optical lattices, and quantum circuits.

<blockquote>
<p>
More than eighty years ago, H. Bethe pointed out the existence of bound states of elementary spin waves in one-dimensional quantum magnets. To date, identifying signatures of such magnon bound states has remained a subject of intense theoretical research while their detection has proved challenging for experiments. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting to reveal such bound states by tracking the spin dynamics after a local quantum quench with single-spin and single-site resolution. Here we report on the direct observation of two-magnon bound states using in-situ correlation measurements in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain realized with ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum walk of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of the two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single magnon excitations. In our measurements, we also determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is most likely limited by scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results open a new pathway for studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally, properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems.
