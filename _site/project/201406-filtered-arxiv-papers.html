    <p><strong>1.    A Measure of Non-Markovianity for Unital Quantum Dynamical Maps</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most important topics in the study of the dynamics of open quantum system is information exchange between system and environment. Based on the features of a back-flow information from an environment to a system, an approach is provided to detect non-Markovianity for unital dynamical maps. The method takes advantage of non-contractive property of the von Neumann entropy under completely positive and trace preserving unital maps. Accordingly, for the dynamics of a single qubit as an open quantum system, the sign of the time-derivative of the density matrix eigenvalues of the system determines the non-Markovianity of unital quantum dynamical maps. The main characteristics of the measure is to make the corresponding calculations and optimization procedure simpler.

In this paper, we consider continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on finite graphs determined by the Laplacian matrices. By introducing fully interconnected graph decomposition of given graphs, we show a decomposition method for the Laplacian matrices. Using the decomposition method, we show several conditions for graph structure which return probability of CTQW tends to 1 while the number of vertices tends to infinity.

<p><strong>3.    Nonclassical properties of a contradirectional nonlinear optical coupler</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the nonclassical properties of output fields propagated through a contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler consisting of a linear waveguide and a nonlinear (quadratic) waveguide operated by second harmonic generation. In contrast to the earlier results, all the initial fields are considered weak and a completely quantum mechanical model is used here to describe the system. Perturbative solutions of Heisenberg&#39;s equations of motion for various field modes are obtained using Sen-Mandal technique. Obtained solutions are subsequently used to show the existence of single-mode and intermodal squeezing, single-mode and intermodal antibunching, two-mode and multi-mode entanglement in the output of contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler. Further, existence of higher order nonclassicality is also established by showing the existence of higher order antibunching, higher order squeezing and higher order entanglement. Variation of observed nonclassical characters with different coupling constants and phase mismatch is discussed.

New J. Phys. 17 023063 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0468">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0468</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a new analytical method for studying the open quantum systems problem of a discrete system weakly coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators. Our approach is based on a phase space representation of the density matrix for a system coupled to a two-tiered environment. The dynamics of the system and its immediate environment are resolved in a non-Markovian way, and the environmental modes of the inner environment can themselves be damped by a wider `universe&#39;. Applying our approach to the canonical cases of the Rabi and spin-boson models we obtain new analytical expressions for an effective thermalisation temperature and corrections to the environmental response functions as direct consequences of considering such a tiered environment. A comparison with exact numerical simulations confirms that our approximate expressions are remarkably accurate, while their analytic nature offers the prospect of deeper understanding of the physics which they describe. A unique advantage of our method is that it permits the simultaneous inclusion of a continuous bath as well as discrete environmental modes, leading to wide and versatile applicability.

<p><strong>5.    Post-processing of the oblivious key in quantum private queries</strong><br>
Fei Gao, Bin Liu, Wei Huang, Qiao-Yan Wen<br>
Ieee Journal Of Selected Topics In Quantum Electronics, VOL. 21, NO. 3, 6600111, 2015<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0589">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0589</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum private query (QPQ) is a kind of quantum protocols to protect both users&#39; privacy in their communication. There is an interesting example, that is, Alice wants to buy one item from Bob&#39;s database, which is composed of a quantity of valuable messages. QPQ protocol is the communication procedure ensuring that Alice can get only one item from Bob, and at the same time, Bob cannot know which one was taken by Alice. Owing to its practicability, quantum-key-distribution-based QPQ has draw much attention in recent years. However, the post-processing of the key in such protocols, called oblivious key, remains far from being satisfactorily known. Especially, the error correction method for such special key is still missing. Here we focus on the post-processing of the oblivious key, including both dilution and error correction. On the one hand, we demonstrate that the previous dilution method, which greatly reduces the communication complexity, will bring Alice the chance to illegally obtain much additional information about Bob&#39;s database. Simulations show that by very limited queries Alice can obtain the whole database. On the other hand, we present an effective error-correction method for the oblivious key, which completes its post-processing and makes such QPQ more practical.

<p><strong>6.    Optimal Estimation of a Classical Force with a Damped Oscillator in the non-Markovian Bath</strong><br>
Yang Gao, Hwang Lee, Yong Lei Jia<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We solve the optimal quantum limit of probing a classical force exactly by a damped oscillator initially prepared in the factorized squeezed state. The memory effects of the thermal bath on the oscillator evolution are investigated. We show that the optimal force sensitivity obtained by the quantum estimation theory approaches to zero for the non-Markovian bath, whereas approaches to a finite non-zero value for the Markovian bath as the energy of the damped oscillator goes to infinity.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nanophotonic structures are routinely used to enhance light matter interactions by modifying the density of virtual photon states. This is often simplified to a scalar quantity, the local density of states (LDOS). However we show that the virtual photons also contain phase information. We show that the phase information of an emitter interacting with a modified density of virtual photon states has a non-trivial, non-intuitive behaviour. This extra phase information is vital in practical design of integrated quantum photonic circuits. We consider a quantum dot (QD) electron spin transition in a photonic crystal waveguide (PhCWG). The mode of a PhCWG is complex with local polarization variation across the crystal lattice. By placing the QD at a polarization singularity in the photonic mode, we show unidirectional emission, with a one-to-one correlation of spin orientation to path. We show a range of new functionalities suited to integrated photonic circuits, including spin-photon interfaces and photonic cluster state generation.

<p><strong>8.    Directional nanophotonic atom--waveguide interface based on spin--orbit interaction of light</strong><br>
R. Mitsch, C. Sayrin, B. Albrecht, P. Schneeweiss, A. Rauschenbeutel<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0896">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0896</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Optical waveguides in the form of glass fibers are the backbone of global telecommunication networks. In such optical fibers, the light is guided over long distances by continuous total internal reflection which occurs at the interface between the fiber core with a higher refractive index and the lower index cladding. Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the waveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this field is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical fibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to efficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g., tapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by the latter can lead to significant coupling of the light&#39;s spin and orbital angular momentum. Taking advantage of this effect, we demonstrate the controlled directional spontaneous emission of light by quantum emitters into a sub-wavelength-diameter waveguide. The effect is investigated in a paradigmatic setting, comprising cesium atoms which are located in the vicinity of a vacuum-clad silica nanofiber. We experimentally observe an asymmetry higher than 10:1 in the emission rates into the counterpropagating fundamental guided modes of the nanofiber. Moreover, we demonstrate that this asymmetry can be tailored by state preparation and suitable excitation of the quantum emitters. We expect our results to have important implications for research in nanophotonics and quantum optics and for implementations of integrated optical signal processing in the classical as well as in the quantum regime.

<p><strong>9.    Scale invariance and efficient classical simulation of the quantum Fourier transform</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0931">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0931</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide numerical evidence that the quantum Fourier transform can be efficiently represented in a matrix product operator with a size growing relatively slowly with the number of qubits. Additionally, we numerically show that the tensors in the operator converge to a common tensor as the number of qubits in the transform increases. Together these results imply that the application of the quantum Fourier transform to a matrix product state with $n$ qubits of maximum Schmidt rank $\chi$ can be simulated in $O(n (log(n))^2 \chi^2)$ time. We perform such simulations and quantify the error involved in representing the transform as a matrix product operator and simulating the quantum Fourier transform of periodic states.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum cellular automata have been recently considered as a fundamental approach to quantum field theory, resorting to a precise automaton, linear in the field, for the Dirac equation in one dimension. In such linear case a quantum automaton is isomorphic to a quantum walk, and a convenient formulation can be given in terms of transition matrices, leading to a new kind of discrete path integral that we solve analytically in terms of Jacobi polynomials versus the arbitrary mass parameter.

<blockquote>
<p>
Scalability from single qubit operations to multi-qubit circuits for quantum information processing requires architecture-specific implementations. Semiconductor hybrid qubit architecture is a suitable candidate to realize large scale quantum information processing, as it combines a universal set of logic gates with fast and all-electrical manipulation of qubits. We propose an implementation of hybrid qubits, based on Si Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots, compatible with the CMOS industrial technologic standards. We discuss the realization of multi-qubit circuits capable of fault-tolerant computation and quantum error correction, by evaluating the time and space resources needed for their implementation. As a result, the maximum density of quantum information is extracted from a circuit including 8 logical qubits encoded by the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. The corresponding surface density of logical qubits is 2.6 Mqubit/cm$^2$.

We develop a systematic and efficient approach for numerically solving the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equations for open quantum systems coupled to an environment up to arbitrary orders of noises or coupling strengths. As an important application, we consider a real-time simulation of a spin-boson model in a strong coupling regime that is difficult to deal with using conventional methods. We show that the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation can be efficiently implemented as a real--time simulation for this model, so as to give an accurate description of spin-boson dynamics beyond the rotating-wave approximation.

<blockquote>
<p>
Controlling the flow of light by means of nanophotonic waveguides has the potential of transforming integrated information processing much in the same way that conventional glass fibers have revolutionized global communication. Owing to the strong transverse confinement of the light, such waveguides give rise to a coupling between the internal spin of the guided photons and their orbital angular momentum. Here, we employ this spin-orbit coupling of light to break the mirror symmetry of the scattering of light by a single gold nanoparticle on the surface of a nanophotonic waveguide. We thereby realize a chiral waveguide coupler in which the handedness of the incident light determines the direction of propagation in the waveguide. Using this effect, we control the directionality of the scattering process and direct up to 94% of the incoupled light into a given direction. This enables novel ways for controlling and manipulating light in optical waveguides and nanophotonic structures as well as for the design of integrated optical sensors.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2338">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2338</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a new framework for constructing topological quantum memories, by recasting error recovery as a dynamical process on a cellular automaton. We envisage quantum systems controlled by a classical hardware composed of small local memories, communicating with neighbors, and repeatedly performing identical simple update rules. This approach does not require any global operations or complex decoding algorithms. Our cellular automata draw inspiration from classical field theories, with a Coulomb-like potential naturally emerging from the local dynamics. For a 3D automaton coupled to a 2D toric code, we present evidence of an error correction threshold above 6.1% for uncorrelated noise. A 2D automaton equipped with a more complex update rule yields a threshold above 8.2%. Our framework provides decisive new tools in the quest for realizing a passive dissipative quantum memory.

<p><strong>15.    A leakage-resilient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing with superconducting elements</strong><br>
Joydip Ghosh, Austin G. Fowler<br>
Phys. Rev. A 91, 020302(R) (2015)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2404">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2404</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Superconducting qubits, while promising for scalability and long coherence times, contain more than two energy levels, and therefore are susceptible to errors generated by the leakage of population outside of the computational subspace. Such leakage errors constitute a prominent roadblock towards fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) with superconducting qubits. FTQC using topological codes is based on sequential measurements of multiqubit stabilizer operators. Here, we first propose a leakage-resilient procedure to perform repetitive measurements of multiqubit stabilizer operators, and then use this scheme as an ingredient to develop a leakage-resilient approach for surface code quantum error correction with superconducting circuits. Our protocol is based on swap operations between data and ancilla qubits at the end of every cycle, requiring read-out and reset operations on every physical qubit in the system, and thereby preventing persistent leakage errors from occurring.

<blockquote>
<p>
Topological quantum computing promises error-resistant quantum computation without active error correction. However, there is a worry that during the process of executing quantum gates by braiding anyons around each other, extra anyonic excitations will be created that will disorder the encoded quantum information. Here we explore this question in detail by studying adiabatic code deformations on Hamiltonians based on topological codes, notably Kitaev&#39;s surface codes and the more recently discovered color codes. We develop protocols that enable universal quantum computing by adiabatic evolution in a way that keeps the energy gap of the system constant with respect to the computation size and introduces only simple local Hamiltonian interactions. This allows one to perform holonomic quantum computing with these topological quantum computing systems. The tools we develop allow one to go beyond numerical simulations and understand these processes analytically.

We apply quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) to an exactly solvable non-Markovian open quantum bit (qubit) system to achieve state-independent quantum control and construct high-fidelity quantum gates for moderate qubit decaying parameters. An important quantity, improvement $\mathcal{I}$, is proposed and defined to quantify the correction of gate errors due to the QOCT iteration when the environment effects are taken into account. With the help of the exact dynamics, we explore how the gate error is corrected in the open qubit system and determine the conditions for significant improvement. The model adopted in this paper can be implemented experimentally in realistic systems such as the circuit QED system.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose and analyze the design of a programmable photonic integrated circuit for high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation. We demonstrate that the reconfigurability of our design allows us to overcome two major impediments to quantum optics on a chip: it removes the need for a full fabrication cycle for each experiment and allows for compensation of fabrication errors using numerical optimization techniques. Under a pessimistic fabrication model for the silicon-on-insulator process, we demonstrate a dramatic fidelity improvement for the linear optics CNOT and CPHASE gates and, showing the scalability of this approach, the iterative phase estimation algorithm built from individually optimized gates. We also propose and simulate a novel experiment that the programmability of our system would enable: a statistically robust study of the evolution of entangled photons in disordered quantum walks. Overall, our results suggest that existing fabrication processes are sufficient to build a quantum photonic processor capable of high fidelity operation.

Nonlinear optical processes are governed by the relative-phase relationships among the relevant electromagnetic fields in these processes.

Furthermore, we show that such optical-frequency conversions can be realized by using a surprisingly simple technology where transparent plates are placed in a nonlinear optical medium and their positions and thicknesses are adjusted precisely. In a numerical experiment assuming practically applicable parameters in detail, we demonstrate a single-frequency tunable laser that covers the whole vacuum-ultraviolet spectral range of 120 to 200 nm.

Quantum Communications on planetary scale require complementary channels including ground and satellite links. The former have progressed up to commercial stage using fiber-cables, while for satellite links, the absence of terminals in orbit has impaired theirs development. However, the demonstration of the feasibility of such links is crucial for designing space payloads and to eventually enable the realization of protocols such as quantum-key-distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation along satellite-to-ground or intersatellite links. We demonstrated the faithful transmission of qubits from space to ground by exploiting satellite corner cube retroreflectors acting as transmitter in orbit, obtaining a low error rate suitable for QKD. We also propose a two-way QKD protocol exploiting modulated retroreflectors that necessitates a minimal payload on satellite, thus facilitating the expansion of Space Quantum Communications.

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to engineer photon emission and photon scattering is at the heart of modern photonics applications ranging from light harvesting, through novel compact light sources, to quantum-information processing based on single photons. Nanophotonic waveguides are particularly well suited for such applications since they confine photon propagation to a 1D geometry thereby increasing the interaction between light and matter. Adding chiral functionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling integrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel topological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates photons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are reverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a non-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and scattering may become directional. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the internal state of a quantum emitter determines the chirality of single-photon emission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. Single-photon emission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\% is observed under conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the waveguide. Such deterministic and highly directional photon emission enables on-chip optical diodes, circulators operating at the single-photon level, and deterministic quantum gates. Based on our experimental demonstration, we propose an experimentally achievable and fully scalable deterministic photon-photon CNOT gate, which so far has been missing in photonic quantum-information processing where most gates are probabilistic.

In quantum key distribution implementations, each session is typically chosen long enough so that the secret key rate approaches its asymptotic limit. However, this choice may be constrained by the physical scenario, as in the perspective use with satellites, where the passage of one terminal over the other is restricted to a few minutes. Here we demonstrate experimentally the extraction of secure keys leveraging an optimal design of the prepare-and-measure scheme, according to recent finite-key theoretical tight-bounds. The experiment is performed in different channel conditions, and assuming two distinct attack models: individual attacks, or general quantum attacks. The request on the number of exchanged qubits is then obtained as a function of the key size and of the ambient quantum bit error rate. The results indicate that viable conditions for effective symmetric, and even one-time-pad, cryptography are achievable.

Quipper is a recently released quantum programming language. In this report, we explore Quipper&#39;s programming framework by implementing the Deutsch&#39;s, Deutsch-Jozsa&#39;s, Simon&#39;s, Grover&#39;s, and Shor&#39;s factoring algorithms. It will help new quantum programmers in an instructive manner. We choose Quipper especially for its usability and scalability though it&#39;s an ongoing development project. We have also provided introductory concepts of Quipper and prerequisite backgrounds of the algorithms for readers&#39; convenience. We also have written codes for oracles (black boxes or functions) for individual algorithms and tested some of them using the Quipper simulator to prove correctness and introduce the readers with the functionality. As Quipper 0.5 does not include more than \ensuremath{4 \times 4} matrix constructors for Unitary operators, we have also implemented \ensuremath{8 \times 8} and \ensuremath{16 \times 16} matrix constructors.

Certain continuous-time quantum walks can be viewed as scattering processes. These processes can perform quantum computations, but it is challenging to design graphs with desired scattering behavior.

<p>
Employing the quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians for the collective and internal subsystems with a linear coupling, we studied the role of fermionic statistics on the dynamics of the collective motion. The transport coefficients are discussed as well as the associated fluctuation-dissipation relation. Due to different nature of the particles, the path to equilibrium is slightly affected. However, in the weak coupling regime, the time-scale for approaching equilibrium is found to be globally unchanged. The Pauli-blocking effect can modify the usual picture in open quantum system. In some limits, contrary to boson, this effect can strongly hinder the influence of the bath by blocking the interacting channels.

<p>
We consider a circuit-QED setup that allows the induction and control of non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit. Non-Markovianity is enforced over the qubit by means of its direct coupling to a bosonic mode which is controllably coupled to other qubit-mode system. We show that this configuration can be achieved in a circuit-QED setup consisting of two initially independent superconducting circuits, each formed by one charge qubit and one transmission-line resonator, which are put in interaction by coupling the resonators to a current-biased Josephson junction. We solve this problem exactly and then proceed with a thorough investigation of the emergent non-Markovianity in the dynamics of the qubits. Our study might serve the context for a first experimental assessment of non-Markovianity in a multi-element solid-state device.

<blockquote>
<p>
An approach, called discretized environment method, is introduced to treat exactly non-Markovian effects in open quantum systems. In this approach, a complex environment described by a spectral function is mapped into a finite set of discretized states with an appropriate coupling to the system of interest. The finite set of system plus environment degrees of freedom are then explicitly followed in time leading to a quasi-exact description. The present approach is anticipated to be particularly accurate in the low temperature and strongly non-Markovian regime. The discretized environment method is validated on a two-level system (qubit) coupled to a bosonic or fermionic heat bath. A perfect agreement with the quantum Langevin approach is found. Further illustrations are made on a three-level system (qutrit) coupled to a bosonic heat-bath. Emerging processes due to strong memory effects are discussed.

<p>
Solid-state quantum sensors are attracting wide interest because of their exceptional sensitivity at room temperature. In particular, the spin properties of individual nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond make it an outstanding nanoscale sensor of magnetic fields, electric fields, and temperature, under ambient conditions. Recent work on ensemble NV-based magnetometers, inertial sensors, and clocks have employed $N$ unentangled color centers to realize a factor of up to $\sqrt{N}$ improvement in sensitivity. However, to realize fully this signal enhancement, new techniques are required to excite efficiently and to collect fluorescence from large NV ensembles. Here, we introduce a light-trapping diamond waveguide (LTDW) geometry that enables both high fluorescence collection ($\sim20\%$) and efficient pump absorption achieving an effective path length exceeding $1$ meter in a millimeter-sized device. The LTDW enables in excess of $2\%$ conversion efficiency of pump photons into optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) fluorescence, a \textit{three orders of magnitude} improvement over previous single-pass geometries. This dramatic enhancement of ODMR signal enables broadband measurements of magnetic field and temperature at less than $1$ Hz, a frequency range inaccessible by dynamical decoupling techniques. We demonstrate $\sim 1~\mbox{nT}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity for $0.1$ Hz to $10$ Hz and a thermal sensitivity of $\sim 400 ~\mu\mbox{K}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ and estimate a spin projection limit at $\sim 0.36$ fT/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ and $\sim 139~\mbox{pK}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, respectively.

<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the connection between two recently introduced notions of non-Markovian quantum dynamics and the validity of the so-called quantum regression theorem. While non-Markovianity of a quantum dynamics has been defined looking at the behaviour in time of the statistical operator, which determines the evolution of mean values, the quantum regression theorem makes statements about the behaviour of system correlation functions of order two and higher. The comparison relies on an estimate of the validity of the quantum regression hypothesis, which can be obtained exactly evaluating two points correlation functions. To this aim we consider a qubit undergoing dephasing due to interaction with a bosonic bath, comparing the exact evaluation of the non-Markovianity measures with the violation of the quantum regression theorem for a class of spectral densities. We further study a photonic dephasing model, recently exploited for the experimental measurement of non-Markovianity. It appears that while a non-Markovian dynamics according to either definition brings with itself violation of the regression hypothesis, even Markovian dynamics can lead to a failure of the regression relation.

<p>
We develop the theory to describe the equilibrium ion positions and phonon modes for a trapped ion quantum simulator in an oblate Paul trap that creates two-dimensional Coulomb crystals in a triangular lattice. By coupling the internal states of the ions to laser beams propagating along the symmetry axis, we study the effective Ising spin-spin interactions that are mediated via the axial phonons and are less sensitive to ion micromotion. We find that the axial mode frequencies permit the programming of Ising interactions with inverse power law spin-spin couplings that can be tuned from uniform to $r^{-3}$ with DC voltages. Such a trap could allow for interesting new geometrical configurations for quantum simulations on moderately sized systems including frustrated magnetism on triangular lattices or Aharonov-Bohm effects on ion tunneling. The trap also incorporates periodic boundary conditions around loops which could be employed to examine time crystals.

<p>
In the study of open quantum systems, information exchange between system and its surrounding environment plays an eminent and important role in analysing the dynamics of open quantum system. In this work, by making use of the quantum information theory and intrinsic properties such as \emph{entropy exchange}, \emph{coherent information} and using the notion of \emph{quantum loss} as a criterion of the amount of lost information, we will propose a new witness, based on information exchange, to detect non-Markovianity. Also a measure for determining the degree of non-Markovianity, will be introduced by using our witness. The characteristic of non-Markovianity is clarified by means of our witness, and we emphasize that this measure is constructed based on the loss of information or in other word the rate of \emph{quantum loss} in the environment. It is defined in term of reducing correlation between system and ancillary. Actually, our focus is on the information which be existed in the environment and it has been entered to the environment due to its interaction with the system. Remarkably, due to choosing the situation which the &quot;system +ancillary&quot; in maximal entangled pure state, optimization procedure does not need in calculation of our measure, such that the degree of non-Markovianity is computed analytically by straightforward calculations.

The scattering of a flying photon by a two-level system ultrastrongly coupled to a one-dimensional photonic waveguide is studied numerically. The photonic medium is modeled as an array of coupled cavities and the whole system is analyzed beyond the rotating wave approximation using Matrix Product States. It is found that the scattering is strongly influenced by the single- and multi-photon dressed bound states present in the system. In the ultrastrong coupling regime a new channel for inelastic scattering appears, where an incident photon deposits energy into the qubit, exciting a photon-bound state, and escaping with a lower frequency. This single-photon nonlinear frequency conversion process can reach up to 50\% efficiency. Other remarkable features in the scattering induced by counter-rotating terms are a blueshift of the reflection resonance and a Fano resonance due to long-lived excited states

Hidden Markov Models are widely used in classical computer science to model stochastic processes with a wide range of applications. This paper concerns the quantum analogues of these machines --- so-called Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs). Using the properties of Quantum Physics, HQMMs are able to generate more complex random output sequences than their classical counterparts, even when using the same number of internal states. They are therefore expected to find applications as quantum simulators of stochastic processes. Here, we emphasise that open quantum systems with instantaneous feedback are examples of HQMMs, thereby identifying a novel application of quantum feedback control.

<blockquote>
<p>
Current approaches for building quantum computing devices focus on two-level quantum systems which nicely mimic the concept of a classical bit, albeit enhanced with additional quantum properties. However, rather than artificially limiting the number of states to two, the use of d-level quantum systems (qudits) could provide advantages for quantum information processing. Among other merits, it has recently been shown that multi-level quantum systems can offer increased stability to external disturbances - a key problem in current technologies. In this study we demonstrate that topological quantum memories built from qudits, also known as abelian quantum double models, exhibit a substantially increased resilience to noise. That is, even when taking into account the multitude of errors possible for multi-level quantum systems, topological quantum error correction codes employing qudits can sustain a larger error rate than their two-level counterparts. In particular, we find strong numerical evidence that the thresholds of these error-correction codes are given by the hashing bound. Considering the significantly increased error thresholds attained, this might well outweigh the added complexity of engineering and controlling higher dimensional quantum systems.

In the second part we investigate how successful the algorithm can be if the number of elements of the database is not known precisely. This question reduces to analysis of the distinguishability of states occurring during Grover&#39;s algorithm. We found that using unambiguous discrimination scheme even a seemingly good guess, that is close to the optimal one can result in a rather small success rate.

Self-testing refers to the fact that, in some quantum devices, both states and measurements can be assessed in a black-box scenario, on the sole basis of the observed statistics, i.e. without reference to any prior device calibration. Only a few examples of self-testing are known, and they just provide non-trivial assessment for devices performing unrealistically close to the ideal case. We overcome these difficulties by approaching self-testing with the semi-definite programming hierarchy for the characterization of quantum correlations. This allows us to improve dramatically the robustness of previous self-testing schemes -e.g.: we show that a CHSH violation larger than 2.57 certifies a singlet fidelity of more than 70%. In addition, the versatility of the tool brings about self-testing of hitherto impossible cases, such as robust self-testing of non-maximally entangled two-qutrit states in the CGLMP scenario.

We study quantum dynamics of Grover&#39;s adiabatic search algorithm with the equivalent two-level system. Its adiabatic and non-adiabatic evolutions are visualized as trajectories of Bloch vectors on a Bloch sphere.

The size dependence of the critical running time is expressed in terms of Lambert $W$ function. The transitionless driving Hamiltonian is obtained to make a quantum state follow the adiabatic path. We demonstrate that a constant Hamiltonian, approximate to the exact time-dependent driving Hamiltonian, can alter the non-adiabatic transition probability from the inverse square decay to the inverse fourth power decay with running time. This may open up a new way of reducing errors in adiabatic quantum computation.

The perturbative treatment leads to the time-convolutionless (TCL) and the Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) master equations. So to this end, we derive the time-convolutionless (TCL) and the Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) master equations for the system and compare the dynamics given by the three master equations. We find the validity condition for the TCL and NZ master equations. Based on the exact non-Markovian master equation, we analyze the regime of validity for the secular approximation in the time-convolutionless master equation and discuss the leading corrections of the nonsecular terms to the quantum dynamics, significant effects are found in the dynamics of the driven system.

<blockquote>
<p>
Controlling photon emission by single quantum emitters with nanostructures is crucial for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. Nowadays nanoresonators can affect the lifetime of emitters and ultimately induce strong coupling between the emitters and the light field, while nanoantennas can control the directionality of the emission. Expanding this control to the manipulation of the emission of orbital angular momentum-changing transitions would enable coupling between long-lived solid-state qubits and flying qubits. As these transitions are associated with circular rather than linear dipoles, such control requires detailed knowledge of the spatially dependent interaction of a complex dipole with highly structured optical eigenstates containing local helicity. Using a classical analogue, we experimentally map the coupling of circular dipoles to photonic modes in a model structure, a photonic crystal waveguide. We show that depending on the local helicity the dipoles can be made to couple to modes either propagating to the left or to the right. The maps are in excellent agreement with calculations. Our measurements, therefore, demonstrate the coupling of spin to photonic pathway with near-unity (0.8 $\pm$ 0.1) efficiency.

Boson sampling is a simple model for non-universal linear optics quantum computing using far fewer physical resources than universal schemes.

We show that an analogous procedure implements the same problem, using photon-added or -subtracted squeezed vacuum states (with arbitrary squeezing), where sampling at the output is performed via parity measurements. The equivalence is exact and independent of the squeezing parameter, and hence provides an entire class of new quantum states of light in the same complexity class as boson sampling.

<blockquote>
<p>
The interaction between light and matter can give rise to novel topological states. This principle was recently exemplified in Floquet topological insulators, where \emph{classical} light was used to induce a topological electronic band structure. Here, in contrast, we show that mixing \emph{single} photons with excitons can result in new topological polaritonic states --- or &quot;topolaritons&quot;. Taken separately, the underlying photons and excitons are topologically trivial. Combined appropriately, however, they give rise to non-trivial polaritonic bands with chiral edge modes allowing for unidirectional polariton propagation. The main ingredient in our construction is an exciton-photon coupling with a phase that winds in momentum space. We demonstrate how this winding emerges from spin-orbit coupling in the electronic system and an applied Zeeman field. We discuss the requirements for obtaining a sizable topological gap in the polariton spectrum, and propose practical ways to realize topolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

<p><strong>51.    Second-order quantum nonlinear optical processes in single graphene nanostructures and arrays</strong><br>
Marco T. Manzoni, Iván Silveiro, F. Javier García de Abajo, Darrick E. Chang<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Intense efforts have been made in recent years to realize nonlinear optical interactions at the single-photon level. Much of this work has focused on achieving strong third-order nonlinearities, such as by using single atoms or other quantum emitters while the possibility of achieving strong second-order nonlinearities remains unexplored. Here, we describe a novel technique to realize such nonlinearities using graphene, exploiting the strong per-photon fields associated with tightly confined graphene plasmons in combination with spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. We show that in properly designed graphene nanostructures, these conditions enable extremely strong internal down-conversion between a single quantized plasmon and an entangled plasmon pair, or the reverse process of second harmonic generation. A separate issue is how such strong internal nonlinearities can be observed, given the nominally weak coupling between these plasmon resonances and free-space radiative fields. On one hand, by using the collective coupling to radiation of nanostructure arrays, we show that the internal nonlinearities can manifest themselves as efficient frequency conversion of radiative fields at extremely low input powers. On the other hand, the development of techniques to efficiently couple to single nanostructures would allow these nonlinear processes to occur at the level of single input photons.

<p><strong>52.    On the generalization of linear least mean squares estimation to quantum systems with non-commutative outputs</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4599">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4599</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The purpose of this paper is to study the problem of generalizing the Belavkin-Kalman filter to the case where the classical measurement signal is replaced by a fully quantum non-commutative output signal. We formulate a least mean squares estimation problem that involves a non-commutative system as the filter processing the non-commutative output signal. We solve this estimation problem within the framework of non-commutative probability. Also, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions which make these non-commutative estimators physically realizable.

<blockquote>
<p>
A brief perspective on light scattering in dense and cold atomic rubidium is presented. We particularly focus on the influence of auxiliary applied fields on the system response to a weak and nearly resonant probe field. Auxiliary fields can strongly disturb light propagation; in addition to the steady state case, dynamically interesting effects appear clearly in both the time domain, and in the optical polarization dependence of the processes. Following a general introduction, two examples of features found in such studies are presented. These include nonlinear optical effects in (a) comparative studies of forward- and fluorescence-configuration scattering under combined excitation of a control and probe field, and (b) manipulation of the spatial structure of the optical response due to a light shifting strong applied field.

<p><strong>54.    Stochastic Variational Method as a Quantization Scheme II: Quantization of Electromagnetic Fields</strong><br>
T. Koide. T. Kodama, K. Tsushima<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6295">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6295</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantization of electromagnetic fields is investigated in the framework of stochastic variational method (SVM). Differently from the canonical quantization, this method does not require canonical form and quantization can be performed directly from the gauge invariant Lagrangian. The gauge condition is used to choose dynamically independent variables. We verify that, in the Coulomb gauge condition, SVM result is completely equivalent to the traditional result. On the other hand, in the Lorentz gauge condition, SVM quantization can be performed without introducing the indefinite metric. The temporal and longitudinal components of the gauge filed, then, behave as c-number functionals affected by quantum fluctuation through the interaction with charged matter fields. To see further the relation between SVM and the canonical quantization, we quantize the usual gauge Lagrangian with the Fermi term and argue a stochastic process with a negative second order correlation is introduced to reproduce the indefinite metric.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report on the first direct observation of fast spin-exchange coherent oscillations between different long-lived electronic orbitals of ultracold $^{173}$Yb fermions. We measure, in a model-independent way, the strength of the exchange interaction driving this coherent process. This observation allows us to retrieve important information on the inter-orbital collisional properties of $^{173}$Yb atoms and paves the way to novel quantum simulations of paradigmatic models of two-orbital quantum magnetism.

<p><strong>56.    Quantum Optimization of Fully-Connected Spin Glasses</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7553">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7553</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with random $\pm1$ couplings is programmed on the D-Wave Two annealer featuring 509 qubits interacting on a Chimera-type graph. The performance of the optimizer compares and correlates to simulated annealing. When considering the effect of the static noise, which degrades the performance of the annealer, one can estimate an improvement on the comparative scaling of the two methods in favor of the D-Wave machine. The optimal choice of parameters of the embedding on the Chimera graph is shown to be associated to the emergence of the spin-glass critical temperature of the embedded problem.

<p><strong>57.    Curvature-induced bound states in Robin waveguides and their asymptotical properties</strong><br>
Pavel Exner, Alexander Minakov<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7624">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7624</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze bound states of Robin Laplacian in infinite planar domains with a smooth boundary, in particular, their relations to the geometry of the latter. The domains considered have locally straight boundary being, for instance, locally deformed halfplanes or wedges, or infinite strips, alternatively they are the exterior of a bounded obstacle. In the situation when the Robin condition is strongly attractive, we derive a two-term asymptotic formula in which the next-to-leading term is determined by the extremum of the boundary curvature. We also discuss the non-asymptotic case of attractive boundary interaction and show that the discrete spectrum is nonempty if the domain is a local deformation of a halfplane or a wedge of angle less than $\pi$, and it is void if the domain is concave.
