    <p><strong>1.    Deterministic linear optics quantum computation utilizing linked photon circuits</strong><br>
Nadav Yoran, Benni Reznik<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 037903 (2003).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303008">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303008</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest an efficient scheme for quantum computation with linear optical elements utilizing &quot;linked&quot; photon states. The linked states are designed according to the particular quantum circuit one wishes to process. Once a linked-state has been successfully prepared, the computation is pursued deterministically by a sequence of teleportation steps. The present scheme enables a significant reduction of the average number of elementary gates per logical gate to about 20-30 CZ_{9/16} gates.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum error rejection code with spontaneous parametric conversion</strong><br>
Xiang-bin Wang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303010">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303010</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a linear optics scheme with SPDC process to test the fault tolerance property of quantum error correction code. To transmit an unknown qubit robustly through the noisy channel, one may first encode it into a certain quantum error correction code and then transmit it. The remote party decodes it and stores it. Sending a qubit in such a way can significantly reduces the error rate compared with directly sending the qubit itself. Here we show how to realize such a scheme by linear optics.

<p><strong>3.    Robust long-distance entanglement and a loophole-free Bell test with ions and photons</strong><br>
Christoph Simon, William T.M. Irvine<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 110405 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303023">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303023</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Two trapped ions that are kilometers apart can be entangled by the joint detection of two photons, each coming from one of the ions, in a basis of entangled states. Such a detection is possible with linear optical elements. The use of two-photon interference allows entanglement distribution without interferometric sensitivity to the path length of the photons. The present method of creating entangled ions also opens up the possibility of a loophole-free test of Bell&#39;s inequalities.

<p><strong>4.    Quantum Search of Spatial Regions</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303041">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303041</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Can Grover&#39;s algorithm speed up search of a physical region - for example a 2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to be needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show that this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by Benioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time O(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More generally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs, motivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly the holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this model include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a generalized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties, not just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality&#39; for unitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an O(sqrt(n))-qubit communication protocol for the disjointness problem, which improves an upper bound of Hoyer and de Wolf and matches a lower bound of Razborov.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum random walks - an introductory overview</strong><br>

<p>
This article aims to provide an introductory survey on quantum random walks. Starting from a physical effect to illustrate the main ideas we will introduce quantum random walks, review some of their properties and outline their striking differences to classical walks. We will touch upon both physical effects and computer science applications, introducing some of the main concepts and language of present day quantum information science in this context. We will mention recent developments in this new area and outline some open questions.

<p><strong>6.    Multiparticle entanglement purification for graph states</strong><br>
W. Dür, H. Aschauer, H.-J. Briegel<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 107903 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303087">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303087</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a class of multiparticle entanglement purification protocols that allow us to distill a large class of entangled states. These include cluster states, GHZ states and various error correction codes all of which belong to the class of two-colorable graph states. We analyze these schemes under realistic conditions and observe that they are scalable, i.e. the threshold value for imperfect local operations does not depend on the number of parties for many of these states. When compared to schemes based on bipartite entanglement purification, the protocol is more efficient and the achievable quality of the purified states is larger. As an application we discuss an experimental realization of the protocol in optical lattices which allows one to purify cluster states.

<p><strong>7.    Experimental Controlled-NOT Logic Gate for Single Photons in the Coincidence Basis</strong><br>
T.B. Pittman, M.J. Fitch, B.C Jacobs, J.D. Franson<br>
Phys. Rev. A 68, 032316 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303095">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303095</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report a proof-of-principle demonstration of a probabilistic controlled-NOT gate for single photons. Single-photon control and target qubits were mixed with a single ancilla photon in a device constructed using only linear optical elements. The successful operation of the controlled-NOT gate relied on post-selected three-photon interference effects which required the detection of the photons in the output modes.

<p><strong>8.    Reversible simulation of bipartite product Hamiltonians</strong><br>
Andrew M. Childs, Debbie W. Leung, Guifre Vidal<br>
IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory Vol. 50, No. 6, 1189-1197 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303097">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303097</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider two quantum systems A and B interacting according to a product Hamiltonian H = H_A x H_B. We show that any two such Hamiltonians can be used to simulate each other reversibly (i.e., without efficiency losses) with the help of local unitary operations and local ancillas. Accordingly, all non-local features of a product Hamiltonian -- including the rate at which it can be used to produce entanglement, transmit classical or quantum information, or simulate other Hamiltonians -- depend only upon a single parameter. We identify this parameter and use it to obtain an explicit expression for the entanglement capacity of all product Hamiltonians. Finally, we show how the notion of simulation leads to a natural formulation of measures of the strength of a nonlocal Hamiltonian.

<p><strong>9.    Limitations on building single-photon-resolution detection devices</strong><br>
Pieter Kok<br>
IEEE: Sel. Top. Quantum Electronics 9, 1498 (2003).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303102">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303102</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Single-photon resolution (SPR) detectors can tell the difference between incoming wave packets of n and n+1 photons. Such devices are especially important for linear optical quantum computing with projective measurements. However, in this paper I show that it is impossible to construct a photodetector with single-photon resolution when we are restricted to single-photon sources, linear optical elements and projective measurements with standard (non-photon-number discriminating) photodetectors. These devices include SPR detectors that sometimes fail to distinguish one- and two-photon inputs, but at the same time indicate this failure.

<p><strong>10.    Three routes to the exact asymptotics for the one-dimensional quantum walk</strong><br>
Hilary A. Carteret, Mourad E. H. Ismail, Bruce Richmond<br>
J. Phys. A., vol. 36, no. 33, pp 8775-8795 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303105">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303105</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate an alternative method for calculating the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete one-coin quantum walk on the infinite line, via the Jacobi polynomials that arise in the path integral representation. This is significantly easier to use than the Darboux method. It also provides a single integral representation for the wavefunction that works over the full range of positions, $n,$ including throughout the transitional range where the behaviour changes from oscillatory to exponential. Previous analyses of this system have run into difficulties in the transitional range, because the approximations on which they were based break down here. The fact that there are two different kinds of approach to this problem (Path Integral vs. Schr\&quot;{o}dinger wave mechanics) is ultimately a manifestation of the equivalence between the path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the original formulation developed in the 1920s. We discuss how and why our approach is related to the two methods that have already been used to analyse these systems.

<p><strong>11.    Heralded Two-Photon Entanglement from Probabilistic Quantum Logic Operations on Multiple Parametric Down-Conversion Sources</strong><br>
T.B. Pittman, M.M. Donegan, M.J. Fitch, B.C. Jacobs, J.D. Franson, P. Kok, H. Lee, J.P. Dowling<br>
IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quant. Elec. 9, 1478 (2003)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303113">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303113</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An ideal controlled-NOT gate followed by projective measurements can be used to identify specific Bell states of its two input qubits. When the input qubits are each members of independent Bell states, these projective measurements can be used to swap the post-selected entanglement onto the remaining two qubits. Here we apply this strategy to produce heralded two-photon polarization entanglement using Bell states that originate from independent parametric down-conversion sources, and a particular probabilistic controlled-NOT gate that is constructed from linear optical elements. The resulting implementation is closely related to an earlier proposal by Sliwa and Banaszek [quant-ph/0207117], and can be intuitively understood in terms of familiar quantum information protocols. The possibility of producing a ``pseudo-demand&#39;&#39; source of two-photon entanglement by storing and releasing these heralded pairs from independent cyclical quantum memory devices is also discussed.

<p>
We implement experimentally a deterministic method to prepare and measure so called single-photon two-qubit entangled states or single-photon Bell-states, in which the polarization and the spatial modes of a single-photon each represent a quantum bit. All four single-photon Bell-states can be easily prepared and measured deterministically using linear optical elements alone. We also discuss how this method can be used for recently proposed single-photon two-qubit quantum cryptography protocol.

<p><strong>13.    Macroscopic Quantum Resonance of Coupled Flux Qubits; A Quantum Computation Scheme</strong><br>
Hide Akisato<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303128">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303128</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a superconducting circuit containing two loops, when treated with Macroscopic Quantum Coherence (MQC) theory, constitutes a complete two-bit quantum computer. The manipulation of the system is easily implemented with alternating magnetic fields. A \textit{universal} set of quantum gates is deemed available by means of all unitary single bit operations and a controlled-not (\textsc{cnot}) sequence. We use multi-dimensional MQC theory and time-dependent first order perturbation theory to analyze the model. Our calculations show that a two qubit arrangement, each having a diameter of 200nm, operating in the flux regime can be operated with a static magnetic field of $\sim 0.1$T, and an alternating dynamic magnetic field of amplitude $\sim 1$ Gauss and frequency $\sim 10$Hz. The operational time $\tau_{op}$ is estimated to be $\sim 10$ns.

<p><strong>14.    Dressed Qubits</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303129">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303129</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Inherent gate errors can arise in quantum computation when the actual system Hamiltonian or Hilbert space deviates from the desired one. Two important examples we address are spin-coupled quantum dots in the presence of spin-orbit perturbations to the Heisenberg exchange interaction, and off-resonant transitions of a qubit embedded in a multilevel Hilbert space. We propose a ``dressed qubit&#39;&#39; transformation for dealing with such inherent errors. Unlike quantum error correction, the dressed qubits method does not require additional operations or encoding redundancy, is insenstitive to error magnitude, and imposes no new experimental constraints.

<p><strong>15.    Generation of entangled ancilla states for use in linear optics quantum computing</strong><br>
J.D. Franson, M. M. Donegan, B.C. Jacobs<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303137">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303137</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe several different methods for generating the entangled ancilla states that are required for linear optics quantum computing. We show that post-selection can be used in combination with linear optical elements to generate the entangled ancilla, but with an exponentially-small efficiency. Alternatively, the ancilla can be efficiently generated using solid-state devices consisting of quantum wells coupled with tunnel junctions. Finally, we consider the possibility of using encoded ancilla in order to reduce the effects of decoherence and measurement errors.

<p><strong>16.    Entanglement cost of generalised measurements</strong><br>
Richard Jozsa, Masato Koashi, Noah Linden, Sandu Popescu, Stuart Presnell, Dan Shepherd, Andreas Winter<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303167">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303167</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bipartite entanglement is one of the fundamental quantifiable resources of quantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to the theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark&#39;s theorem any rank 1 generalised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann measurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla. By considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement directions and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of entanglement cost E_min(M) of M. We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a given POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost and explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We prove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any dimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of the cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs. The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions symmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an analytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of any d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly than any other POVM with d&gt;2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This strongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.

<p><strong>17.    Quantum coin tossing and bit-string generation in the presence of noise</strong><br>
Jonathan Barrett, Serge Massar<br>
Phys. Rev. A 69, 022322 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303182">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303182</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discuss the security implications of noise for quantum coin tossing protocols. We find that if quantum error correction can be used, so that noise levels can be made arbitrarily small, then reasonable security conditions for coin tossing can be framed so that results from the noiseless case will continue to hold. If, however, error correction is not available (as is the case with present day technology), and significant noise is present, then tossing a single coin becomes problematic. In this case, we are led to consider random n-bit string generation in the presence of noise, rather than single-shot coin tossing. We introduce precise security criteria for n-bit string generation and describe an explicit protocol that could be implemented with present day technology. In general, a cheater can exploit noise in order to bias coins to their advantage. We derive explicit upper bounds on the average bias achievable by a cheater for given noise levels.
