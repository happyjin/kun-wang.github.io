    <p><strong>1.    Deterministic photonic spatial-polarization hyper-controlled-not gate assisted by quantum dot inside one-side optical microcavity</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Up to now, all the works about constructing quantum logic gates, an essential part in quantum computing, are focused on operating on one degree of freedom (DOF) of quantum systems. Here, we investigate the possibility to achieve a scalable photonic quantum computing based on two DOFs of quantum systems and construct a deterministic hyper-controlled-not (hyper-CNOT) gate operating on both spatial-mode and polarization DOFs of a photon pair simultaneously, by using the giant optical Faraday rotation induced by a single-electron spin in a quantum dot inside a one-side optical microcavity as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics. With this hyper-CNOT gate and linear optical elements, two-photon four-qubit cluster entangled states can be prepared and analyzed, which gives an application to manipulate more information with less resources. We analyze the experimental feasibility of this hyper-CNOT gate and show that it can be implemented with current technology.

<p><strong>2.    Quantum error correction and detection: quantitative analysis of a coherent-state amplitude damping code</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We re-examine a non-Gaussian quantum error correction code designed to protect optical coherent-state qubits against errors due to an amplitude damping channel. We improve on a previous result [Phys. Rev. A 81, 062344 (2010)] by providing a tighter upper bound on the performance attained when considering realistic assumptions which constrain the operation of the gates employed in the scheme. The quantitative characterization is performed through measures of fidelity and concurrence, the latter obtained by employing the code as an entanglement distillation protocol. We find that, when running the code in fully-deterministic error correction mode, direct transmission can only be beaten for certain combinations of channel and input state parameters, whereas in error detection mode, the usage of higher repetition encodings remains beneficial throughout.

<p><strong>3.    Assessing quantum error correction: fidelity and entanglement measures with application to photonic codes</strong><br>
Ricardo Wickert, Peter van Loock<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0279">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0279</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
By interpreting the well-known, qualitative criteria for the existence of quantum error correction (QEC) codes by Knill and Laflamme from a quantitative perspective, we propose a figure of merit for assessing a QEC scheme based on the average fidelity between codewords. This enables us to quantify the performance of a protocol as a whole, including errors beyond the correctable set. Various examples are calculated for photonic qubit codes dealing with the experimentally relevant case of photon loss, demonstrating the advantages of the new measure. In the context of continuous-variable QEC, our codeword-overlap measure can be used to reproduce, in a different way with no need for calculating entanglement measures, a previous result concerning the impossibility of improving transmission of Gaussian states through Gaussian channels via Gaussian operations alone.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a simple protocol for adaptive quantum state tomography, which reduces the worst-case infidelity between the estimate and the true state from $O(N^{-1/2})$ to $O(N^{-1})$. It uses a single adaptation step and just one extra measurement setting. In a linear optical qubit experiment, we demonstrate a full order of magnitude reduction in infidelity (from $0.1%$ to $0.01%$) for a modest number of samples ($N=3\times10^4$).

<p><strong>5.    Performing private database queries in a real-world environment using a quantum protocol</strong><br>
Philip Chan, Itzel Lucio-Martinez, Xiaofan Mo, Christoph Simon, Wolfgang Tittel<br>
Scientific Reports 4, Article number: 5233 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0865">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0865</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the well-studied cryptographic primitive 1-out-of-N oblivious transfer, a user retrieves a single element from a database of size N without the database learning which element was retrieved. While it has previously been shown that a secure implementation of 1-out-of-N oblivious transfer is impossible against arbitrarily powerful adversaries, recent research has revealed an interesting class of private query protocols based on quantum mechanics in a cheat sensitive model. Specifically, a practical protocol does not need to guarantee that database cannot learn what element was retrieved if doing so carries the risk of detection. The latter is sufficient motivation to keep a database provider honest. However, none of the previously proposed protocols could cope with noisy channels. Here we present a fault-tolerant private query protocol, in which the novel error correction procedure is integral to the security of the protocol. Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of the protocol over a deployed fibre.

<p><strong>6.    Long-term effect of inter-mode transitions in quantum Markovian process</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the Markovian process of a multi-mode open system connecting with a non-equilibrium environment, which consists of several heat baths with different temperatures. As an illustration, we study the steady state of three linearly coupled harmonic oscillators in long time evolution, two of which contact with two independent bosonic heat baths with different temperatures respectively. We show that the inter-mode transitions mediated by the environment is responsible for the long time behaviour of the dynamics evolution, which is usually considered to take effect only in short time dynamics of the system immersed in a equilibrium heat bath with a single temperature. In non-equilibrium systems, the ignorance of the inter-mode transitions may give rise to some counter-intuitive result, thus they cannot be neglected.

<p><strong>7.    Fractional Bloch oscillations in photonic lattices</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Bloch oscillations, the oscillatory motion of a quantum particle in a periodic potential, are one of the most fascinating effects of coherent quantum transport. Originally studied in the context of electrons in crystals, Bloch oscillations manifest the wave nature of matter and are found in a wide variety of different physical systems. Here we report on the first experimental observation of fractional Bloch oscillations, using a photonic lattice as a model system of a two-particle extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In our photonic simulator, the dynamics of two correlated particles hopping on a one-dimensional lattice is mapped into the motion of a single particle in a two-dimensional lattice with engineered defects and mimicked by light transport in a square waveguide lattice with a bent axis.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a variation of the discrete time quantum walk, the nonreversal quantum walk, which does not step back onto a position which it has just occupied. This allows us to simulate a dimer and we achieve it by introducing a new type of coin operator. The nonrepeating walk, which never moves in the same direction in consecutive time steps, arises by a permutation of this coin operator. We describe the basic properties of both walks and prove that the even-order joint moments of the nonrepeating walker are independent of the initial condition, being determined by five parameters derived from the coin instead. Numerical evidence suggests that the same is the case for the nonreversal walk. This contrasts strongly with previously studied coins, such as the Grover operator, where the initial condition can be used to control the standard deviation of the walker.

<p><strong>9.    Controlling single-photon transport in waveguides with finite cross-section</strong><br>
Jin-Feng Huang, Tao Shi, C. P. Sun, Franco Nori<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1981">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1981</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the transverse-size effect of a quasi-one-dimensional rectangular waveguide on the single-photon scattering on a two-level system. We calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients for single incident photons using the scattering formalism based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. When the transverse size of the waveguide is larger than a critical size, we find that the transverse mode will be involved in the single-photon scattering. Including the coupling to a higher traverse mode, we find that the photon in the lowest channel will be lost into the other channel, corresponding to the other transverse modes, when the input energy is larger than the maximum bound-state energy. Three kinds of resonance phenomena are predicted: single-photon resonance, photonic Feshbach resonance, and cutoff (minimum) frequency resonance. At these resonances, the input photon is completely reflected.

<blockquote>
<p>
Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation from the results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation of fault-tolerant logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm re-synthesizes quantum circuits composed of Clifford group and T gates, the latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g., those based on the Steane or surface codes, with the purpose of minimizing both T-count and T-depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to re-synthesize circuits with additional ancillae to reduce T-depth at effectively no cost. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7% reduction in T-count and up to 87.6% reduction in T-depth without ancillae, or 99.7% reduction in T-depth using ancillae.

We demonstrate a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two independent, intrinsically pure, heralded single photons from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) at telecom wavelength. A visibility of $85.5\pm8.3%$ was achieved without using any bandpass filter. Thanks to the group-velocity-matched SPDC and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs), the 4-fold coincidence counts are one order higher than that in the previous experiments. The combination of bright single photon sources and SNSPDs is a crucial step for future practical quantum info-communication systems at telecom wavelength.

Lett. 90, 240401 (2003)], with no need of bandpass filters. This entanglement system is useful for quantum information protocols that require indistinguishable photons from independent sources.

<blockquote>
<p>
The system-environment interaction is simulated by light propagating in coupled photonic waveguides. The profile of the electromagnetic field provides intuitive physical insight to study the Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. The transition from non-Markovian to Markovian process is demonstrated by increasing the size of environment, as the energy evolution changes from oscillating to an exponential decay, and the revival period increases. Moreover, the dynamical decoupling with a sequence of phase modulations is introduced to such a photonic open system to form a band structure in time dimension, where the energy dissipation can be significantly accelerated or inhibited. It opens the possibility to tune the dissipation in photonic system, similar to the dynamic decoupling of spins.

<p><strong>14.    Psi-Epistemic Theories: The Role of Symmetry</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson, Adam Bouland, Lynn Chua, George Lowther<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2834">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2834</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Formalizing an old desire of Einstein, &quot;psi-epistemic theories&quot; try to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, while viewing quantum states as ordinary probability distributions over underlying objects called &quot;ontic states.&quot; Regardless of one&#39;s philosophical views about such theories, the question arises of whether one can cleanly rule them out, by proving no-go theorems analogous to the Bell Inequality. In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker (who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory for Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic psi-epistemic theory must be &quot;measurement contextual&quot; in dimensions 3 and higher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must &quot;behave badly under tensor product.&quot; In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker or PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d&gt;=3 that satisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations, and (2) &quot;maximum nontriviality&quot; (meaning that the probability distributions corresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem holds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of unitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure theory and differential geometry. On the other hand, we also show the surprising result that without the symmetry restriction, one can construct maximally-nontrivial psi-epistemic theories in every finite dimension d.

Cody Jones<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fourier states are multi-qubit registers that facilitate phase rotations in fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose distillation protocols for constructing the fundamental, $n$-qubit Fourier state with error $O(2^{-n})$ at a cost of $O(n \log n)$ Toffoli gates and Clifford gates, or any arbitrary Fourier state using $O(n^2)$ gates. We analyze these protocols with methods from digital signal processing. These results suggest that phase kickback, which uses Fourier states, could be the current lowest-overhead method for generating arbitrary phase rotations.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the single-photon propagation in the one-dimensional waveguide coupled to $N$ two-level atoms. For a waveguide coupled to $N$ distant atoms, the transparency can be induced by coherent interaction at resonance for an $even$ $number$ of $N$, while for an $odd$ $number$ of $N$, the photon can be fully reflected. We then can switch the photon transport by controlling the atomic number. For a waveguide coupled to a small atomic ensemble of $N$ atoms in the same position, the transparency disappears, and the photonic transport property displays a jump behavior near the resonance point.

Constructing a discrete model like a cellular automaton is a powerful method for understanding various dynamical systems. However, the relationship between the discrete model and its continuous analogue is, in general, nontrivial. As a quantum-mechanical cellular automaton, a discrete-time quantum walk is defined to include various quantum dynamical behavior. Here we generalize a discrete-time quantum walk on a line into the feed-forward quantum coin model, which depends on the coin state of the previous step. We show that our proposed model has an anomalous slow diffusion characterized by the porous-medium equation, while the conventional discrete-time quantum walk model shows ballistic transport.

<p>
Single photon sources based on semiconductor quantum dots offer distinct advantages for quantum information, including a scalable solid-state platform, ultrabrightness, and interconnectivity with matter qubits. A key prerequisite for their use in optical quantum computing and solid-state networks is a high level of efficiency and indistinguishability. Pulsed resonance fluorescence (RF) has been anticipated as the optimum condition for the deterministic generation of high-quality photons with vanishing effects of dephasing. Here, we generate pulsed RF single photons on demand from a single, microcavity-embedded quantum dot under s-shell excitation with 3-ps laser pulses. The pi-pulse excited RF photons have less than 0.3% background contributions and a vanishing two-photon emission probability. Non-postselective Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between two successively emitted photons is observed with a visibility of 0.97(2), comparable to trapped atoms and ions. Two single photons are further used to implement a high-fidelity quantum controlled-NOT gate.

Reliability is determined by calculating gate fidelities for the one-qubit logical gate. Specifically, we show that despite using a non-fault tolerant procedures in constructing a logical zero ancilla to implement the T-gate the gate fidelity of the logical gate, after perfect error correction, has no first order error terms. Meaning, any errors that may have occurred during implementation are `correctable&#39; and fault tolerance may still be achieved.

<blockquote>
<p>
Majorana fermions hold promise for quantum computation, because their non-Abelian braiding statistics allows for topologically protected operations on quantum information. Topological qubits can be constructed from pairs of well-separated Majoranas in networks of nanowires. The coupling to a superconducting charge qubit in a transmission line resonator (transmon) permits braiding of Majoranas by external variation of magnetic fluxes. We show that readout operations can also be fully flux-controlled, without requiring microscopic control over tunnel couplings. We identify the minimal circuit that can perform the initialization--braiding--measurement steps required to demonstrate non-Abelian statistics. We introduce the Random Access Majorana Memory, a scalable circuit that can perform a joint parity measurement on Majoranas belonging to a selection of topological qubits. Such multi-qubit measurements allow for the efficient creation of highly entangled states and simplify quantum error correction protocols by avoiding the need for ancilla qubits.

We introduce a scheme for generating entanglement between two quantum dots using a plasmonic waveguide made from an array of metal nanoparticles. We show that the scheme is robust to loss, enabling it to work over long distance plasmonic nanoparticle arrays, as well as in the presence of other imperfections such as the detuning of the energy levels of the quantum dots. The scheme represents an alternative strategy to the previously introduced dissipative driven schemes for generating entanglement in plasmonic systems. Here, the entanglement is generated by using dipole-induced interference effects and detection-based postselection. Thus, contrary to the widely held view that loss is major problem for quantum plasmonic systems, we provide a robust-to-loss entanglement generation scheme that could be used as a versatile building block for quantum state engineering and control at the nanoscale.

<p>
We study the behaviour of the glued trees algorithm described by Childs et al. in [STOC `03, Proc. 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (2004) 59] under decoherence. We consider a discrete time reformulation of the continuous time quantum walk protocol and apply a phase damping channel to the coin state, investigating the effect of such a mechanism on the probability of the walker appearing on the target vertex of the graph. We pay particular attention to any potential advantage coming from the use of weak decoherence for the spreading of the walk across the glued trees graph.

<blockquote>
<p>
Realizing optical-nonlinear effects at a single-photon level is a highly desirable but also extremely challenging task, because of both fundamental and practical difficulties. We present an avenue to surmounting these difficulties by exploiting quantum Zeno blockade in nonlinear optical systems. Considering specifically a lithium-niobate microresonator, we find that a deterministic phase gate can be realized between single photons with near-unity fidelity. Supported by established techniques for fabricating and operating such devices, our approach can provide an enabling tool for all-optical applications in both classical and quantum domains.

We theoretically and experimentally investigate the spectral tunability and purity of photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down conversion in periodically poled $\mathrm{KTiOPO_4}$ crystal with group-velocity matching condition. The numerical simulation predicts that the purity of joint spectral intensity ($P_{JSI}$) and the purity of joint spectral amplitude ($P_{JSA}$) can be kept higher than 0.98 and 0.81, respectively, when the wavelength is tuned from 1460 nm to 1675 nm, which covers the S-, C-, L-, and U-band in telecommunication wavelengths. We also directly measured the joint spectral intensity at 1565 nm, 1584 nm and 1565 nm, yielding $P_{JSI}$ of 0.989, 0.983 and 0.958, respectively. Such a photon source is useful for quantum information and communication systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a first-principles derivation of the Markovian semi-group master equation without invoking the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Instead we use a time coarse-graining approach which leaves us with a free timescale parameter, which we can optimize. Comparing this approach to the standard RWA-based Markovian master equation, we find that significantly better agreement is possible using the coarse-graining approach, for a three-level model coupled to a bath of oscillators, whose exact dynamics we can solve for at zero temperature. The model has the important feature that the RWA has a non-trivial effect on the dynamics of the populations. We show that the two different master equations can exhibit strong qualitative differences for the population of the energy eigenstates even for such a simple model. The RWA-based master equation misses an important feature which the coarse-graining based scheme does not. By optimizing the coarse-graining timescale the latter scheme can be made to approach the exact solution much more closely than the RWA-based master equation.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7013">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7013</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum percolation describes the problem of a quantum particle moving through a disordered system. While certain similarities to classical percolation exist, the quantum case has additional complexity due to the possibility of Anderson localisation. Here, we consider a directed discrete-time quantum walk as a model to study quantum percolation of a two-state particle on a two-dimensional lattice. Using numerical analysis we determine the fraction of connected edges required (transition point) in the lattice for the two-state particle to percolate with finite (non-zero) probability for three fundamental lattice geometries, finite square lattice, honeycomb lattice, and nanotube structure and show that it tends towards unity for increasing lattice sizes. To support the numerical results we also use a continuum approximation to analytically derive the expression for the percolation probability for the case of the square lattice and show that it agrees with the numerically obtained results for the discrete case. Beyond the fundamental interest to understand the dynamics of a two-state particle on a lattice (network) with disconnected vertices, our study has the potential to shed light on the transport dynamics in various quantum condensed matter systems and the construction of quantum information processing and communication protocols.

<blockquote>
<p>
Beam propagation beyond the paraxial approximation is studied in an optically written waveguide structure. The waveguide structure that leads to diffractionless light propagation, is imprinted on a medium consisting of a five-level atomic vapor driven by an incoherent pump and two coherent spatially dependent control and plane-wave fields. We first study propagation in a single optically written waveguide, and find that the paraxial approximation does not provide an accurate description of the probe propagation. We then employ coherent control fields such that two parallel and one tilted Gaussian beams produce a branched waveguide structure. The tilted beam allows selective steering of the probe beam into different branches of the waveguide structure. The transmission of the probe beam for a particular branch can be improved by changing the width of the titled Gaussian control beam as well as the intensity of the spatially dependent incoherent pump field.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate numerically parametrically driven coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations modelling the dynamics of coupled wavefields in a periodically oscillating double-well potential. The equations describe among other things two coupled periodically-curved optical waveguides with Kerr nonlinearity or horizontally shaken Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well magnetic trap. In particular, we study the persistence of equilibrium states of the undriven system due to the presence of the parametric drive. Using numerical continuations of periodic orbits and calculating the corresponding Floquet multipliers, we find that the drive can (de)stabilize a continuation of an equilibrium state indicated by the change of the (in)stability of the orbit. Hence, we show that parametric drives can provide a powerful control to nonlinear (optical or matter wave) field tunneling. Analytical approximations based on an averaging method are presented. Using perturbation theory the influence of the drive on the symmetry breaking bifurcation point is discussed.

We analyze efficiency of excitation energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes in transient and stationary setting. In the transient setting the absorption process is modeled as an individual event resulting in a subsequent relaxation dynamics. In the stationary setting the absorption is a continuous stationary process, leading to the nonequilibrium steady state. We show that, as far as the efficiency is concerned, both settings can be considered to be the same, as they result in almost identical efficiency. We also show that non-Markovianity has no effect on the resulting efficiency, i.e., corresponding Markovian dynamics results in identical efficiency. Even more, if one maps dynamics to appropriate classical rate equations, the same efficiency as in quantum case is obtained.

<blockquote>
<p>
An integrated optical dipole trap uses two-color (red and blue-detuned) traveling evanescent wave fields for trapping cold neutral atoms. To achieve longitudinal confinement, we propose using an integrated optical waveguide coupler, which provides a potential gradient along the beam propagation direction sufficient to confine atoms. This integrated optical dipole trap can support an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth due to its small mode area. Its quasi-TE0 waveguide mode has an advantage over the HE11 mode of a nanofiber, with little inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening at the trapping region. The longitudinal confinement eliminates the need for a 1-D optical lattice, reducing collisional blockaded atomic loading, potentially producing larger ensembles. The waveguide trap allows for scalability and integrability with nano-fabrication technology. We analyze the potential performance of such integrated atom traps.

Thinner ARs are technologically less demanding for epitaxial growth and result in reduced electrical heating of devices.

<blockquote>
<p>
One approach to the development of quantum search algorithms is the quantum walk. A spatial search can be effected by the continuous-time evolution of a single quantum particle on a graph containing a marked site. In many physical implementations, however, one might expect to have multiple particles. In interacting bosonic systems at zero temperature, the dynamics is well-described by a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We investigate the role of nonlinearity in determining the efficiency of the spatial search algorithm within the quantum walk model, for the complete graph. The analytical calculations reveal that the nonlinear search time scales with size of the search space N like the square root of N, equivalent to the linear case though with a different overall constant. The results indicate that interacting Bose-Einstein condensates at zero temperature could be natural systems for the implementation of the quantum search algorithm.

We demonstrate a critical transition from photon number growth to Bloch oscillations with periodical revivals of an arbitrary input state, associated with an increase of the effective phase mismatch between the pump and the squeezed photons.

<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum kinetic theory of the spin transfer between carriers and Mn atoms in a Mn doped diluted magnetic semiconductor is presented. It turns out that the typical memory time associated with these processes is orders of magnitude shorter than the time scale of the spin transfer. Nevertheless, Markovian rate equations, which are obtained by neglecting the memory, work well only for bulk systems. For quantum wells and wires the quantum kinetic results qualitatively deviate from the Markovian limit under certain conditions. Instead of a monotonic decay of an initially prepared excess electron spin, an overshoot or even coherent oscillations are found. It is demonstrated that these features are caused by energetic redistributions of the carriers due to the energy-time uncertainty.

We propose a combination of several concentric ring resonators, addressed with different bus guides, to generate arbitrary orbital angular momentum qudit states, which could potentially be used for classical and quantum communications. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that this device works as an orbital angular momentum sorter with an average cross-talk of -10 dB between different orbital angular momentum channels.

Based on the similarity of paraxial diffraction and dispersion mathematical descriptions, the temporal imaging of optical pulses combines linear dispersive filters and quadratic phase modulations operating as time lenses.

This filter is used in an approximate imaging scheme, combining a single time lens and a single dispersive section and operating as a time reversing device, with potential applications in radio-frequency signal processing. This scheme is closely related to three-pulse photon echo with chirped pulses but the connection with temporal imaging and dispersive filtering emphasizes new features.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a nonadiabatic approach to quantum annealing, in which we repeat quantum annealing in nonadiabatic time scales, and collect the final states of many realizations to find the ground state among them. In this way, we replace the diffculty of long annealing time in adiabatic quantum annealing by another problem of the number of nonsidabatic (short-time) trials. The one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model is used to test this idea, and it is shown that nonadiabatic quantum annealing has the same computational complexity to find the ground state as the conventional adiabatic annealing does. This result implies that the nonadiabatic method may be used to replace adiabatic annealing to avoid the effects of external disturbances, to which the adiabatic method is more prone than the nonadiabatic counterpart.

Entropies based on walks on graphs and on their line-graphs are defined. They are based on the summation over diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the thermal Green&#39;s function of a graph also known as the communicability.

They are not biased by the graph size and have significantly better correlation with the inverse participation ratio of the eigenmodes of the adjacency matrix than other graph entropies. The temperature dependence of the walk entropies is also discussed. In particular, the walk entropy of graphs is shown to be non-monotonic for regular but non-walk-regular graphs in contrast to non-regular graphs.

Open quantum random walks (OQRWs) deal with quantum random motions on the line for systems with internal and orbital degrees of freedom. The internal system behaves as a quantum random gyroscope coding for the direction of the orbital moves. We reveal the existence of a transition, depending on OQRW moduli, in the internal system behaviors from simple oscillations to random flips between two unstable pure states. This induces a transition in the orbital motions from usual diffusion to ballistically induced diffusion with large mean free path and large effective diffusion constant at large time. We also show that mixed states of the internal system are converted into random pure states during the process. We touch upon possible experimental realizations.
