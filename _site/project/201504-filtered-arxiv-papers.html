    <p><strong>1.    Modified and controllable dispersion interaction in a 1D waveguide geometry</strong><br>
Harald R. Haakh, Stefan Scheel<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00019">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00019</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dispersion interactions such as the van der Waals interaction between atoms or molecules derive from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and can be understood as the exchange of virtual photons between the interacting partners. Any modification of the environment in which those photons propagate will thus invariably lead to an alteration of the van der Waals interaction. Here we show how the two-body dispersion interaction inside a cylindrical waveguide can be made to decay asymptotically exponentially, and how this effect sensitively depends on the material properties and the length scales of the problem, eventually leading to the possibility of controllable interactions. Further, we discuss the possibility to detect the retarded van der Waals interaction by resonant enhancement of the interaction between Rydberg atoms in the light of long-range potentials due to guided modes.

<p><strong>2.    Adiabatic approximation for the imaginary-time Schroedinger equation and its application to simulated annealing</strong><br>
Kazuya Kaneko, Hidetoshi Nishimori<br>
J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 84, 094001 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00425">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00425</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We formulate an adiabatic approximation for the imaginary-time Schroedinger equation. The obtained adiabatic condition consists of two inequalities, one of which coincides with the conventional adiabatic condition for the real-time Schroedinger equation, but the other does not. We apply this adiabatic approximation to the analysis of Markovian dynamics of the classical Ising model, which can be formulated as the imaginary-time Schr\&quot;odinger equation, to obtain an asymptotic formula for the probability that the system reaches the ground state in the limit of a long annealing time in simulated annealing. Using this form, we amend the theory of Somma, Batista, and Ortiz for a convergence condition for simulated annealing.

<p><strong>3.    Non-Markovianity of Gaussian Channels</strong><br>
Gianpaolo Torre, Wojciech Roga, Fabrizio Illuminati<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00671">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00671</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a necessary and sufficient criterion for the non-Markovianity of Gaussian quantum dynamical maps based on the violation of divisibility. The criterion is derived by defining a general vectorial representation of the covariance matrix which is then exploited to determine the condition for the complete positivity of partial maps associated to arbitrary time intervals. Such construction does not rely on the existence of a Choi-Jamiolkowski representation and does not require optimization over states.

<p><strong>4.    Leaky modes of waveguides as a classical optics analogy of quantum resonances</strong><br>
Sara Cruz y Cruz, Oscar Rosas-Ortiz<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01008">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01008</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A classical optics waveguide structure is proposed to simulate resonances of short range one-dimensional potentials in quantum mechanics. The analogy is based on the well known resemblance between the guided and radiation modes of a waveguide with the bound and scattering states of a quantum well. As resonances are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the scatterer, we associate them with the leaky modes of a waveguide, the latter characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is complete since resonances (leaky modes) can be interpreted as bound states (guided modes) with definite lifetime (longitudinal shift). As an immediate application we calculate the leaky modes (resonances) associated with a dielectric homogeneous slab (square well potential) and show that these modes are attenuated as they propagate.

<p><strong>5.    An integrated source of broadband quadrature squeezed light</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01054">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01054</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
An integrated silicon nitride resonator is proposed as an ultra-compact source of bright single-mode quadrature squeezed light at 850 nm. Optical properties of the device are investigated and tailored through numerical simulations, with particular attention paid to loss associated with interfacing the device. An asymmetric double layer stack waveguide geometry with inverse vertical tapers is proposed for efficient and robust fibre-chip coupling, yielding a simulated total loss of -0.75 dB/facet. We assess the feasibility of the device through a full quantum noise analysis and derive the output squeezing spectrum for intra-cavity pump self-phase modulation. Subject to standard material loss and detection efficiencies, we find that the device holds promises for generating substantial quantum noise squeezing over a bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. In the low-propagation loss regime, approximately -7 dB squeezing is predicted for a pump power of only 50 mW.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum Computation with Topological Codes: from qubit to topological fault-tolerance</strong><br>
Keisuke Fujii<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01444">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01444</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a comprehensive review on fault-tolerant topological quantum computation with the surface codes. The basic concepts and useful tools underlying fault-tolerant quantum computation, such as universal quantum computation, stabilizer formalism, and measurement-based quantum computation, are also provided in a pedagogical way. Topological quantum computation by brading the defects on the surface code is explained in both circuit-based and measurement-based models in such a way that their relation is clear. The interdisciplinary connections between quantum error correction codes and subjects in other fields such as topological order in condensed matter physics and spin glass models in statistical physics are also discussed. This manuscript will be appeared in SpringerBriefs.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01602">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01602</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovianity has recently attracted large interest due to significant advances in its characterization and its exploitation for quantum information processing. However, up to now, only non-Markovian regimes featuring environment to system backflow of information (strong non-Markovianity) have been experimentally simulated. Here, we report an all-optical observation of the so-called weak non-Markovian dynamics. Through full process tomography, we experimentally demonstrate that the dynamics of a qubit can be non-Markovian despite an always increasing correlation between the system and its environment. We also show the transition from the weak to the strong regime by changing a single parameter in the environmental state, leading us to a better understanding of the fundamental features of non-Markovianity.

<p><strong>8.    Parametric instability of non-Hermitian systems near the exceptional point</strong><br>
Alexander A. Zyablovsky, Evgeny S. Andrianov, Alexander A. Pukhov<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01687">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01687</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In contrast to Hermitian systems, eigenstates of non-Hermitian ones are in general nonorthogonal. This feature is most pronounced at exceptional points where several eigenstates are linearly dependent. In this work we show that near this point a new effect takes place. It exhibits in energy increases in the system when its parameters change periodically. This effect resembles parametric resonance in a Hermitian system but there is a fundamental difference. It comes from the unique properties of the exceptional point that leads to parametric instability that occurs almost at any change in a parameter, while in the case of Hermitian systems it is necessary to fulfill resonance conditions. We illustrate this phenomenon by the case of two coupling waveguides with gain and loss. This phenomenon opens a wide range of applications in optics, plasmonics, and optoelectronics, where the loss is an inevitable problem and plays a crucial role.

<p><strong>9.    Direct generation of genuine single-longitudinal-mode narrowband photon pairs</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01854">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01854</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The practical prospect of quantum communication and information processing relies on sophisticated single photon pairs which feature controllable waveform, narrow spectrum, excellent purity, fiber compatibility and miniaturized design. For practical realizations, stable, miniaturized, low-cost devices are required. Sources with one or some of above performances have been demonstrated already, but it is quite challenging to have a source with all of the described characteristics simultaneously. Here we report on an integrated single-longitudinal-mode non-degenerate narrowband photon pair source, which exhibits all requirements needed for quantum applications. The device is composed of a periodically poled Ti-indiffused lithium niobate waveguide with high reflective dielectric mirror coatings deposited on the waveguide end-faces. Photon pairs with wavelengths around 890 nm and 1320 nm are generated via type II phase-matched parametric down-conversion. Clustering in this dispersive cavity restricts the whole conversion spectrum to one single-longitudinal-mode in a single cluster yielding a narrow bandwidth of only 60 MHz. The high conversion efficiency in the waveguide, together with the spectral clustering in the doubly resonant waveguide, leads to a high brightness of $3\times10^4~$pairs/(s$\cdot$mW$\cdot$MHz). This source exhibits prominent single-longitudinal-mode purity and remarkable temporal shaping capability. Especially, due to temporal broadening, we can observe that the coherence time of the two-photon component of PDC state is actually longer than the one of the single photon states. The miniaturized monolithic design makes this source have various fiber communication applications.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum Darwinism and non-Markovian dissipative dynamics from quantum phases of the spin-1/2 XX model</strong><br>
Gian Luca Giorgi, Fernando Galve, Roberta Zambrini<br>
Phys. Rev. A 92, 022105 (2015)<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02105">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02105</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of a classical description of objects in terms of the creation of many redundant registers in an environment containing their classical information. This amplification phenomenon, where only classical information reaches the macroscopic observer and through which different observers can agree on the objective existence of such object, has been revived lately for several types of situations, successfully explaining classicality. We explore quantum Darwinism in the setting of an environment made of two level systems which are initially prepared in the ground state of the XX model, which exhibits different phases; we find that the different phases have different ability to redundantly acquire classical information about the system, being the &quot;ferromagnetic phase&quot; the only one able to complete quantum Darwinism. At the same time we relate this ability to how non-Markovian the system dynamics is, based on the interpretation that non-Markovian dynamics is associated to back flow of information from environment to system, thus spoiling the information transfer needed for Darwinism. Finally, we explore mixing of bath registers by allowing a small interaction among them, finding that this spoils the stored information as previously found in the literature.

<p><strong>11.    Resource costs for fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computing</strong><br>
Ying Li, Peter C. Humphreys, Gabriel J. Mendoza, Simon C. Benjamin<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02457">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02457</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) seems attractively simple: information is borne entirely by light and processed by components such as beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors. However this very simplicity leads to limitations, such as the lack of deterministic entangling operations, which are compensated for by using substantial hardware overheads. Here we quantify the resource costs for full scale LOQC by proposing a specific protocol based on the surface code. With the caveat that our protocol can be further optimised, we report that the required number of physical components is at least five orders of magnitude greater than in comparable matter-based systems. Moreover the resource requirements grow higher if the per-component photon loss rate is worse than one in a thousand, or the per-component noise rate is worse than $10^{-5}$. We identify the performance of switches in the network as the single most influential factor influencing resource scaling.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02715">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02715</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we introduce quantum Latin squares, combinatorial quantum objects which generalize classical Latin squares, and investigate their applications in quantum computer science. Our main results are on applications to unitary error bases (UEBs), basic structures in quantum information which lie at the heart of procedures such as teleportation, dense coding and error correction. We present a new method for constructing a UEB from a quantum Latin square equipped with extra data. Developing construction techniques for UEBs has been a major activity in quantum computation, with three primary methods proposed: shift-and-multiply, Hadamard, and algebraic. We show that our new approach simultaneously generalizes the shift-and-multiply and Hadamard methods. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a UEB using our technique which we prove cannot be obtained from any of these existing methods.

<blockquote>
<p>
Superconducting systems have a long history of use in experiments that push the frontiers of mechanical sensing. This includes both applied and fundamental research, which at present day ranges from quantum computing research and efforts to explore Planck-scale physics to fundamental studies on the nature of motion and the quantum limits on our ability to measure it. In this paper, we first provide a short history of the role of superconducting circuitry and devices in mechanical sensing, focusing primarily on efforts in the last decade to push the study of quantum mechanics to include motion on the scale of human-made structures. This background sets the stage for the remainder of the paper, which focuses on the development of quantum electromechanical systems (QEMS) that incorporate superconducting quantum bits (qubits), superconducting transmission line resonators and flexural nanomechanical elements. In addition to providing the motivation and relevant background on the physical behavior of these systems, we discuss our recent efforts to develop a particular type of QEMS that is based upon the Cooper-pair box (CPB) and superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavities, a system which has the potential to serve as a testbed for studying the quantum properties of motion in engineered systems.

<blockquote>

We present a derivation of the Markovian master equation using the time coarse graining method. Starting from a naive perturbative solution of the von Neumann equation, the reduced density matrix with the coarse grained time steps is obtained using the assumption of short correlation time of the bath field. Then applying the renormalization group method, it is shown that dependence of the specific initial time in the solution can be removed and the Markovian semi-group master equation in Lindblad form is attained in the weak coupling limit.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03158">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03158</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Numerical methods for the 1-D Dirac equation based on operator splitting and on the quantum lattice Boltzmann (QLB) schemes are reviewed. It is shown that these discretizations fall within the class of quantum walks, i.e. discrete maps for complex fields, whose continuum limit delivers Dirac-like relativistic quantum wave equations. The correspondence between the quantum walk dynamics and these numerical schemes is given explicitly, allowing a connection between quantum computations, numerical analysis and lattice Boltzmann methods. The QLB method is then extended to the Dirac equation in curved spaces and it is demonstrated that the quantum walk structure is preserved. Finally, it is argued that the existence of this link between the discretized Dirac equation and quantum walks may be employed to simulate relativistic quantum dynamics on quantum computers.

Multi-photon interferences in complex multimode structures - quantum walks - are of both funda- mental and technological interest. They rely on the ability to design the complex network where the walk occurs.

Using the measured transmission matrix of the fiber, we demonstrate the ability to address arbitrary output modes of the two-photon speckle pattern, and simultaneous control of the quantum inter- ferences. This work provides a reconfigurable platform for multi-photon, multimode interference experiments and a route to high-dimensional quantum systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
A special configuration of graph state stabilizers, which contains only Pauli $\sigma_X$ operators, is studied. The vertex sets $\xi$ associated with such configurations are defined as what we call X-chains of graph states. The X-chains of a general graph state can be determined efficiently. They form a group structure such that one can obtain the explicit representation of graph states in the X-basis via the so-called X-chain factorization diagram. We show that graph states with different X-chain groups can have different probability distributions of X-measurement outcomes, which allows one to distinguish certain graph states with X-measurements. We provide an approach to find the Schmidt decomposition of graph states in the X-basis. The existence of X-chains in a subsystem facilitates error correction in the entanglement localization of graph states. In all of these applications, the difficulty of the task decreases with increasing number of X-chains. Furthermore, we show that the overlap of two graph states can be efficiently determined via X-chains, while its computational complexity with other known methods increases exponentially.

<blockquote>
<p>
Electron-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots plays a significant role in determining the optical properties of excited excitons, especially the spectral nature of emitted photons. This paper presents a comprehensive theory and analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled to structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons, when excited with incoherent pump fields. As specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose a Lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide, which are of current experimental interest. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare and contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat electron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian polaron master equation, a non-Markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear susceptibility approach, and we point out the limitations of these models. For the cavity-QED polaron master equation, we give closed form analytical solutions to the phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation approximation, fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning and cavity dot coupling. We show explicitly why the semiclassical linear susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon-mediated cavity feeding. For weakly coupled cavities, we calculate the optical spectra using a more general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above approaches in the low Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We subsequently use this general reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled to slow-light photonic crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of striking photon-phonon coupling effects. Our quantum theory can be applied to a wide range of photonic structures including photonic molecules and coupled-cavity waveguide systems.

<p>
Quantum states can be stabilized in the presence of intrinsic and environmental losses by either applying active feedback conditioned on an ancillary system or through reservoir engineering. Reservoir engineering maintains a desired quantum state through a combination of drives and designed entropy evacuation. We propose and implement a quantum reservoir engineering protocol that stabilizes Fock states in a microwave cavity. This protocol is realized with a circuit quantum electrodynamics platform where a Josephson junction provides direct, nonlinear coupling between two superconducting waveguide cavities. The nonlinear coupling results in a single photon resolved cross-Kerr effect between the two cavities enabling a photon number dependent coupling to a lossy environment. The quantum state of the microwave cavity is discussed in terms of a net polarization and is analyzed by a measurement of its steady state Wigner function.

<blockquote>
<p>
We characterize the set of generalized quantum measurements that can be decomposed into a continuous measurement process using a stream of probe qubits and a tunable interaction Hamilto- nian. Each probe in the stream interacts weakly with the target quantum system, then is measured projectively in a standard basis. This measurement result is used in a closed feedback loop to tune the interaction Hamiltonian for the next probe. The resulting evolution is a stochastic process with the structure of a one-dimensional random walk. To maintain this structure, and require that at long times the measurement outcomes be independent of the path, the allowed interaction Hamil- tonians must lie in a restricted set, such that the Hamiltonian terms on the target system form a finite dimensional Jordan algebra. This algebraic structure of the interaction Hamiltonians yields a large class of generalized measurements that can be continuously performed by our scheme, and we fully describe this set.

<blockquote>
<p>
A major goal for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is to reduce the overhead needed for error correction. One approach is to use block codes that encode multiple qubits, which can achieve significantly higher rates for the same code distance than single-qubit code blocks or topological codes. We present a scheme for universal quantum computation using multi-qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) block codes, where codes admitting different transversal gates are used to achieve universality, and logical teleportation is used to move qubits between code blocks. All circuits for both computation and error correction are transversal. We also argue that single shot fault-tolerant error correction can be done in Steane syndrome extraction. Then, we present estimates of information lifetime for a few possible codes, which suggests that highly nontrivial quantum computations can be achieved at reasonable error rates, using codes that require significantly less than 100 physical qubits per logical qubit.

<blockquote>
<p>
A common assumption in analyses of error thresholds and quantum computing in general is that one applies fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) after every gate. This, however, is known not to always be optimal if the FTQEC procedure itself can introduce errors. We investigate the effect of varying the number of logical gates between FTQEC operations, and in particular the case where failure of a postselection condition in FTQEC may cause FTQEC to be skipped with high probability. By using a simplified model of errors induced in FTQEC, we derive an expression for the logical error rate as a function of error-correction frequency, and show that in this model the optimal frequency is relatively insensitive to postselection failure probability for a large range of such probabilities. We compare the model to data derived from Monte Carlo simulation for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code.

<blockquote>
<p>
We focus on a family of quantum coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the analysis for the quantum case. We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming models on the optimization side. Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum and classical protocols, we show that only &quot;classical&quot; protocols can saturate Kitaev&#39;s lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of Alice and Bob&#39;s optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from attaining the optimal level of security.

In the theory of open quantum systems interaction is a fundamental concepts in the review of the dynamics of open quantum systems. Correlation, both classical and quantum one, is generated due to interaction between system and environment. Here, we recall the quantity which well known as total entropy production. Appearance of total entropy production is due to the entanglement production between system an environment. In this work, we discuss about the role of the total entropy production for detecting non-Markovianity. By utilizing the relation between total entropy production and total correlation between subsystems, one can see a temporary decrease of total entropy production is a signature of non-Markovianity.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a universal, on-chip quantum transducer based on surface acoustic waves in piezo-active materials. Because of the intrinsic piezoelectric (and/or magnetostrictive) properties of the material, our approach provides a universal platform capable of coherently linking a broad array of qubits, including quantum dots, trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy centers or superconducting qubits. The quantized modes of surface acoustic waves lie in the gigahertz range, can be strongly confined close to the surface in phononic cavities and guided in acoustic waveguides. We show that this type of surface acoustic excitations can be utilized efficiently as a quantum bus, serving as an on-chip, mechanical cavity-QED equivalent of microwave photons and enabling long-range coupling of a wide range of qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a complete classification of all possible sets of classical reversible gates acting on bits, in terms of which reversible transformations they generate, assuming swaps and ancilla bits are available for free. Our classification can be seen as the reversible-computing analogue of Post&#39;s lattice, a central result in mathematical logic from the 1940s. It is a step toward the ambitious goal of classifying all possible quantum gate sets acting on qubits. Our theorem implies a linear-time algorithm (which we have implemented), that takes as input the truth tables of reversible gates G and H, and that decides whether G generates H. Previously, this problem was not even known to be decidable. The theorem also implies that any n-bit reversible circuit can be &quot;compressed&quot; to an equivalent circuit, over the same gates, that uses at most 2^n*poly(n) gates and O(1) ancilla bits; these are the first upper bounds on these quantities known, and are close to optimal. Finally, the theorem implies that every non-degenerate reversible gate can implement either every reversible transformation, or every affine transformation, when restricted to an &quot;encoded subspace.&quot; Briefly, the theorem says that every set of reversible gates generates either all reversible transformations on n-bit strings (as the Toffoli gate does); no transformations; all transformations that preserve Hamming weight (as the Fredkin gate does); all transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod k for some k; all affine transformations (as the Controlled-NOT gate does); all affine transformations that preserve Hamming weight mod 2 or mod 4, inner products mod 2, or a combination thereof; or a previous class augmented by a NOT or NOTNOT gate. Ruling out the possibility of additional classes, not in the list, requires some arguments about polynomials, lattices, and Diophantine equations.

<blockquote>
<p>
Randomized benchmarking is an important statistical tool for characterising the performance of high-fidelity quantum gates. Here we study randomized benchmarking in the presence of quasi-static (i.e. low-frequency) errors. We contrast the resulting fidelity with that under the conventional assumption of Markovian errors. We treat these limiting cases analytically by mapping the averaging process to a random walk in &quot;Pauli space&quot;. In the quasi-static case, we find a broad, highly skewed distribution of fidelities, while Markovian errors produce a narrow, approximately Gaussian distribution of fidelities. We use the filter-transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these differences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in certain random sequences. Large skew in the distribution towards high-fidelity outcomes -- consistent with existing experimental data -- highlights potential finite-sampling pitfalls when deploying randomized benchmarking. Moreover, these results demonstrate general challenges in extracting useful single-gate fidelities from randomized benchmarking measurements with correlated errors.

<p>
Motivated by a model presented by S. Gudder, we study a quantum generalization of Markov chains and discuss the relation between these maps and open quantum random walks, a class of quantum channels described by S. Attal et al. We consider processes which are nonhomogeneous in time, i.e., at each time step, a possibly distinct evolution kernel. Inspired by a spectral technique described by L. Saloff-Coste and J. Z\&#39;u~niga, we define a notion of ergodicity for nonhomogeneous quantum Markov chains and describe a criterion for ergodicity of such objects in terms of singular values. As a consequence we obtain a quantum version of the classical probability result concerning the behavior of the columns (or rows) of the iterates of a stochastic matrix induced by a finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain. We are also able to relate the ergodic property presented here with the notions of weak and uniform ergodicity known in the literature of noncommutative $L^1$-spaces.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are interesting simple models for describing various fundamental processes in nature ranging from chaos or photosynthesis to universal quantum computation. Their implementation usually comprises a single particle and $O(n^2)$ optical elements, where $n$ is the size of the quantum walk space. The question arises if this can be achieved with fewer or complementary resources. Here we show that this can be done using a multi-particle Hong--Ou--Mandel interference. It employs $O(n)$ indistinguishable bosons and a single beam splitter to achieve a similar quantum walk. In addition we show that a quantum-to-classical transition takes place if the particles become distinguishable. This approach establishes a link between the fundamental indistinguishability of quantum particles and the wavelike coherent nature of the walk.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce and analyze a task that we call Markovianization, in which a tripartite quantum state is transformed to a quantum Markov chain by a randomizing operation on one of the three subsystems. We consider cases where the initial state is a tensor product of $n$ copies of a tripartite state $\rho^{ABC}$, and is transformed to a quantum Markov chain conditioned by $B^n$ with a small error, by a random unitary operation on $A^n$. In an asymptotic limit of infinite copies and vanishingly small error, we analyze the Markovianizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required for Markovianization. For tripartite pure states, we derive a single-letter formula for the Markovianizing costs. Counterintuitively, the Markovianizing cost is not a continuous function of states, and can be arbitrarily large even if the state is an approximate quantum Markov chain. Our results have an application for distributed quantum computation.

Transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems, ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices. It has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment. We report the first experimental demonstration of such environment-assisted quantum transport, using an engineered network of laser-written waveguides, with relative energies and inter-waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired Hamiltonian. Controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination, yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case. We show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target Hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence.

We prove that the Hadamard walk does not have any period except for his case, i.e., N=2, 4, 8. Our method is based on a path counting and cyclotomic polynomials which is different from his approach based on the property of eigenvalues for unitary matrix that determines the evolution of the walk.

<p>
We introduce with geometric means a density matrix decomposition of a multipartite quantum system of a finite dimension into two density matrices: a separable one, also known as the best separable approximation, and an essentially entangled one, which contains no product states components. We show that this convex decomposition can be achieved in practice with the help of an algorithm based on linear programming, which in the general case scales polynomially with the dimension of the multipartite system. Furthermore, we suggest methods for analyzing the multipartite entanglement content of the essentially entangled component and derive analytically an upper bound for its rank. We illustrate the algorithm at an example of a composed system of total dimension 12 undergoing loss of coherence due to classical noise and we trace the time evolution of its essentially entangled component. We suggest a &quot;geometric&quot; description of entanglement dynamics and show how it explains the well-known phenomena of sudden death and revival of multipartite entanglement.

Our results have important implications both in quantum thermodynamics and in quantum information theory.

<p>
Strong nonlinear interactions between photons enable logic operations for both classical and quantum-information technology. Unfortunately, nonlinear interactions are usually feeble and therefore all-optical logic gates tend to be inefficient. A quantum emitter deterministically coupled to a propagating mode fundamentally changes the situation, since each photon inevitably interacts with the emitter, and highly correlated many-photon states may be created . Here we show that a single quantum dot in a photonic-crystal waveguide can be utilized as a giant nonlinearity sensitive at the single-photon level. The nonlinear response is revealed from the intensity and quantum statistics of the scattered photons, and contains contributions from an entangled photon-photon bound state. The quantum nonlinearity will find immediate applications for deterministic Bell-state measurements and single-photon transistors and paves the way to scalable waveguide-based photonic quantum-computing architectures.

<p>
Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate numerical quantities which are hard to compute deterministically. One important example is the use in statistical physics of rapidly mixing Markov chains to approximately compute partition functions. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm which can accelerate Monte Carlo methods in a very general setting. The algorithm estimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomised or quantum subroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of quantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms with rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use multiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can also be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability distributions efficiently.

A Markov chain is a tripartite quantum state $\rho_{ABC}$ whose $C$-part can be recovered from the $B$-part only, i.e., there exists a recovery map $\mathcal{R}<em>{B \to BC}$ such that $\rho</em>{ABC} = \mathcal{R}<em>{B \to BC}(\rho</em>{AB})$. More generally, an approximate Markov chain $\rho_{ABC}$ is a state whose distance to the closest recovered state $\mathcal{R}<em>{B \to BC}(\rho</em>{AB})$ is small. As proved recently in [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664], this distance can be bounded from above by the conditional mutual information $I(A : C | B)$ of the state. While the proof is non-constructive, one may expect that the recovery is universal, in the sense that the same map $\mathcal{R}<em>{B \to BC}$ works for all states with a given marginal $\rho</em>{BC}$. Here we show that this is indeed the case.

Futhermore, we study the excitation of quantum states and their propagation under the effects of loss induced from the electronic degrees of freedom in the graphene. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to protect quantum information using quantum error correction techniques. We find that these techniques provide a robust-to-loss method for transferring quantum states of light in graphene over large distances.

We formulate Grover&#39;s unstructured search algorithm as a chiral quantum walk, where transitioning in one direction has a phase conjugate to transitioning in the opposite direction. For small phases, this breaking of time-reversal symmetry is too small to significantly affect the evolution: the system still approximately evolves in its ground and first excited states, rotating to the marked vertex in time $\pi \sqrt{N} / 2$. Increasing the phase does not change the runtime, but rather changes the support for the 2D subspace, so the system evolves in its first and second excited states, or its second and third excited states, and so forth. Apart from the critical phases corresponding to these transitions in the support, which become more frequent as the phase grows, this reveals that our model of quantum search is robust against time-reversal symmetry breaking.

We show that the Dirac quantum cellular automaton [Ann. Phys. 354 (2015) 244] shares many properties in common with the discrete-time quantum walk. These similarities can be exploited to redefine the automaton as a unitary process that takes place at regular time steps on a one-dimensional lattice with an arbitrary lattice spacing. In this way, it becomes an alternative to the quantum walk, with a dispersion relation that can be controlled by a mass parameter, playing a similar role to the coin angle in the quantum walk. Moreover, the Dirac Hamiltonian is recovered under a suitable limit. We also provide two independent analytical approximations to the long term probability distribution. It is shown that, starting from localized conditions, the asymptotic value of the entropy of entanglement between internal and motional degrees of freedom overcomes the known limit that is approached by the quantum walk for the same initial conditions, and are similar to the ones achieved by highly localized states of the Dirac equation.

Moreover, from the WKB approach, it is also shown that the degree of violation of the Bell inequality depends on the Wigner rotation angle obtained via the Fermi-Walker transport. Finally, the relativistic effects from the geometry of the spacetime and the accelerated motion of the correlated particles is discussed in the nonrelativistic limit.

<p>
Many quantum information tasks rely on entanglement, which is used as a resource, for example, to enable efficient and secure communication. Typically, noise, accompanied by loss of entanglement, reduces the efficiency of quantum protocols. We demonstrate experimentally a superdense coding scheme with noise, where the decrease of entanglement in Alice&#39;s encoding state does not reduce the efficiency of the information transmission. Having almost fully dephased classical two-photon polarization state at the time of encoding, we reach values of mutual information close to 1.52 (1.89) with 3-state (4-state) encoding. This high efficiency relies both on non-Markovian features, that Bob exploits just before his Bell-state measurement, and on very high visibility (99.6$\%$) of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference within the experimental set-up. Our proof-of-principle results pave the way for exploiting non-Markovianity to improve the efficiency and security of quantum information processing tasks.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the local quantum thermal susceptibility (LQTS) functional, which quantifies the best achievable accuracy for the temperature estimation of a composite system via local measurements. In this way we provide an operative strategy to address the local thermal response of arbitrary quantum systems at equilibrium. Our method relies on basic concepts of quantum estimation theory and is irrespective of the structure of thermal states. At low temperatures LQTS is an indicator of the local distinguishability of the ground-state with respect to the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a powerful method to identify, for example, quantum phase transitions.

<p><strong>50.    Average-case complexity versus approximate simulation of commuting quantum computations</strong><br>
Michael J. Bremner, Ashley Montanaro, Dan J. Shepherd<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.07999">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.07999</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We use the class of commuting quantum computations known as IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) to strengthen the conjecture that quantum computers are hard to simulate classically. We show that, if either of two plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then IQP computations are hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. One conjecture relates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition function for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns approximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe that both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case complexity. We arrive at these conjectures by deriving spin-based generalisations of the Boson Sampling problem that avoid the so-called permanent anticoncentration conjecture.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.08054">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.08054</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose to use efficient quantum error correcting codes with multilevel systems to protect encoded quantum information from erasure errors and efficient implementation to repetitively correct these errors. Our scheme makes use of quantum polynomial codes to encode quantum information and generalizes teleportation based error correction for multilevel systems to repetitively correct photon erasures and operation errors. We discuss the application of our scheme for one-way quantum repeaters and discuss their physical implementation using atom mediated multiqubit gates.

<p><strong>52.    Detecting Entanglement of Unknown Quantum States with Random Measurements</strong><br>
Jochen Szangolies, Hermann Kampermann, Dagmar Bru?<br>
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.08225">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.08225</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In quantum information theory, the reliable and effective detection of entanglement is of paramount importance. However, given an unknown state, assessing its entanglement is a challenging task. To attack this problem, we investigate the use of random local measurements, from which entanglement witnesses are then constructed via semidefinite programming methods. We propose a scheme of successively increasing the number of measurements until the presence of entanglement can be unambiguously concluded, and investigate its performance in various examples.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00483">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.00483</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We review an explicit regularization of the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence, that preserves all isometries of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. This scheme is useful to characterize the space of the unitary evolution operators that describe the dynamics of the microstates of extremal black holes in four spacetime dimensions. Using techniques from algebraic number theory to evaluate the transition amplitudes, we remark that the regularization scheme expresses the fast quantum computation capability of black holes as well as its chaotic nature.

<p><strong>54.    Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach to the microwave transmission through one- dimensional qubit chain</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the propagation of microwave photons in a one-dimensional waveguide interacting with a number of artificial atoms (qubits). Within the formalism of projection operators and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach we develop a one-photon approximation scheme for the calculation of the transmission and reflection factors of the microwave signal in a waveguide which contains an arbitrary number \emph{N} of non-interacting qubits. It is shown that for identical qubits in the long-wave limit a coherent superradiance state is formed with the width being equal to the sum of the widths of spontaneous transitions of \emph{N} individual qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (i.e., non-Hermitian) quantum system: it requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localisation, and dynamical properties. Using a spatially-structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies -- exceptional points. These are known to cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption, and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the nontrivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe the mode switching and topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which can lead to novel functionalities of polariton-based devices.

<p><strong>56.    Correlated Exciton Transport in Rydberg-Dressed-Atom Spin Chains</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01892">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.01892</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the transport of excitations through a chain of atoms with non-local dissipation introduced through coupling to additional short-lived states. The system is described by an effective spin-1/2 model where the ratio of the exchange interaction strength to the reservoir coupling strength determines the type of transport, including coherent exciton motion, incoherent hopping and a regime in which an emergent length scale leads to a preferred hopping distance far beyond nearest neighbors. For multiple impurities, the dissipation gives rise to strong nearest-neighbor correlations and entanglement. These results highlight the importance of non-trivial dissipation, correlations and many-body effects in recent experiments on the dipole-mediated transport of Rydberg excitations.

<p>
Solid-state microcavities combining ultra-small mode volume, wide-range resonance frequency tuning, as well as lossless coupling to a single mode fibre are integral tools for nanophotonics and quantum networks. We developed an integrated system providing all of these three indispensable properties. It consists of a nanofibre Bragg cavity (NFBC) with the mode volume of under 1 micro cubic meter and repeatable tuning capability over more than 20 nm at visible wavelengths. In order to demonstrate quantum light-matter interaction, we establish coupling of quantum dots to our tunable NFBC and achieve an emission enhancement by a factor of 2.7.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many-body interactions govern a variety of important quantum phenomena ranging from superconductivity and magnetism in condensed matter to solvent effects in chemistry. Understanding those interactions beyond mean field is a holy grail of modern sciences. AMO physics with advanced laser technologies has recently emerged as a new platform to study quantum many-body systems. One of its latest developments is the study of long-range interactions among ultracold particles to reveal the effects of many-body correlations. Rydberg atoms distinguish themselves by their large dipole moments and tunability of dipolar interactions. Most of ultracold Rydberg experiments have been performed with narrow-band lasers in the Rydberg blockade regime. Here we demonstrate an ultracold Rydberg gas in a complementary regime, where electronic coherence is created using a broadband picosecond laser pulse, thus circumventing the Rydberg blockade to induce strong many-body correlations. The effects of long-range Rydberg interactions have been investigated by time-domain Ramsey interferometry with attosecond precision. This approach allows for the real-time observation of coherent and ultrafast many-body dynamics in which the electronic coherence is modulated by the interaction-induced correlations. The modulation evolves more rapidly than expected for two-body correlations by several orders of magnitude. We have actively controlled such ultrafast many-body dynamics by tuning the principal quantum number and the population of the Rydberg state. The observed Ramsey interferograms are well reproduced by a theoretical model beyond mean-field approximation, which can be relevant to other similar many-body phenomena in condensed matter physics and chemistry. Our new approach opens a new avenue to observe and manipulate nonequilibrium dynamics of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on the ultrafast timescale.

<p><strong>59.    $\mathcal{PT}$-systems without parity symmetry: topological states, hidden symmetry, and the $\mathcal{PT}$ phase diagram</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03767">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.03767</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, until now, have been characterized by a real, parity-symmetric, kinetic Hamiltonian and a non-Hermitian, balanced gain-loss potential. We present a new class of discrete models in which the tunneling Hamiltonian is not parity-symmetric, and yet the models have a nonzero $\mathcal{PT}$-breaking threshold in presence of a pair of gain-loss impurities $\pm i\gamma$ located at reflection-symmetric sites. We uncover a hidden symmetry that is instrumental to the finite threshold strength. We show that such models have topological edge-states that remain robust in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase. Our predictions substantially broaden possible realizations of a $\mathcal{PT}$ system, particularly in optical waveguide arrays or coupled microstructures, by eliminating the parity-symmetry constraint.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04230">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04230</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this letter we present, in a number conserving framework, a model of interacting fermions in a two-wire geometry supporting non-local zero-energy Majorana-like edge excitations. The model has an exactly solvable line, on varying the density of fermions, described by a topologically non-trivial ground state wave-function. Away from the exactly solvable line we study the system by means of the numerical density matrix renormalization group. We characterize its topological properties through the explicit calculation of a degenerate entanglement spectrum and of the braiding operators which are exponentially localized at the edges. Furthermore, we establish the presence of a gap in its single particle spectrum while the Hamiltonian is gapless, and compute the correlations between the edge modes as well as the superfluid correlations. The topological phase covers a sizeable portion of the phase diagram, the solvable line being one of its boundaries.

<p><strong>61.    Quantum Noise of Free-Carrier Dispersion in Semiconductor Optical Cavities</strong><br>

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04409">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04409</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper derives Langevin equations for an optical cavity where the dominant nonlinearity arises from free-carrier dispersion. We define a generalized Wigner function, compute a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the master equation, and convert this to a system of stochastic differential equations. These equations are similar to the Wigner equations for an optical Kerr cavity, but have additional noise terms due to the incoherent carrier excitation and decay processes. We use these equations to simulate a phase-sensitive amplifier and latch and compare the results to a Kerr model.

<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04410">http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1504.04410</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
At strong pump powers, a semiconductor optical cavity passes through a Hopf bifurcation and undergoes self-oscillation. We simulate this device using semiclassical Langevin equations and assess the effect of quantum fluctuations on the dynamics. Below threshold, the cavity acts as a phase-insensitive linear amplifier, with noise $\sim 5\times$ larger than the Caves bound. Above threshold, the limit cycle acts as an analog memory, and the phase diffusion is $\sim 10\times$ larger than the bound set by the standard quantum limit. We also simulate entrainment of this oscillator and propose an optical Ising machine and classical CNOT gate based on the effect.

We explore the microwave radiation emitted from a biased double quantum dot due to the inelastic tunneling of single charges. Radiation is detected over a broad range of detuning configurations between the dot energy levels with pronounced maxima occurring in resonance with a capacitively coupled transmission line resonator. The power emitted for forward and reverse resonant detuning is found to be in good agreement with a rate equation model, which considers the hybridization of the individual dot charge states.
