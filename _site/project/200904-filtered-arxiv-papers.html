    <p><strong>1.    The impact of classical electronics constraints on a solid-state logical qubit memory</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a fault-tolerant memory for an error-corrected logical qubit based on silicon double quantum dot physical qubits. Our design accounts for constraints imposed by supporting classical electronics. A significant consequence of the constraints is to add error-prone idle steps for the physical qubits. Even using a schedule with provably minimum idle time, for our noise model and choice of error-correction code, we find that these additional idles negate any benefits of error correction. Using additional qubit operations, we can greatly suppress idle-induced errors, making error correction beneficial, provided the qubit operations achieve an error rate less than $2 \times 10^{-5}$. We discuss other consequences of these constraints such as error-correction code choice and physical qubit operation speed. While our analysis is specific to this memory architecture, the methods we develop are general enough to apply to other architectures as well.

<blockquote>
<p>
A design for an ultra-high Q photonic crystal nanocavity engineered to interact with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers located near the surface of a single crystal diamond sample is presented. The structure is based upon a nanowire photonic crystal geometry, and consists of a patterned high refractive index membrane, such as gallium phosphide (GaP), supported by a diamond substrate. The nanocavity supports a mode with quality factor Q &gt; 1.5 million and mode volume V &lt; 0.52 (\lambda/n_\text{GaP})^3, and promises to allow Purcell enhanced collection of spontaneous emission from an NV located more than 50 nm below the diamond surface. The nanowire photonic crystal waveguide can be used to efficiently couple light into and out of the cavity, or as an efficient broadband collector of NV phonon sideband emission. The proposed structures can be fabricated using existing materials and processing techniques.

<p><strong>4.    Performance of quantum data transmission systems in the presence of thermal noise</strong><br>
G. Cariolaro, G. Pierobon<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1073">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1073</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the literature the performance of quantum data transmission systems is usually evaluated in the absence of thermal noise. A more realistic approach taking into account the thermal noise is intrinsically more difficult because it requires dealing with Glauber coherent states in an infinite--dimensional space. In particular, the exact evaluation of the optimal measurement operators is a very difficult task, and numerical approximation is unavoidable. The paper faces the problem by approximating the P-representation of the noisy quantum states with a large but finite number of terms and applying to them the square root measurement (SRM) approach. Comparisons with the exact solution obtained with convex semidefinite programming show that the SRM approach gives quite accurate results. As application, the performance of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) systems is considered. In spite of the fact that the SRM approach is not optimal and overestimates the error probability, also in these cases the quantum detection maintains its superiority with respect to the classical homodyne detection.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum walk on a line for a trapped ion</strong><br>

<p>
We show that a multi-step quantum walk can be realized for a single trapped ion with interpolation between quantum and random walk achieved by randomizing the generalized Hadamard coin flip phase. The signature of the quantum walk is manifested not only in the ion&#39;s position but also its phonon number, which makes an ion trap implementation of the quantum walk feasible.

<blockquote>
<p>
Given a verifier circuit for a problem in QMA, we show how to exponentially amplify the gap between its acceptance probabilities in the <code>yes&#39; and</code>no&#39; cases, with a method that is quadratically faster than the procedure given by Marriott and Watrous. Our construction is natively quantum, based on the analogy of a product of two reflections and a quantum walk. Second, in some special cases we show how to amplify the acceptance probability for good witnesses to 1, making a step towards the proof that QMA with one-sided error is equal to QMA. Finally, we simplify the filter-state method to search for QMA witnesses by Poulin and Wocjan.

<p><strong>7.    Non-Markovian Dynamics of Entanglement for Multipartite Systems</strong><br>
Jiang Zhou, Chengjun Wu, Mingyi Zhu, Hong Guo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1658">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1658</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement dynamics for a couple of two-level atoms interacting with independent structured reservoirs is studied using a non-perturbative approach. It is shown that the revival of atom entanglement is not necessarily accompanied by the sudden death of reservoir entanglement, and vice versa. In fact, atom entanglement can revive before, simultaneously or even after the disentanglement of reservoirs. Using a novel method based on the population analysis for the excited atomic state, we present the quantitative criteria for the revival and death phenomena. For giving a more physically intuitive insight, the quasimode Hamiltonian method is applied. Our quantitative analysis is helpful for the practical engineering of entanglement.

<p><strong>8.    Slow Light of an Amplitude Modulated Gaussian Pulse in Cesium Vapor</strong><br>
Wenzhuo Tang, Bin Luo, Yu Liu, Hong Guo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1779">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1779</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Slow light of an amplitude modulated Gaussian (AMG) pulse in cesium vapor is demonstrated and studied, as an appropriate amplitude modulation to a single pulse can expand its spectrum and thus increase the utilization efficiency of the bandwidth of a slow light system. In a single-$\Lambda$ type electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system, the slowed AMG pulse experiences severe distortion, mainly owing to the frequency dependent transmission of medium. Additionally, due to its spectral distribution, the frequency dependent dispersion of the medium causes simultaneous slow and fast light of different spectral components and thus a certain dispersive distortion of the AMG pulse. Further, a post-processing method is proposed to recover the slowed (distorted) pulse, which indicates that by introducing a linear optical system with a desired gain spectrum we can recover the pulse in an &quot;all-optical&quot; way. Finally, we discuss the limitations during this compensation procedure in detail. Although it is demonstrated in the cesium vapor using EIT, this method should be applicable to a wide range of slow light systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we show that by suitably tailoring the dispersion characteristics of a Bragg reflection waveguide (BRW) mode, it is possible to achieve efficient photon pair generation over a large pump bandwidth while maintaining narrow signal bandwidth. The structure proposed consists of a high index core BRW with a periodically poled GaN core and periodically stratified cladding made up of alternate layers of $Al_{0.02}Ga_{0.98}N$ and $Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N$. Such photon-pair generators should find applications in realizing compact and stable sources for quantum information processing.

<p>
We study the effect of small decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks on long-range interacting cycles, which are constructed by connecting all the two nodes of distance m on the cycle graph. In our investigation, each node is continuously monitored by an individual point contact, which induces the decoherence process. We obtain the analytical probability distribution and the mixing time upper bound. Our results show that, for small rates of decoherence, themixing time upper bound is independent of distance parameter m and is proportional to inverse of decoherence rate.

<p><strong>11.    Adaptive Measurements in the Optical Quantum Information Laboratory</strong><br>

IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron., 15, 1661-1672 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2045">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2045</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Adaptive techniques make practical many quantum measurements that would otherwise be beyond current laboratory capabilities. For example: they allow discrimination of nonorthogonal states with a probability of error equal to the Helstrom bound; they allow measurement of the phase of a quantum oscillator with accuracy approaching (or in some cases attaining) the Heisenberg limit; and they allow estimation of phase in interferometry with a variance scaling at the Heisenberg limit, using only single qubit measurement and control. Each of these examples has close links with quantum information, in particular experimental optical quantum information: the first is a basic quantum communication protocol; the second has potential application in linear optical quantum computing; the third uses an adaptive protocol inspired by the quantum phase estimation algorithm. We discuss each of these examples, and their implementation in the laboratory, but concentrate upon the last, which was published most recently [Higgins {\em et al.}, Nature vol. 450, p. 393, 2007].

In the recipe, the probability of observing particle on direct product of graph obtain by multiplication of probability on the corresponding to sub-graphs, where this method is useful to determine probability of walk on complicated graphs. Using this method, we calculate the probability of continuous-time classical and quantum random walks on many of finite direct product cayley graphs (complete cycle, complete $K_n$, charter and $n$-cube). Also, we inquire that the classical state the stationary uniform distribution is reached as $t\longrightarrow \infty$ but for quantum state is not always satisfy.

This paper generalizes and expands upon the work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 070502 (2009)] where we introduced a scheme for fault-tolerant holonomic quantum computation (HQC) on stabilizer codes. HQC is an all-geometric strategy based on non-Abelian adiabatic holonomies, which is known to be robust against various types of errors in the control parameters. The scheme we present shows that HQC is a scalable method of computation, and opens the possibility for combining the benefits of error correction with the inherent resilience of the holonomic approach. We show that with the Bacon-Shor code the scheme can be implemented using Hamiltonian operators of weight 2 and 3.

<blockquote>
<p>
Arbitrary exponentially large unitaries cannot be implemented efficiently by quantum circuits. However, we show that quantum circuits can efficiently implement any unitary provided it has at most polynomially many nonzero entries in any row or column, and these entries are efficiently computable. One can formulate a model of computation based on the composition of sparse unitaries which includes the quantum Turing machine model, the quantum circuit model, anyonic models, permutational quantum computation, and discrete time quantum walks as special cases. Thus we obtain a simple unified proof that these models are all contained in BQP. Furthermore our general method for implementing sparse unitaries simplifies several existing quantum algorithms.

<p><strong>16.    An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</strong><br>
Daniel Gottesman<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2557">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2557</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.

The properties of the QFT over Galois rings lead to the quantum algorithm for hidden linear structures over Galois rings.

<p>
Grover search is a well-known quantum algorithm that outperforms any classical search algorithm. It is known that quantum correlations such as entanglement are necessary for the power of quantum computation. But entanglement is not the only kind of quantum correlations. Other quantum correlations such as quantum discord are also useful to capture some aspects of the nonclassical correlation. We investigate several kinds of correlations including both quantum and classical in the whole process of Grover search algorithm. These correlations are the concurrence, entanglement of formation, quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information. The behaviors of quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information are almost the same while the concurrence is different. When the search is over, all kinds of correlations are zero, we argue that this is necessary for the final step in the search.

<p><strong>20.    Span programs and quantum query complexity: The general adversary bound is nearly tight for every boolean function</strong><br>
Ben W. Reichardt<br>
Extended abstract in Proc. 50th IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2009, pages 544-551<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2759">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2759</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The general adversary bound is a semi-definite program (SDP) that lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower bound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual SDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a logarithmic factor. In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on &quot;span programs,&quot; a certain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that outputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal &quot;witness size.&quot; The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general adversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span programs with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size. The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed span programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large class of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for which there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been found in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly, the SDP&#39;s value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal quantum algorithm for evaluating &quot;balanced&quot; formulas over any finite boolean gate set. The second result extends span programs&#39; applicability beyond the formula evaluation problem. A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query algorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although nearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising model for developing more quantum algorithms.

<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement properties of photon pairs generated in a nonlinear, periodically poled, two-mode waveguide (1-D planar or 2-D circular) via nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Any of the possible degrees of freedom -- mode number, frequency, or polarization -- can be used to distinguish the down-converted photons while the others serve as attributes of entanglement. Distinguishing the down-converted photons based on their mode numbers enables us to efficiently generate spectral or polarization entanglement that is either narrowband or broadband. On the other hand, when the generated photons are distinguished by their frequencies in a Type-0 process, modal entanglement turns out to be an efficient alternative to polarization entanglement. Moreover, modal entanglement in Type-II down-conversion may be used to generate a doubly entangled state in frequency and polarization.

<p>
We implement the proof of principle for the quantum walk of one ion in a linear ion trap. With a single-step fidelity exceeding 0.99, we perform three steps of an asymmetric walk on the line. We clearly reveal the differences to its classical counterpart if we allow the walker/ion to take all classical paths simultaneously. Quantum interferences enforce asymmetric, non-classical distributions in the highly entangled degrees of freedom (of coin and position states). We theoretically study and experimentally observe the limitation in the number of steps of our approach, that is imposed by motional squeezing. We propose an altered protocol based on methods of impulsive steps to overcome these restrictions, in principal allowing to scale the quantum walk to several hundreds of steps.

<p><strong>26.    On the Theory of Casimir-Polder Forces</strong><br>
Bo-Sture Skagerstam, Per Kristian Rekdal, Asle Heide Vaskinn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 80, 022902 (2009)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the energy shift for an atom close to a non-magnetic body with a magnetic moment coupled to a quantized magnetic field. The corresponding repulsive Casimir-Polder force is obtained for a perfect conductor, a metal, a dielectric medium, with dielectric properties modeled by a Drude formula, and a superconductor at zero temperature. The dielectric properties of the superconductor is obtained by making use of the Mattis-Bardeen linear response theory and we present some useful expressions for the low-frequency conductivity. The quantum dynamics with a given initial state is discussed in terms of the well-known Weisskopf-Wigner theory and is compared with corresponding results for a electric dipole coupling. The results obtained are compatible with a conventional master equation approach. In order to illustrate the dependence on geometry and material properties, numerical results are presented for the ground state using a two-level approximation.

<p><strong>27.    Experimental characterization of three-wave mixing in a multimode nonlinear KTiOPO_4 waveguide</strong><br>
Michal Karpinski, Czeslaw Radzewicz, Konrad Banaszek<br>
Appl. Phys. Lett. 94, 181105 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4577">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4577</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report experimental determination of the phase-matching function for type-II three-wave mixing in a periodically poled KTiOPO_4 waveguide in the 792-815 nm spectral region. The measurement was performed by sum-frequency generation of spectrally tuned fundamental components. Strong dependence of the observed signal on the excited spatial modes in the waveguide has been observed and fully interpreted. These results indicate a route to employ the waveguide for spontaneous parametric down-conversion producing photon pairs in well-defined spatial modes.

<p><strong>28.    Spatial modes in waveguided parametric down-conversion</strong><br>
Andreas Christ, Kaisa Laiho, Andreas Eckstein, Thomas Lauckner, Peter J. Mosley, Christine Silberhorn<br>
Phys. Rev. A 80, 033829 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4668">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4668</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The propagation of several spatial modes has a significant impact on the structure of the emission from parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear waveguide. This manifests itself not only in the spatial correlations of the photon pairs but also, due to new phase-matching conditions, in the output spectrum, radically altering the degree of entanglement within each pair. Here we investigate both theoretically and experimentally the results of higher-order spatial-mode propagation in nonlinear waveguides. We derive conditions for the creation of pairs in these modes and present observations of higher-order mode propagation in both the spatial and spectral domains. Furthermore, we observe correlations between the different degrees of freedom and finally we discuss strategies for mitigating any detrimental effects and optimizing pair production in the fundamental mode.

<p><strong>29.    Capacitance measurements and electrostatic calibrations in experiments measuring the Casimir force</strong><br>
R. S. Decca, E. Fischbach, G. L. Klimchitskaya, D. E. Krause, D. López, U. Mohideen, V. M. Mostepanenko<br>
Int. J. Mod. Phys. A, v.26, N22, pp.3930-3943 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4720">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4720</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We compare the results of capacitance measurements in the lens-plane and sphere-plane configurations with theoretical predictions from various models of a spherical surface. It is shown that capacitance measurements are incapable of discriminating between models of perfect and modified spherical surfaces in an experiment demonstrating the anomalous scaling law for the electric force. Claims to the contrary in the recent literature are explained by the use of irregular comparison. The data from capacitance measurements in an experiment measuring the Casimir force using a micromechanical torsional oscillator are shown to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions using the model of a perfect spherical surface.

<p><strong>30.    Quantum Smoluchowski equation for driven systems</strong><br>
Raoul Dillenschneider, Eric Lutz<br>
Phys. Rev. E 80, 042101 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0950">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0950</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a driven quantum harmonic oscillator strongly coupled to a heat bath. Starting from the exact quantum Langevin equation, we use a Green&#39;s function approach to determine the corresponding semiclassical equation for the Wigner phase space distribution. In the limit of high friction, we apply Brinkman&#39;s method to derive the quantum Smoluchowski equation for the probability distribution in position space. We further determine the range of validity of the equation and discuss the special case of a Brownian parametric oscillator.

<p><strong>31.    Efficient spectroscopy of single embedded emitters using optical fiber taper waveguides</strong><br>
Marcelo Davanco, Kartik Srinivasan<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2732">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2732</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A technique based on using optical fiber taper waveguides for probing single emitters embedded in thin dielectric membranes is assessed through numerical simulations. For an appropriate membrane geometry, photoluminescence collection efficiencies in excess of 10 % are predicted, exceeding the efficiency of standard free-space collection by an order of magnitude. Our results indicate that these fiber taper waveguides offer excellent prospects for performing efficient spectroscopy of single emitters embedded in thin films, such as a single self-assembled quantum dot in a semiconductor membrane.

<p><strong>32.    Quantum walk on the line with quantum rings</strong><br>
Orsolya Kálmán, Tamás Kiss, Péter F?ldi<br>
Phys. Rev. B 80, 035327 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4588">http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4588</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme to implement the one-dimensional coined quantum walk with electrons transported through a two-dimensional network of spintronic semiconductor quantum rings. The coin degree of freedom is represented by the spin of the electron, while the discrete position of the walker corresponds to the label of the rings in one of the spatial directions in the network. We assume that Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction is present in the rings, the strength of which can be tuned by an external electric field. The geometry of the device, together with the appropriate spin-orbit interaction strengths, ensure the realization of the coin-toss (i.e. spin-flip) and the step operator.
