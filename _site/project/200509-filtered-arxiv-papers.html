    <p><strong>1.    Feedback cooling of atomic motion in cavity QED</strong><br>
Daniel A. Steck, Kurt Jacobs, Hideo Mabuchi, Salman Habib, Tanmoy Bhattacharya<br>
Phys. Rev. A 74, 012322 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509039">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509039</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of controlling the motion of an atom trapped in an optical cavity using continuous feedback. In order to realize such a scheme experimentally, one must be able to perform state estimation of the atomic motion in real time. While in theory this estimate may be provided by a stochastic master equation describing the full dynamics of the observed system, integrating this equation in real time is impractical. Here we derive an approximate estimation equation for this purpose, and use it as a drive in a feedback algorithm designed to cool the motion of the atom. We examine the effectiveness of such a procedure using full simulations of the cavity QED system, including the quantized motion of the atom in one dimension.

<p><strong>2.    Impact of positivity and complete positivity on accessibility of Markovian dynamics</strong><br>
Raffaele Romano<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509041">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509041</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a two-dimensional quantum control system evolving under an entropy-increasing irreversible dynamics in the semigroup form. Considering a phenomenological approach to the dynamics, we show that the accessibility property of the system depends on whether its evolution is assumed to be positive or completely positive. In particular, we characterize the family of maps having different accessibility and show the impact of that property on observable quantities by means of a simple physical model.

<p><strong>3.    Coulomb entangler and entanglement testing network for waveguide qubits</strong><br>
Linda E. Reichl, Michael G. Snyder<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509043">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509043</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a small network for the testing of the entanglement of two ballistic electron waveguide qubits. The network produces different output conditional on the presence or absence of entanglement. The structure of the network allows for the determination of successful entanglement operations through the measurement of the output of a single qubit. We also present a simple model of a dynamic coulomb-like interaction and use it to describe some characteristics of a proposed scheme for the entanglement of qubits in ballistic electron waveguides.

<p><strong>4.    A Quantum Logic Array Microarchitecture: Scalable Quantum Data Movement and Computation</strong><br>
Tzvetan S. Metodi, Darshan D. Thaker, Andrew W. Cross, Frederic T. Chong, Isaac L. Chuang<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509051">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509051</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Recent experimental advances have demonstrated technologies capable of supporting scalable quantum computation. A critical next step is how to put those technologies together into a scalable, fault-tolerant system that is also feasible. We propose a Quantum Logic Array (QLA) microarchitecture that forms the foundation of such a system. The QLA focuses on the communication resources necessary to efficiently support fault-tolerant computations. We leverage the extensive groundwork in quantum error correction theory and provide analysis that shows that our system is both asymptotically and empirically fault tolerant. Specifically, we use the QLA to implement a hierarchical, array-based design and a logarithmic expense quantum-teleportation communication protocol. Our goal is to overcome the primary scalability challenges of reliability, communication, and quantum resource distribution that plague current proposals for large-scale quantum computing.

<p><strong>6.    Mixing of Quantum Walk on Circulant Bunkbeds</strong><br>
P. Lo, S. Rajaram, D. Schepens, D. Sullivan, C. Tamon, J. Ward<br>
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 6, No. 4&amp;5 (2006), pages 370-381.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509059">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509059</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give new observations on the mixing dynamics of a continuous-time quantum walk on circulants and their bunkbed extensions. These bunkbeds are defined through two standard graph operators: the join G + H and the Cartesian product of graphs G and H.Our results include the following: 1. The quantum walk is average uniform mixing on circulants with bounded eigenvalue multiplicity. This extends a known fact about the cycles. 2. Explicit analysis of the probability distribution of the quantum walk on the join of circulants. This explains why complete partite graphs are not average uniform mixing, using the fact the complete n-vertex graph is the join of a 1-vertex graph and the (n-1)-vertex complete graph, and that the complete m-partite graph, where each partition has size n, is the m-fold join of the empty n-vertex graph. 3. The quantum walk on the Cartesian product of a m-vertex path P and a circulant G, is average uniform mixing if G is. This highlights a difference between circulants and the hypercubes. Our proofs employ purely elementary arguments based on the spectra of the graphs.

<p><strong>7.    Feed-forward and its role in conditional linear optical quantum dynamics</strong><br>
S. Scheel, W.J. Munro, J. Eisert, K. Nemoto, P. Kok<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73, 034301 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509075">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509075</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nonlinear optical quantum gates can be created probabilistically using only single photon sources, linear optical elements and photon-number resolving detectors. These gates are heralded but operate with probabilities much less than one. There is currently a large gap between the performance of the known circuits and the established upper bounds on their success probabilities. One possibility for increasing the probability of success of such gates is feed-forward, where one attempts to correct certain failure events that occurred in the gate&#39;s operation. In this brief report we examine the role of feed-forward in improving the success probability. In particular, for the non-linear sign shift gate, we find that in a three-mode implementation with a single round of feed-forward the optimal average probability of success is approximately given by p= 0.272. This value is only slightly larger than the general optimal success probability without feed-forward, P= 0.25.

<p><strong>9.    Quantum computing (Kwantumberekening)</strong><br>
W.L. Fouché, J. Heidema, P.H. Potgieter<br>
Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif vir Natuurwetenskap en Tegnologie (ISSN 0254-3486), Vol 24, Issue 3, September, 60-83 (2005)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509118">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509118</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
There has been no lack of coverage in the past few years in scientific journals of the topic of quantum computation. Rightly so, as this is a novel idea with--so far--at least one very important practical application (prime factorisation) as soon as the technology can accommodate reasonably sized computations. Interest in quantum computing has been sparked by both the realization that increasing miniaturisation will eventually bring computer scientists face-to-face with quantum effects, and by the grasping of the potential for massive parallelism inherent in the Hilbert space representation of quantum systems and in the special effects of quantum entanglement.

<p><strong>10.    Continuous time quantum walks in phase space</strong><br>
Oliver Muelken, Alexander Blumen<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73, 012105 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509141">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509141</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We formulate continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) in a discrete quantum mechanical phase space. We define and calculate the Wigner function (WF) and its marginal distributions for CTQWs on circles of arbitrary length $N$. The WF of the CTQW shows characteristic features in phase space. Revivals of the probability distributions found for continuous and for discrete quantum carpets do manifest themselves as characteristic patterns in phase space.

<p><strong>11.    Mixing and Decoherence in Continuous-Time Quantum Walks on Cycles</strong><br>
Leonid Fedichkin, Dmitry Solenov, Christino Tamon<br>
Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 6, No. 3 (2006), 263-276.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509163">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509163</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove analytical results showing that decoherence can be useful for mixing time in a continuous-time quantum walk on finite cycles. This complements the numerical observations by Kendon and Tregenna (Physical Review A 67 (2003), 042315) of a similar phenomenon for discrete-time quantum walks. Our analytical treatment of continuous-time quantum walks includes a continuous monitoring of all vertices that induces the decoherence process. We identify the dynamics of the probability distribution and observe how mixing times undergo the transition from quantum to classical behavior as our decoherence parameter grows from zero to infinity. Our results show that, for small rates of decoherence, the mixing time improves linearly with decoherence, whereas for large rates of decoherence, the mixing time deteriorates linearly towards the classical limit. In the middle region of decoherence rates, our numerical data confirms the existence of a unique optimal rate for which the mixing time is minimized.

<p><strong>12.    Spacetime path formalism: localized states</strong><br>
Ed Seidewitz<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509182">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509182</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This note is an addendum to quant-ph/0507115. In that paper, I present a formalism for relativistic quantum mechanics in which the spacetime paths of particles are considered fundamental, reproducing the standard results of the traditional formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Now, it is well known that there are issues with the ability to localize the position of particles in the usual formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. The present note shows how, in the spacetime path formalism, the natural representation of on-shell 3-momentum states is effectively a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the traditional representation, addressing the localization issues of position states and, further, providing a straightforward non-relativistic limit.

<p>
We report on the generation of photon pairs in the 1550-nm band suitable for long-distance fiber-optic quantum key distribution. The photon pairs were generated in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a high conversion-efficiency. Using a pulsed semiconductor laser with a pulse rate of 800 kHz and a maximum average pump power of 50 muW, we obtained a coincidence rate of 600 s^-1. Our measurements are in agreement with a Poissonian photon-pair distribution, as is expected from a comparison of the coherence time of the pump and of the detected photons. An average of 0.9 photon pairs per pulse was obtained.

<p><strong>15.    An algorithm to perform POVMs through Neumark theorem: application to the discrimination of non-orthogonal pure quantum states</strong><br>
Wilson R. M. Rabelo, Alexandre G. Rodrigues, Reinaldo O. Vianna<br>
International Journal of Modern Physics C, 17, 1203-1218 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509191">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509191</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a protocol to perform the optimal quantum state discrimination of $N$ linearly independent non-orthogonal pure quantum states and present a computational code. Through the extension of the original Hilbert space, it is possible to perform an unitary operation yielding a final configuration, which gives the best discrimination without ambiguity by means of von Neumann measurements. Our goal is to introduce a detailed general mathematical procedure to realize this task by means of semidefinite programming and norm minimization. The former is used to fix which is the best detection probability amplitude for each state of the ensemble. The latter determines the matrix which leads the states to the final configuration. In a final step, we decompose the unitary transformation in a sequence of two-level rotation matrices.

<p><strong>16.    Quantum Algorithm for Commutativity Testing of a Matrix Set</strong><br>
Yuki Kelly Itakura<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509206">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509206</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose we have k matrices of size n by n. We are given an oracle that knows all the entries of k matrices, that is, we can query the oracle an (i,j) entry of the l-th matrix. The goal is to test if each pair of k matrices commute with each other or not with as few queries to the oracle as possible. In order to solve this problem, we use a theorem of Mario Szegedy (quant-ph/0401053) that relates a hitting time of a classical random walk to that of a quantum walk. We also take a look at another method of quantum walk by Andris Ambainis (quant-ph/0311001). We apply both walks into triangle finding problem (quant-ph/0310134) and matrix verification problem (quant-ph/0409035) to compare the powers of the two different walks. We also present Ambainis&#39;s method of lower bounding technique (quant-ph/0002066) to obtain a lower bound for this problem. It turns out Szegedy&#39;s algorithm can be generalized to solve similar problems. Therefore we use Szegedy&#39;s theorem to analyze the problem of matrix set commutativity. We give an O(k^{4/5}n^{9/5}) algorithm as well as a lower bound of Omega(k^{1/2}n). We generalize the technique used in coming up with the upper bound to solve a broader range of similar problems. This is probably the first problem to be studied on the quantum query complexity using quantum walks that involves more than one parameter, here, k and n.

<p><strong>17.    Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509208">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509208</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit by comparing two generalized master equations with memory. In the case of a thermal bath, we derive the solution of the post-Markovian master equation recently proposed in Ref. [A. Shabani and D.A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 71}, 020101(R) (2005)] and we study the dynamics for an exponentially decaying memory kernel. We compare the solution of the post-Markovian master equation with the solution of the typical memory kernel master equation. Our results lead to a new physical interpretation of the reservoir correlation function and bring to light the limits of usability of master equations with memory for the system under consideration.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509212">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509212</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unambiguous unitary maps and unambiguous unitary quantum channels are introduced and some of their properties are derived. These properties ensure certain simple form for the measurements involved in realizing an unambiguous unitary quantum channel. Error correction and unambiguous error correction with nonzero probability are discussed in terms of unambiguous unitary quantum channels. We not only re-derive the well-known condition for a set of errors to be correctable with certainty, but also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the errors caused by a noisy channel to be correctable with any nonzero probability. Dense coding with a partially entangled state can also be viewed as an unambiguous unitary quantum channel when all messages are required to be transmitted with equal probability of success, the maximal achievable probability of success is derived and the optimum protocol is also obtained.
