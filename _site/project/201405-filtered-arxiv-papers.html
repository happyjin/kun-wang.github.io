    <p><strong>1.    Quantum Non-Markovianity: Characterization, Quantification and Detection</strong><br>
?ngel Rivas, Susana F. Huelga, Martin B. Plenio<br>
Rep. Prog. Phys. 77, 094001 (2014)<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a comprehensive and up to date review on the concept of quantum non-Markovianity, a central theme in the theory of open quantum systems. We introduce the concept of quantum Markovian process as a generalization of the classical definition of Markovianity via the so-called divisibility property and relate this notion to the intuitive idea that links non-Markovianity with the persistence of memory effects. A detailed comparison with other definitions presented in the literature is provided. We then discuss several existing proposals to quantify the degree of non-Markovianity of quantum dynamics and to witness non-Markovian behavior, the latter providing sufficient conditions to detect deviations from strict Markovianity. Finally, we conclude by enumerating some timely open problems in the field and provide an outlook on possible research directions.

<p><strong>2.    Optimum topology of quasi-one dimensional nonlinear optical quantum systems</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We determine the optimum topology of quasi-one dimensional nonlinear optical structures using generalized quantum graph models. Quantum graphs are relational graphs endowed with a metric and a multiparticle Hamiltonian acting on the edges, and have a long application history in aromatic compounds, mesoscopic and artificial materials, and quantum chaos. Quantum graphs have recently emerged as models of quasi-one dimensional electron motion for simulating quantum-confined nonlinear optical systems. This paper derives the nonlinear optical properties of quantum graphs containing the basic star vertex and compares their responses across topological and geometrical classes. We show that such graphs have exactly the right topological properties to generate energy spectra required to achieve large, intrinsic optical nonlinearities. The graphs have the exquisite geometrical sensitivity required to tune wave function overlap in a way that optimizes the transition moments. We show that this class of graphs consistently produces intrinsic optical nonlinearities near the fundamental limits. We discuss the application of the models to the prediction and development of new nonlinear optical structures.

<p><strong>3.    Characterization of quantum dynamics using quantum error correction</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Characterizing noisy quantum processes is important to quantum computation and communication (QCC), since quantum systems are generally open. To date, all methods of characterization of quantum dynamics (CQD), typically implemented by quantum process tomography, are \textit{off-line}, i.e., QCC and CQD are not concurrent, as they require distinct state preparations. Here we introduce a method, &quot;quantum error correction based characterization of dynamics&quot;, in which the initial state is any element from the code space of a quantum error correcting code that can protect the state from arbitrary errors acting on the subsystem subjected to the unknown dynamics. The statistics of stabilizer measurements, with possible unitary pre-processing operations, are used to characterize the noise, while the observed syndrome can be used to correct the noisy state. Our method requires at most $2(4^n-1)$ configurations to characterize arbitrary noise acting on $n$ qubits.

<p><strong>4.    Scalable extraction of error models from the output of error detection circuits</strong><br>
Austin G. Fowler, D. Sank, J. Kelly, R. Barends, John M. Martinis<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1454">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1454</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Accurate methods of assessing the performance of quantum gates are extremely important. Quantum process tomography and randomized benchmarking are the current favored methods. Quantum process tomography gives detailed information, but significant approximations must be made to reduce this information to a form quantum error correction simulations can use. Randomized benchmarking typically outputs just a single number, the fidelity, giving no information on the structure of errors during the gate. Neither method is optimized to assess gate performance within an error detection circuit, where gates will be actually used in a large-scale quantum computer. Specifically, the important issues of error composition and error propagation lie outside the scope of both methods. We present a fast, simple, and scalable method of obtaining exactly the information required to perform effective quantum error correction from the output of continuously running error detection circuits, enabling accurate prediction of large-scale behavior.

<p><strong>5.    Fault-tolerance against loss for photonic FTQEC</strong><br>
Ben Fortescue, Sameer Nawaf, Mark Byrd<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1766">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1766</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In general, fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) procedures are designed to detect, correct, and be fault-tolerant against errors occurring within the qubit subspace. But in some qubit implementations, additional &quot;leakage&quot; errors can occur in which the system leaves this subspace, and standard FTQEC procedures may not be fault-tolerant against such errors. Generic methods for achieving fault-tolerance against leakage are costly in terms of resources. In this paper we demonstrate that for a leakage model common to many photonic gate implementations, FTQEC can be implemented with far fewer additional operations than in the generic case.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum Subsystems: Exploring the Complementarity of Quantum Privacy and Error Correction</strong><br>
Tomas Jochym-O&#39;Connor, David W. Kribs, Raymond Laflamme, Sarah Plosker<br>
Phys. Rev. A 90, 032305 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1798">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1798</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper addresses and expands on the contents of the recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 030502 (2013)] discussing private quantum subsystems. Here we prove several previously presented results, including a condition for a given random unitary channel to not have a private subspace (although this does not mean that private communication cannot occur, as was previously demonstrated via private subsystems) and algebraic conditions that characterize when a general quantum subsystem or subspace code is private for a quantum channel. These conditions can be regarded as the private analogue of the Knill-Laflamme conditions for quantum error correction, and we explore how the conditions simplify in some special cases. The bridge between quantum cryptography and quantum error correction provided by complementary quantum channels motivates the study of a new, more general definition of quantum error correcting code, and we initiate this study here. We also consider the concept of complementarity for the general notion of private quantum subsystem.

<p><strong>7.    Deterministic and Robust Generation of Single Photons On a Chip with 99.5% Indistinguishability Using Rapid Adiabatic Passage</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate deterministic and robust generation of pulsed resonance fluorescence single photons from a single InGaAs quantum dot using the method of rapid adiabatic passage. Comparative study is performed with transform-limited, negatively chirped and positively chirped pulses, identifying the last one to be the most robust against fluctuation of driving strength. The generated single photons are background free, have a vanishing two-photon emission probability of 0.3% and a raw (corrected) two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility of 97.9% (99.5%), reaching a precision that places single photons at the threshold for fault-tolerant surface-code quantum computing. The single-photon source can be readily scaled up to multi-photon entanglement and used for quantum metrology, boson sampling and linear optical quantum computing.

<p><strong>8.    On-chip interaction-free measurements via the quantum Zeno effect</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2068">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2068</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although interference is a classical-wave phenomenon, the superposition principle, which underlies interference of individual particles, is at the heart of quantum physics. An interaction-free measurements (IFM) harnesses the wave-particle duality of single photons to sense the presence of an object via the modification of the interference pattern, which can be accomplished even if the photon and the object haven&#39;t interacted with each other. By using the quantum Zeno effect, the efficiency of an IFM can be made arbitrarily close to unity. Here we report an on-chip realization of the IFM based on silicon photonics. We exploit the inherent advantages of the lithographically written waveguides: excellent interferometric phase stability and mode matching, and obtain multipath interference with visibility above 98%. We achieved a normalized IFM efficiency up to 68.2%, which exceeds the 50% limit of the original IFM proposal.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2355">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2355</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A local, deterministic, and realistic model within a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime with constant spatial curvature is presented which describes simultaneous measurements of the spins of two fermions emerging in a singlet state from the decay of a spinless boson. Exact agreement with the probabilistic predictions of quantum theory is achieved in the model without data rejection, remote contextuality, superdeterminism, or backward causation. An event-by-event numerical simulation of the model is presented, which confirms our analytical results with the accuracy of 4 in ${10^4}$ parts.

<p><strong>10.    Preserving Information from the Beginning to the End of time in a Robertson-Walker Spacetime</strong><br>
Stefano Mancini, Roberto Pierini, Mark M. Wilde<br>
New Journal of Physics, vol. 16, page 123049, December 2014<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2510">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2510</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Preserving information stored in a physical system subjected to noise can be modeled in a communication-theoretic paradigm, in which storage and retrieval correspond to an input encoding and output decoding, respectively. The encoding and decoding are then constructed in such a way as to protect against the action of a given noisy quantum channel. This paper considers the situation in which the noise is not due to technological imperfections, but rather to the physical laws governing the evolution of the universe. In particular, we consider the dynamics of quantum systems under a 1+1 Robertson-Walker spacetime and find that the noise imparted to them is equivalent to the well known amplitude damping channel. Since one might be interested in preserving both classical and quantum information in such a scenario, we study trade-off coding strategies and determine a region of achievable rates for the preservation of both kinds of information. For applications beyond the physical setting studied here, we also determine a trade-off between achievable rates of classical and quantum information preservation when entanglement assistance is available.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a practical method for active phase control on a photonic chip that has immediate applications in quantum photonics. Our approach uses strain-optic modification of the refractive index of individual waveguides, effected by a millimeter-scale mechanical actuator. The resulting phase change of propagating optical fields is rapid and polarization-dependent, enabling quantum applications that require active control and polarization encoding. We demonstrate strain-optic control of non-classical states of light in silica, showing the generation of 2-photon polarisation N00N states by manipulating Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We also demonstrate switching times of a few microseconds, which are sufficient for silica-based feed-forward control of photonic quantum states.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3325">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3325</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show how to generate and control the correlations in a set of two distant quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional dissipative plasmonic waveguide. An external laser field enhances the dimer&#39;s steady-state correlations and allows an active control (switching on/off) of nonclassical correlations. The plasmon-assisted dipolar-interacting qubits exhibit persistent correlations, which in turn can be decoupled and made to evolve independently from each other. The setup enables long-distance ($\sim 1\, \mu$m) qubit control that works for both resonant and detuned emitters. For suitable emitter initialization, we also show that the quantum correlation is always greater than the classical one.

<p>
In this paper we develop a method for investigating semi-device-independent randomness expansion protocols that was introduced in [Li et al., Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{87}$, 020302(R) (2013)]. This method allows to lower-bound, with semi-definite programming, the randomness obtained from random number generators based on dimension witnesses. We also investigate the robustness of some randomness expanders using this method. We show the role of an assumption about the trace of the measurement operators and a way to avoid it. The method is also generalized to systems of arbitrary dimension, and for a more general form of dimension witnesses, than it the previous paper. Finally, we introduce a procedure of dimension witness reduction, which can be used to obtain from an existing witness a new one with higher amount of certifiable randomness. The presented methods finds an application for experiments [Ahrens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{112}$, 140401 (2014)].

<p><strong>14.    Robust Quantum Metrological Schemes</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4052">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4052</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fragile quantum features such as entanglement are employed to improve the precision of parameter estimation and therefore the quantum gain is vulnerable to noises. As an established tool to subdue noises, quantum error correction is unfortunately overprotective because the quantum enhancement can still be achieved even if the states are unrecoverably affected, provided that the quantum Fisher information, which sets the ultimate limit to the precision of metrological schemes, is preserved and attained. Here, we shall develop a novel theory of robust metrological schemes that preserve the quantum Fisher information instead of the quantum states themselves against noises. After deriving a minimal set of testable conditions on this kind of robustness, we construct a family of $2t+1$ qubits metrological schemes that are immune to $t$-qubit errors. In comparison at least five qubits are required for correcting arbitrary 1-qubit errors in standard quantum error correction.

It has been shown in recent years that quantum information has a topological nature (\cite{AC}, \cite{Co}, \cite{Co2}). In \cite{V}, Vicary undergoes the study of quantum algorithms using this new topological approach. The advantage of this new formalism is that it allows new proofs of correctness of the algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa, hidden subgroup and single-shot Grover algorithms. It also provide more clear insight to the generalizations of these algorithms. In this paper, we consider (multi-step) Grover algorithm from this new perspective.

This paper introduces a new notion of quantum recursion of which the control flow of the computation is quantum rather than classical as in the notions of recursion considered in the previous studies of quantum programming.

The operational and denotational semantics of quantum recursions are defined by employing the second quantisation method, and they are proved to be equivalent.

We consider population transfer in open quantum systems, which are described by quantum dynamical semigroups (QDS). Using second order perturbation theory of the Lindblad equation, we show that it depends on a weak external field only through the field&#39;s autocorrelation function (ACF), which is phase independent. Therefore, for leading order in perturbation, QDS cannot support dependence of the population transfer on the phase properties of weak fields. We examine an example of weak-field phase-dependent population transfer, and show that the phase-dependence comes from the next order in the perturbation.

<blockquote>
<p>
We describe two implementations of the optimal error correction algorithm known as the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) for the 2D surface code with a noiseless syndrome extraction. First, we show how to implement MLD exactly in time $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of code qubits. Our implementation uses a reduction from MLD to simulation of matchgate quantum circuits. This reduction however requires a special noise model with independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. Secondly, we show how to implement MLD approximately for more general noise models using matrix product states (MPS). Our implementation has running time $O(n\chi^3)$ where $\chi$ is a parameter that controls the approximation precision. The key step of our algorithm, borrowed from the DMRG method, is a subroutine for contracting a tensor network on the two-dimensional grid. The subroutine uses MPS with a bond dimension $\chi$ to approximate the sequence of tensors arising in the course of contraction. We benchmark the MPS-based decoder against the standard minimum weight matching decoder observing a significant reduction of the logical error probability for $\chi\ge 4$.

<p>
The accelerated development of quantum technology has reached a pivotal point. Early in 2014, several results were published demonstrating that several experimental technologies are now accurate enough to satisfy the requirements of fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. While there are many technological and experimental issues that still need to be solved, the ability of experimental systems to now have error rates low enough to satisfy the fault-tolerant threshold for several error correction models is a tremendous milestone. Consequently, it is now a good time for the computer science and classical engineering community to examine the {\em classical} problems associated with compiling quantum algorithms and implementing them on future quantum hardware. In this paper, we will review the basic operational rules of a topological quantum computing architecture and outline one of the most important classical problems that need to be solved; the decoding of error correction data for a large-scale quantum computer. We will endeavour to present these problems independently from the underlying physics as much of this work can be effectively solved by non-experts in quantum information or quantum mechanics.

We model quantum transport, described by continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), on deterministic Sierpinski fractals, differentiating between Sierpinski gaskets and Sierpinski carpets, along with their dual structures. The transport efficiencies are defined in terms of the exact and the average return probabilities, as well as by the mean survival probability when absorbing traps are present. In the case of gaskets, localization can be identified already for small networks (generations). For carpets, our numerical results indicate a trend towards localization, but only for relatively large structures. The comparison of gaskets and carpets further implies that, distinct from the corresponding classical continuous-time random walk, the spectral dimension does not fully determine the evolution of the CTQW.

<blockquote>
<p>
In this article we use the method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to design a photonic lattice (array of waveguides) which can drive the input light to a controlled location at the output. The output position in the array is determined by functions of the propagation distance along the waveguides, which modulate the lattice characteristics (index of refraction, first and second neighbor couplings). The proposed coupler is expected to posses the robustness properties of the design method, coming from its adiabatic nature, and also to have a smaller footprint than purely adiabatic couplers. The present work provides a very interesting example where methods from quantum control can be exploited to design lattices with desired input-output properties.

<blockquote>
<p>
The time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-field (TD-RASSCF) method is formulated based on the TD variational principle. In analogy with the configuration-interaction singles (CIS), singles-and-doubles (CISD), singles-doubles-and-triples (CISDT) methods in quantum chemistry, the TD-RASSCF-S, -SD, and -SDT methods are introduced as extensions of the TD-RASSCF dou- bles (-D) method [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062511 (2013)]. Based on an analysis of the numerical cost and test calculations for one-dimensional (1D) models of atomic helium, beryllium, and carbon, it is shown that the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods are computationally feasible for systems with many electrons and more accurate than the TD Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and TDCIS methods. In addition to the discussion of methodology, an analysis of electron dynamics in the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process is presented. For the 1D beryllium atom, a state-resolved analysis of the HHG spectrum based on the time-independent HF orbitals shows that while only single-orbital excitations are needed in the region below the cutoff, single- and double-orbital excitations are es- sential beyond, where accordingly the single-active-electron (SAE) approximation and the TDCIS method break down. On the other hand, the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods accurately describe the multi-orbital excitation processes throughout the entire region of the HHG spectrum. For the 1D carbon atom, our calculations show that multi-orbital excitations are essential in the HHG process even below the cutoff. Hence, in this test system a very accurate treatment of electron correlation is required. The TD-RASSCF-S and -D approaches meet this demand, while the SAE approximation and the TDCIS method are inadequate.

By driving a dispersively coupled qubit-resonator system, we realize an &quot;impedance-matched&quot; $\Lambda$ system that has two identical radiative decay rates from the top level and interacts with a semi-infinite waveguide. It has been predicted that a photon input from the waveguide deterministically induces a Raman transition in the system and switches its electronic state. We confirm this through microwave response to a continuous probe field, observing near-perfect ($99.7\%$) extinction of the reflection and highly efficient ($74\%$) frequency down-conversion. These proof-of-principle results lead to deterministic quantum gates between material qubits and microwave photons and open the possibility for scalable quantum networks interconnected with waveguide photons.

Syndrome measurements made in quantum error correction contain more information than is typically used. We show that the statistics of data from syndrome measurements can be used to do the following: (i) estimation of parameters of an error channel, including the ability correct away the invertible part of the error channel, once it is estimated; (ii) hypothesis testing (or model selection) to distinguish error channels, e.g., to determine if the errors are correlated. The unifying theme is to make use of all of the information in the statistics of the data collected from syndrome measurements using machine learning and control algorithms.

Wigner separated the possible types of symmetries in quantum theory into those symmetries that are unitary and those that are antiunitary. Unitary symmetries have been well studied whereas antiunitary symmetries and the physical implications associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking have had little influence on quantum information science. Here we develop a quantum circuits version of time-reversal symmetry theory, classifying time-symmetric and time-asymmetric Hamiltonians and circuits in terms of their underlying network elements and geometric structures. These results reveal that many of the typical quantum circuit networks found across the field of quantum information science exhibit time-asymmetry. We then experimentally implement the most fundamental time-reversal asymmetric process, applying local gates in an otherwise time-symmetric circuit to induce time-reversal asymmetry and thereby achieve (i) directional biasing in the transition probability between basis states, (ii) the enhancement of and (iii) the suppression of these transport probabilities. Our results imply that the physical effect of time-symmetry breaking plays an essential role in coherent transport and its control represents an omnipresent yet essentially untapped resource in quantum transport science.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a nonintrusive method for reliably estimating the noise level during quantum computation and quantum communication protected by quantum error-correcting codes. As preprocessing of quantum error correction, our scheme estimates the current noise level through a negligible amount of classical computation using error syndromes and updates the decoder&#39;s knowledge on the spot before inferring the locations of errors. This preprocessing requires no additional quantum interaction or modification in the system. The estimate can be of higher quality than the maximum likelihood estimate based on perfect knowledge of channel parameters, thereby eliminating the need of the unrealistic assumption that the decoder accurately knows channel parameters a priori. Simulations demonstrate that not only can the decoder pick up on a change of channel parameters, but even if the channel stays the same, a quantum low-density parity-check code can perform better when the decoder exploits the on-the-spot estimates instead of the true error probabilities of the quantum channel.

<blockquote>
<p>
We present a source of polarization-entangled photon pairs suitable for the implementation of long-distance quantum communication protocols using quantum memories. Photon pairs with wavelengths 883 nm and 1338 nm are produced by coherently pumping two periodically poled nonlinear waveguides embedded in the arms of a polarization interferometer. Subsequent spectral filtering reduces the bandwidth of the photons to 240 MHz. The bandwidth is well-matched to a quantum memory based on an Nd:YSO crystal, to which, in addition, the center frequency of the 883 nm photons is actively stabilized. A theoretical model that includes the effect of the filtering is presented and accurately fits the measured correlation functions of the generated photons. The model can also be used as a way to properly assess the properties of the source. The quality of the entanglement is revealed by a visibility of V = 96.1(9)% in a Bell-type experiment and through the violation of a Bell inequality.

The control of quantum walk is made particularly transparent when the initial state is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the coin operator.

<p>
We investigate the exact entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, interacting with an anisotropic spin bath in thermal equi- librium at a temperature T, driven by an external magnetic field B along the z-axis. We establish that, for an initially entangled qubit pair, the DM interactions generate entanglement and enhance the entanglement in the revival region. The effects of the DM interaction are also seen to be very important at high temperatures and for weak coupling between the two qubits where it is seen to preserve entanglement. These effects are weakened when the magnetic field B and the Heisenberg coupling are switched on. If the two-qubits are prepared in an initially separable state, the DM in- teraction instead has a negative effect on their entanglement. On a whole entanglement can better be preserve in the spin chain even at high temperatures by increases the external magnetic field B and the Heisenberg couplings, and by tuning the strength of the DM interaction.

<p>
We analyze two families of three-state quantum walks which show the localization effect. We focus on the role of the initial coin state and its coherence in controlling the properties of the quantum walk. In particular, we show that the description of the walk simplifies considerably when the initial coin state is decomposed in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator. This allows us to express the limit distributions in a much more convenient form. Consequently, striking features which are hidden in the standard basis description are easily identified. Moreover, the dependence of moments of the position distribution on the initial coin state can be analyzed in full detail. In particular, we find that in the eigenvector basis the even moments and the localization probability at the origin depend only on incoherent combination of probabilities. In contrast, odd moments and localization outside the origin are affected by the coherence of the initial coin state.

Recurrence in the classical random walk is well known and described by the P\&#39;olya number. For quantum walks, recurrence is similarly understood in terms of the probability of a localized quantum walker to return to its origin. Under certain circumstances the quantum walker may also return to an arbitrary initial quantum state in a finite number of steps. Quantum state revivals in quantum walks on circles using coin operators which are constant in time and uniform across the path have been described before but only incompletely.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a non-Hermitian generalization of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), which allows one to increase speed and fidelity of the adiabatic passage. This is done by adding balanced imaginary (gain/loss) terms in the diagonal (bare energy) terms of the Hamiltonian and choosing them such that they cancel exactly the nonadiabatic couplings, providing in this way an effective shortcut to adiabaticity. Remarkably, for a STIRAP using delayed Gaussian-shaped pulses in the counter-intuitive scheme the imaginary terms of the Hamiltonian turn out to be time independent. A possible physical realization of non-Hermitian STIRAP, based on light transfer in three evanescently-coupled optical waveguides, is proposed.

<blockquote>
<p>
Stochastic languages are the languages recognized by probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) with cutpoint over the field of real numbers. More general computational models over the same field such as generalized finite automata (GFAs) and quantum finite automata (QFAs) define the same class. In 1963, Rabin proved the set of stochastic languages to be uncountable presenting a single 2-state PFA over the binary alphabet recognizing uncountably many languages depending on the cutpoint. In this paper, we show the same result for unary stochastic languages. Namely, we exhibit a 2-state unary GFA, a 2-state unary QFA, and a family of 3-state unary PFAs recognizing uncountably many languages; all these numbers of states are optimal. After this, we completely characterize the class of languages recognized by 1-state GFAs, which is the only nontrivial class of languages recognized by 1-state automata. Finally, we consider the variations of PFAs, QFAs, and GFAs based on the notion of inclusive/exclusive cutpoint, and present some results on their expressive power.

<p>
Unwanted interaction between a quantum system and its fluctuating environment leads to decoherence and is the primary obstacle to establishing a scalable quantum information processing architecture. Strategies such as environmental and materials engineering, quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling can mitigate decoherence, but generally increase experimental complexity. Here we improve coherence in a qubit using real-time Hamiltonian parameter estimation. Using a rapidly converging Bayesian approach, we precisely measure the splitting in a singlet-triplet spin qubit faster than the surrounding nuclear bath fluctuates. We continuously adjust qubit control parameters based on this information, thereby improving the inhomogenously broadened coherence time ($T_{2}^{*}$) from tens of nanoseconds to above 2 $\mu$s and demonstrating the effectiveness of Hamiltonian estimation in reducing the effects of correlated noise in quantum systems. Because the technique demonstrated here is compatible with arbitrary qubit operations, it is a natural complement to quantum error correction and can be used to improve the performance of a wide variety of qubits in both metrological and quantum-information-processing applications.

Quantum Random Walks (QRW) were first defined as one-particle sectors of Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA). Recently, they have been generalized to include history dependence, either on previous coin (internal, i.e., spin or velocity) states or on previous position states. These models have the goal of studying the transition to classicality, or more generally, changes in the performance of quantum walks in algorithmic applications. We show that several history dependent QRW can be identified as one-particle sectors of QLGA. This provides a unifying conceptual framework for these models in which the extra degrees of freedom required to store the history information arise naturally as geometrical degrees of freedom on the lattice.

We attempt to extract a homological structure of two kinds of graphs by the Grover walk. The first one consists of a cycle and two semi-infinite lines and the second one is assembled by a periodic embedding of the cycles in $\mathbb{Z}$. We show that both of them have essentially the same eigenvalues induced by the existence of cycles in the infinite graphs. The eigenspace of the homological structure appears as so called {\it localization} in the Grover walks, in that the walk is partially trapped by the homological structure. On the other hand, the difference of the absolutely continuous part of spectrum between them provides different behaviors. We characterize the behaviors by the density functions in the weak convergence theorem: the first one is the delta measure at the bottom while the second one is expressed by two kinds of continuous functions which have different finite supports $(-1/\sqrt{10},1/\sqrt{10})$ and $(-2/7,2/7)$, respectively.

<p>
We present an analysis of the relaxation dynamics of finite-size topological qubits in contact with a thermal bath. Using a continuous-time Monte Carlo method, we explicitly compute the low-temperature nonequilibrium dynamics of the toric code on finite lattices. In contrast to the size-independent bound predicted for the toric code in the thermodynamic limit, we identify a low-temperature regime on finite lattices below a size-dependent crossover temperature with nontrivial finite-size and temperature scaling of the relaxation time. We demonstrate how this nontrivial finite-size scaling is governed by the scaling of topologically nontrivial two-dimensional classical random walks. The transition out of this low-temperature regime defines a dynamical finite-size crossover temperature that scales inversely with the log of the system size, in agreement with a crossover temperature defined from equilibrium properties. We find that both the finite-size and finite-temperature scaling are stronger in the low-temperature regime than above the crossover temperature. Since this finite-temperature scaling competes with the scaling of the robustness to unitary perturbations, this analysis may elucidate the scaling of memory lifetimes of possible physical realizations of topological qubits.

High-order coherence effects between two first-order incoherent sources with fully independent phases have been well studied in the literature, which shows interference fringes with respect to the position separations among different space points. Here we show that this is not the whole story, and find that the high-order coherence effects depend on the mode of the phase random walk of the first-order incoherent sources, which can be controlled artificially and represented geometrically by vectorial polygons. Interestingly, by scanning the detectors along the same direction with the position separations between them kept constant, a set of high-order coherence fringes, which fingerprint the phase random walk of the first-order incoherent sources, can be observed. Our results show that it is possible to control the high-order coherence of two first-order incoherent sources, which could have important practical applications such as superhigh resolution optical lithography.

In both quantum mechanics and corpus linguistics based on vector spaces, the notion of entanglement provides a means for the various subsystems to communicate with each other. In this paper we examine a number of implementations of the categorical framework of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark (2010) for natural language, from an entanglement perspective. Specifically, our goal is to better understand in what way the level of entanglement of the relational tensors (or the lack of it) affects the compositional structures in practical situations. Our findings reveal that a number of proposals for verb construction lead to almost separable tensors, a fact that considerably simplifies the interactions between the words. We examine the ramifications of this fact, and we show that the use of Frobenius algebras mitigates the potential problems to a great extent. Finally, we briefly examine a machine learning method that creates verb tensors exhibiting a sufficient level of entanglement.

Over the years, supersymmetric quantum mechanics has evolved from a toy model of high energy physics to a field of its own. Although various examples of supersymmetric quantum mechanics have been found, systems that have a natural realization are scarce. Here, we show that the extension of the conventional Cooper-pair box by a 4pi-periodic Majorana-Josephson coupling realizes supersymmetry for certain values of the ratio between the conventional Josephson and the Majorana- Josephson coupling strength. The supersymmetry we find is a &quot;hidden&quot; minimally bosonized supersymmetry that provides a non-trivial generalization of the supersymmetry of the free particle and relies crucially on the presence of an anomalous Josephson junction in the system. We show that the resulting degeneracy of the energy levels can be probed directly in a tunneling experiment and discuss the various transport signatures. An observation of the predicted level degeneracy would provide clear evidence for the presence of the anomalous Josephson coupling.

This formulation naturally unifies symplectic geometry of Hamiltonian dynamics, complex geometry of quantum theory and real geometry of general relativity.

The time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-field singles (TD-RASSCF-S) method is presented for investigating TD many-electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. Adopting the SCF notion from the muticonfigurational TD Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) method and the RAS scheme (single-orbital excitation concept) from the TD configuration-interaction singles (TDCIS) method, the TD-RASSCF-S method can be regarded as a hybrid of them. We prove that, for closed-shell $N_{\rm e}$-electron systems, the TD-RASSCF-S wave function can be fully converged using only $N_{\rm e}/2+1\le M\le N_{\rm e}$ spatial orbitals. Importantly, based on the TD variational principle, the converged TD-RASSCF-S wave function with $M= N_{\rm e}$ is more accurate than the TDCIS wave function. The accuracy of the TD-RASSCF-S approach over the TDCIS is illustrated by the calculation of high-order harmonic generation spectra for one-dimensional models of atomic helium, beryllium, and carbon in an intense laser pulse. The electronic dynamics during the process is investigated by analyzing the behavior of electron density and orbitals. The TD-RASSCF-S method is accurate, numerically tractable, and applicable for large systems beyond the capability of the MCTDHF method.

We propose and analyze a generalization of the Kitaev chain for fermions with long-range $p$-wave pairing, which decays with distance as a power-law with exponent $\alpha$. Using the integrability of the model, we demonstrate the existence of two types of gapped regimes, where correlation functions decay exponentially at short range and algebraically at long range ($\alpha &gt; 1$) or purely algebraically ($\alpha &lt; 1$). Most interestingly, along the critical lines, long-range pairing is found to break conformal symmetry for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This is accompanied by a violation of the area law for the entanglement entropy in large parts of the phase diagram in the presence of a gap, and can be detected via the dynamics of entanglement following a quench. Some of these features may be relevant for current experiments with cold atomic ions.
