    <p><strong>1.    Dissipative decoherence in the Grover algorithm</strong><br>
O. V. Zhirov, D. L. Shepelyansky<br>
Eur. Phys. J. D 38, 405 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511010">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511010</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Using the methods of quantum trajectories we study effects of dissipative decoherence on the accuracy of the Grover quantum search algorithm. The dependence on the number of qubits and dissipation rate are determined and tested numerically with up to 16 qubits. As a result, our numerical and analytical studies give the universal law for decay of fidelity and probability of searched state which are induced by dissipative decoherence effects. This law is in agreement with the results obtained previously for quantum chaos algorithms.

<p><strong>2.    Bounded-Error Quantum State Identification and Exponential Separations in Communication Complexity</strong><br>
Dmitry Gavinsky, Julia Kempe, Oded Regev, Ronald de Wolf<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511013">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511013</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of bounded-error quantum state identification: given either state \alpha_0 or state \alpha_1, we are required to output <code>0&#39;,</code>1&#39; or <code>?&#39; (&quot;don&#39;t know&quot;), such that conditioned on outputting</code>0&#39; or <code>1&#39;, our guess is correct with high probability. The goal is to maximize the probability of not outputting</code>?&#39;. We prove a direct product theorem: if we&#39;re given two such problems, with optimal probabilities a and b, respectively, and the states in the first problem are pure, then the optimal probability for the joint bounded-error state identification problem is O(ab). Our proof is based on semidefinite programming duality and may be of wider interest. Using this result, we present two exponential separations in the simultaneous message passing model of communication complexity. Both are shown in the strongest possible sense. First, we describe a relation that can be computed with O(log n) classical bits of communication in the presence of shared randomness, but needs Omega(n^{1/3}) communication if the parties don&#39;t share randomness, even if communication is quantum. This shows the optimality of Yao&#39;s recent exponential simulation of shared-randomness protocols by quantum protocols without shared randomness. Second, we describe a relation that can be computed with O(log n) classical bits of communication in the presence of shared entanglement, but needs Omega((n/log n)^{1/3}) communication if the parties share randomness but no entanglement, even if communication is quantum. This is the first example in communication complexity of a situation where entanglement buys you much more than quantum communication does.

<p><strong>3.    Controllable Entanglement of Lights in a Five-Level System</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511027">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511027</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze the nonlinear optical response of a five-level system under a novel configuration of electro-magnetically induced transparency. We show that a giant Kerr nonlinearity with a relatively large cross-phase modulation coefficient that occurs in such system may be used to produce an efficient photon-photon entanglement. We demonstrate that such photon-photon entanglement is practically controllable and hence facilitates promising applications in quantum information and computation.

<p><strong>4.    Strong Fourier Sampling Fails over $G^n$</strong><br>
Gorjan Alagic, Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511054">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511054</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a negative result regarding the hidden subgroup problem on the powers $G^n$ of a fixed group $G$. Under a condition on the base group $G$, we prove that strong Fourier sampling cannot distinguish some subgroups of $G^n$. Since strong sampling is in fact the optimal measurement on a coset state, this shows that we have no hope of efficiently solving the hidden subgroup problem over these groups with separable measurements on coset states (that is, using any polynomial number of single-register coset state experiments). Base groups satisfying our condition include all nonabelian simple groups. We apply our results to show that there exist uniform families of nilpotent groups whose normal series factors have constant size and yet are immune to strong Fourier sampling.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum error correction via robust probe modes</strong><br>
Fumiko Yamaguchi, Kae Nemoto, William J. Munro<br>
Phys. Rev. A 73, 060302R (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511098">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511098</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new scheme for quantum error correction using robust continuous variable probe modes, rather than fragile ancilla qubits, to detect errors without destroying data qubits. The use of such probe modes reduces the required number of expensive qubits in error correction and allows efficient encoding, error detection and error correction. Moreover, the elimination of the need for direct qubit interactions significantly simplifies the construction of quantum circuits. We will illustrate how the approach implements three existing quantum error correcting codes: the 3-qubit bit-flip (phase-flip) code, the Shor code, and an erasure code.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum Error Correcting Codes From The Compression Formalism</strong><br>
Man-Duen Choi, David W. Kribs, Karol Zyczkowski<br>
Rep. Math. Phys., 58 (2006), 77-91.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511101">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511101</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We solve the fundamental quantum error correction problem for bi-unitary channels on two-qubit Hilbert space. By solving an algebraic compression problem, we construct qubit codes for such channels on arbitrary dimension Hilbert space, and identify correctable codes for Pauli-error models not obtained by the stabilizer formalism. This is accomplished through an application of a new tool for error correction in quantum computing called the ``higher-rank numerical range&#39;&#39;. We describe its basic properties and discuss possible further applications.

<p><strong>7.    Entanglement, fidelity, and quantum-classical correlations with an atom walking in a quantized cavity field</strong><br>
S.V. Prants, M.Yu. Uleysky, V.Yu. Argonov<br>
S.V. Prants, M.Yu. Uleysky, and V.Yu. Argonov. Entanglement, fidelity, and quantum-classical correlations with an atom moving in a quantized cavity field. Physical Review A. V.73 (2006) art. 023807.<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511106">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511106</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Stability and instability of quantum evolution are studied in the interaction between a two-level atom with photon recoil and a quantized field mode in an ideal cavity, the basic model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). It is shown that the Jaynes-Cummings dynamics can be unstable in the regime of chaotic walking of the atomic center-of-mass in the quantized field of a standing wave in the absence of any kind of interaction with environment. This kind of quantum instability manifests itself in strong variations of reduced quantum purity and entropy, correlating with the respective classical Lyapunov exponent, and in exponential sensitivity of fidelity of quantum states to small variations in the atom-field detuning. The connection between quantum entanglement and fidelity and the center-of-mass motion is clarified analytically and numerically for a few regimes of that motion. The results are illustrated with two specific initial field states: the Fock and coherent ones. Numerical experiments demonstrate various manifestations of the quantum-classical correspondence, including dynamical chaos and fractals, which can be, in principle, observed in real experiments with atoms and photons in high finesse cavities.

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an approach suitable for solving NP-complete problems via adiabatic quantum computation with an architecture based on a lattice of interacting spins (qubits) driven by locally adjustable effective magnetic fields. Interactions between qubits are assumed constant and instance-independent, programming is done only by changing local magnetic fields. Implementations using qubits coupled by magnetic-, electric-dipole and exchange interactions are discussed.

We report on a direct experimental observation of dynamic localization (DL) of light in sinusoidally-curved Lithium-Niobate waveguide arrays which provides the optical analog of DL for electrons in periodic potentials subjected to ac electric fields as originally proposed by Dunlap and Kenkre [D.H.

<p><strong>10.    Hall of Mirrors Scattering from an Impurity in a Quantum Wire</strong><br>
J. Y. Vaishnav, A. Itsara, E. J. Heller<br>
Phys. Rev. B 73, 115331 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511137">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511137</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper develops a scattering theory to examine how point impurities affect transport through quantum wires. While some of our new results apply specifically to hard-walled wires, others--for example, an effective optical theorem for two-dimensional waveguides--are more general. We apply the method of images to the hard-walled guide, explicitly showing how scattering from an impurity affects the wire&#39;s conductance. We express the effective cross section of a confined scatterer entirely in terms of the empty waveguide&#39;s Green&#39;s function, suggesting a way in which to use semiclassical methods to understand transport properties of smooth wires. In addition to predicting some new phenomena, our approach provides a simple physical picture for previously observed effects such as conductance dips and confinement-induced resonances.

We present the quantum programming language cQPL which is an extended version of QPL [P. Selinger, Math. Struct. in Comp. Sci. 14(4):527-586, 2004]. It is capable of quantum communication and it can be used to formulate all possible quantum algorithms. Additionally, it possesses a denotational semantics based on a partial order of superoperators and uses fixed points on a generalised Hilbert space to formalise (in addition to all standard features expected from a quantum programming language) the exchange of classical and quantum data between an arbitrary number of participants. Additionally, we present the implementation of a cQPL compiler which generates code for a quantum simulator.

<p><strong>12.    Tight Results on Multiregister Fourier Sampling: Quantum Measurements for Graph Isomorphism Require Entanglement</strong><br>
Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511149">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511149</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We establish a general method for proving bounds on the information that can be extracted via arbitrary entangled measurements on tensor products of hidden subgroup coset states. When applied to the symmetric group, the method yields an Omega(n log n) lower bound on the number of coset states over which we must perform an entangled measurement in order to obtain non-negligible information about a hidden involution. These results are tight to within a multiplicative constant and apply, in particular, to the case relevant for the Graph Isomorphism problem. Part of our proof was obtained after learning from Hallgren, Roetteler, and Sen that they had obtained similar results.

<p><strong>13.    Non-Markovian decay beyond the Fermi Golden Rule: Survival Collapse of the polarization in spin chains</strong><br>
E. Rufeil Fiori, H. M. Pastawski<br>
Chem. Phys. Lett., 420, 35-41 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511176">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511176</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The decay of a local spin excitation in an inhomogeneous spin chain is evaluated exactly: I) It starts quadratically up to a spreading time t_{S}. II) It follows an exponential behavior governed by a self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule. III) At longer times, the exponential is overrun by an inverse power law describing return processes governed by quantum diffusion. At this last transition time t_{R} a survival collapse becomes possible, bringing the polarization down by several orders of magnitude. We identify this strongly destructive interference as an antiresonance in the time domain. These general phenomena are suitable for observation through an NMR experiment.

<p><strong>14.    Projection Measurement of the Maximally Entangled N-Photon State for a Demonstration of N-Photon de Broglie Wavelength</strong><br>
F. W. Sun, Z. Y. Ou, G. C. Guo<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511189">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511189</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a projection measurement process for the maximally entangled N-photon state (the NOON-state) with only linear optical elements and photodetectors. This measurement process will give null result for any N-photon state that is orthogonal to the NOON state. We examine the projection process in more detail for N=4 by applying it to a four-photon state from type-II parametric down-conversion. This demonstrates an orthogonal projection measurement with a null result. This null result corresponds to a dip in a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer for four photons. We find that the depth of the dip in this arrangement can be used to distinguish a genuine entangled four-photon state from two separate pairs of photons. We next apply the NOON state projection measurement to a four-photon superposition state from two perpendicularly oriented type-I parametric down-conversion processes. A successful NOON state projection is demonstrated with the appearance of the four-photon de Broglie wavelength in the interference fringe pattern.

An analogy is explored between a setup of three atomic traps coupled via tunneling and an internal atomic three-level system interacting with two laser fields. Within this scenario we describe a STIRAP like process which allows to move an atom between the ground states of two trapping potentials and analyze its robustness. This analogy is extended to other robust and coherent transport schemes and to systems of more than a single atom. Finally it is applied to manipulate external degrees of freedom of atomic wave packets propagating in waveguides.

<p><strong>16.    A New Quantum Lower Bound Method, with Applications to Direct Product Theorems and Time-Space Tradeoffs</strong><br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511200">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511200</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give a new version of the adversary method for proving lower bounds on quantum query algorithms. The new method is based on analyzing the eigenspace structure of the problem at hand. We use it to prove a new and optimal strong direct product theorem for 2-sided error quantum algorithms computing k independent instances of a symmetric Boolean function: if the algorithm uses significantly less than k times the number of queries needed for one instance of the function, then its success probability is exponentially small in k. We also use the polynomial method to prove a direct product theorem for 1-sided error algorithms for k threshold functions with a stronger bound on the success probability. Finally, we present a quantum algorithm for evaluating solutions to systems of linear inequalities, and use our direct product theorems to show that the time-space tradeoff of this algorithm is close to optimal.

<p><strong>17.    Transfer of single photon polarization states by two-channel continuous variable teleportation</strong><br>
Toshiki Ide, Holger F. Hofmann<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511220">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511220</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Superpositions of two orthogonal single-photon polarization states are commonly used as optical qubits. If such qubits are sent by continuous variable quantum teleportation, the modifications of the qubit states due to imperfect entanglement cause an increase in the average photon number of the output state. This effect can be interpreted as an accidental quantum cloning of the single photon input. We analyze the output statistics of the single photon teleportation and derive the transfer and cloning fidelities from the equations of the polarization qubit.

We show that a tight upper bound on the stochastic decay of encoded fidelity can be computed from the measurement records. Our results provide an informative case study in decoherence suppression with finite-strength measurement.

<p><strong>19.    Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion: Application to Quantum Jumps in $^{24}$Mg$^+$</strong><br>
Joshua Wilkie, Ray Ng<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511236">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511236</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) is an exact method for calculating the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary subsystem interacting linearly with the radiation field. Applications of the theory have however been few due to the intractable nature of the variational-differential NMQSD evolution equation. Recently, we argued that the variational-differential equation can be rewritten as an integrodifferential equation which can be readily solved numerically. This manuscript provides an explicit derivation of the modified equations. Applications to intermittent fluorescence in $^{24}$Mg$^+$ are discussed in detail. Earlier speculations that quantum jumps occur on all time scales are verified on a picosecond timescale. We show that a plot of the probability density of the signal vs signal strength shows the two characteristic peaks associated with the bright and dark manifolds, and that the ratio of the areas under the peaks is 16 as observed experimentally. We also show that the shape of this distribution is sensitive to bath memory, but has a mathematical form common to both the Markovian and non-Markovian cases.

We consider translationally invariant states of an infinite one dimensional chain of qubits or spin-1/2 particles. We maximize the entanglement shared by nearest neighbours via a variational approach based on finitely correlated states. We find an upper bound of nearest neighbour concurrence equal to C=0.434095 which is 0.09% away from the bound C_W=0.434467 obtained by a completely different procedure. The obtained state maximizing nearest neighbour entanglement seems to approximate the maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). Further we investigate in detail several other properties of the so obtained optimal state.

In this article, we show that in the level of quantum mechanics, a photon position operator with commuting components can be obtained in a more natural way; in the level of quantum field theory, the photon position operator corresponds to the center of the photon number. It is most interesting for us to show that, a photon inside a waveguide can be localized in the same sense that a massive particle can be localized in free space, and just as that it is impossible to localize a massive particle with a greater precision than its Compton wavelength, one can also arrival at a similar conclusion: it is impossible to localize a photon inside a waveguide with a greater precision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, which owing to evanescent-wave or photon-tunneling phenomena.

<p>
The quality factor (Q), mode volume (Veff), and room-temperature lasing threshold of microdisk cavities with embedded quantum dots (QDs) are investigated. Finite element method simulations of standing wave modes within the microdisk reveal that Veff can be as small as 2(lambda/n)^3 while maintaining radiation-limited Qs in excess of 10^5. Microdisks of diameter D=2 microns are fabricated in an AlGaAs material containing a single layer of InAs QDs with peak emission at lambda = 1317 nm. For devices with Veff ~2 (lambda/n)^3, Qs as high as 1.2 x 10^5 are measured passively in the 1.4 micron band, using an optical fiber taper waveguide. Optical pumping yields laser emission in the 1.3 micron band, with room temperature, continuous-wave thresholds as low as 1 microWatt of absorbed pump power. Out-coupling of the laser emission is also shown to be significantly enhanced through the use of optical fiber tapers, with laser differential efficiency as high as xi~16% and out-coupling efficiency in excess of 28%.
