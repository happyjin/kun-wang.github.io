    <p><strong>1.    Device-independent witnesses of genuine multipartite entanglement</strong><br>
Jean-Daniel Bancal, Nicolas Gisin, Yeong-Cherng Liang, Stefano Pironio<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 250404 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0197">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0197</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of determining whether genuine multipartite entanglement was produced in an experiment, without relying on a characterization of the systems observed or of the measurements performed. We present an n-partite inequality that is satisfied by all correlations produced by measurements on biseparable quantum states, but which can be violated by n-partite entangled states, such as GHZ states. In contrast to traditional entanglement witnesses, the violation of this inequality implies that the state is not biseparable independently of the Hilbert space dimension and of the measured operators. Violation of this inequality does not imply, however, genuine multipartite non-locality. We show more generically how the problem of identifying genuine tripartite entanglement in a device-independent way can be addressed through semidefinite programming.

<p><strong>2.    A Steady State Entanglement Witness</strong><br>
Jenny Hide<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0220">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0220</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method for entanglement detection in steady state systems using a thermodynamic witness. To illustrate, we consider an example and find that for an XX spin chain, the presence of an energy current increases the region of entanglement detected by the steady state witness. Further, we find that entanglement exists even at a high steady state temperature. We also discuss concurrence in the steady state system and find that the amount of entanglement can be increased by the current.

<p><strong>3.    Number of propagating modes of a diffusive periodic waveguide in the semiclassical limit</strong><br>
Felipe Barra, Agnes Maurel, Vincent Pagneux, Jaime Zu?iga<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0345">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0345</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the number of propagating Bloch modes N_B of an infinite periodic billiard chain. The asymptotic semiclassical behavior of this quantity depends on the phase-space dynamics of the unit cell, growing linearly with the wavenumber k in systems with a non-null measure of ballistic trajectories and going like ~ sqrt(k) in diffusive systems. We have calculated numerically N_B for a waveguide with cosine-shaped walls exhibiting strongly diffusive dynamics. The semiclassical prediction for diffusive systems is verified to good accuracy and a connection between this result and the universality of the parametric variation of energy levels is presented.

<p><strong>4.    No-signaling Principle Can Determine Optimal Quantum State Discrimination</strong><br>
Joonwoo Bae, Won-Young Hwang, Yeong-Deok Han<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0361">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0361</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We provide a general framework of utilizing the no-signaling principle in derivation of the guessing probability in the minimum-error quantum state discrimination. We show that, remarkably, the guessing probability can be determined by the no-signaling principle. This is shown by proving that in the semidefinite programming for the discrimination, the optimality condition corresponds to the constraint that quantum theory cannot be used for a superluminal communication. Finally, a general bound to the guessing probability is presented in a closed form.

<p><strong>6.    Recovery in quantum error correction for general noise without measurement</strong><br>
Chi-Kwong Li, Mikio Nakahara, Yiu-Tung Poon, Nung-Sing Sze, Hiroyuki Tomita<br>
Quantum Information &amp; Computation, 12:149-158, 2012<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is known that one can do quantum error correction without syndrome measurement, which is often done in operator quantum error correction (OQEC). However, the physical realization could be challenging, especially when the recovery process involves high-rank projection operators and a superoperator. We use operator theory to improve OQEC so that the implementation can always be done by unitary gates followed by a partial trace operation. Examples are given to show that our error correction scheme outperforms the existing ones in various scenarios.

<blockquote>
<p>
Control of spatial quantum correlations in bi-photons is one of the fundamental principles of Quantum Imaging. Up to now, experiments have been restricted to controlling the state of a single bi-photon, by using linear optical elements. In this work we demonstrate experimental control of quantum correlations in a four-photon state comprised of two pairs of photons. Our scheme is based on a high-efficiency parametric downconversion source coupled to a double slit by a variable linear optical setup, in order to obtain spatially encoded qubits. Both entangled and separable pairs have been obtained, by altering experimental parameters. We show how the correlations influence both the interference and diffraction on the double slit.

<p><strong>9.    The Quantum Theory of MIMO Markovian Feedback with Diffusive Measurements</strong><br>
A. Chia, H. M. Wiseman<br>
Phys. Rev. A 84, 012120 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3098">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3098</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Feedback control engineers have been interested in MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) extensions of SISO (single-input single-output) results of various kinds due to its rich mathematical structure and practical applications. An outstanding problem in quantum feedback control is the extension of the SISO theory of Markovian feedback by Wiseman and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70}, 548 (1993)] to multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Here we generalize the SISO homodyne-mediated feedback theory to allow for multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and \emph{arbitrary} diffusive quantum measurements. We thus obtain a MIMO framework which resembles the SISO theory and whose additional mathematical structure is highlighted by the extensive use of vector-operator algebra.

We reapply our approach to designing nanophotonic quantum memories to formulate an optical network that autonomously protects a single logical qubit against arbitrary single-qubit errors. Emulating the 9 qubit Bacon-Shor subsystem code, the network replaces the traditionally discrete syndrome measurement and correction steps by continuous, time-independent optical interactions and coherent feedback of unitarily processed optical fields.

Mohammad Hafezi, Eugene Demler, Mikhail Lukin, Jacob Taylor<br>
Nature Physics 7, 907--912 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3256">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3256</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Phenomena associated with topological properties of physical systems are naturally robust against perturbations. This robustness is exemplified by quantized conductance and edge state transport in the quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall effects. Here we show how exploiting topological properties of optical systems can be used to implement robust photonic devices. We demonstrate how quantum spin Hall Hamiltonians can be created with linear optical elements using a network of coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW) in two dimensions. We find that key features of quantum Hall systems, including the characteristic Hofstadter butterfly and robust edge state transport, can be obtained in such systems. As a specific application, we show that the topological protection can be used to dramatically improve the performance of optical delay lines and to overcome limitations related to disorder in photonic technologies.

<blockquote>
<p>
We have directly observed spin-dependent transport of single cesium atoms in a 1D optical lattice. A superposition of two circularly polarized standing waves is generated from two counter propagating, linearly polarized laser beams. Rotation of one of the polarizations by $\pi$ causes displacement of the $\sigma^{+}$- and $\sigma^{-}$-lattices by one lattice site. Unidirectional transport over several lattice sites is achieved by rotating the polarization back and forth and flipping the spin after each transport step. We have analyzed the transport efficiency over 10 and more lattice sites, and discussed and quantified relevant error sources.

<p>
We discuss in details a modified variational matrix-product-state algorithm for periodic boundary conditions, based on a recent work by P. Pippan, S.R. White and H.G. Everts, Phys. Rev. B 81, 081103(R) (2010), which enables one to study large systems on a ring (composed of N ~ 10^2 sites). In particular, we introduce a couple of improvements that allow to enhance the algorithm in terms of stability and reliability. We employ such method to compute the stiffness of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. The accuracy of our calculations is tested in the exactly solvable spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.

We present efficient methods to implement the quantum computing Grover search algorithm using the Rydberg blockade interaction. We show that simple pi-pulse excitation sequences between ground and Rydberg excited states readily produce the key conditional phase shift and inversion-about-the mean unitary operations for the Grover search. Multi-qubit implementation schemes suitable for different properties of the atomic interactions are identifed and the error scaling of the protocols with system size is found to be promising for immediate experimental investigation.

Elena Agliari<br>
Physica A (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3994">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3994</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the coherent exciton transport, modeled by continuous-time quantum walks, on Erd\&quot;{o}s-R\&#39;{e}ny graphs in the presence of a random distribution of traps. The role of trap concentration and of the substrate dilution is deepened showing that, at long times and for intermediate degree of dilution, the survival probability typically decays exponentially with a (average) decay rate which depends non monotonically on the graph connectivity; when the degree of dilution is either very low or very high, stationary states, not affected by traps, get more likely giving rise to a survival probability decaying to a finite value. Both these features constitute a qualitative difference with respect to the behavior found for classical walks.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4385">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4385</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the entanglement dynamics of discrete time quantum walks acting on bounded finite sized graphs. We demonstrate that, depending on system parameters, the dynamics may be monotonic, oscillatory but highly regular, or quasi-periodic. While the dynamics of the system are not chaotic since the system comprises linear evolution, the dynamics often exhibit some features similar to chaos such as high sensitivity to the system&#39;s parameters, irregularity and infinite periodicity. Our observations are of interest for entanglement generation, which is one primary use for the quantum walk formalism. Furthermore, we show that the systems we model can easily be mapped to optical beamsplitter networks, rendering experimental observation of quasi-periodic dynamics within reach.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks on the line with a single particle possess a classical analog. Involving more walkers opens up the possibility to study collective quantum effects, such as many particle correlations. In this context, entangled initial states and indistinguishability of the particles play a role. We consider directional correlations between two particles performing a quantum walk on a line. For non-interacting particles we find analytic asymptotic expressions and give the limits of directional correlations. We show that introducing $\delta$-interaction between the particles, one can exceed the limits for non-interacting particles.

Our non-Markovianity measure has the merit that no optimization procedure is required and it is finite for any quantum process, which greatly enhances the practical relevance of the proposed measure.

<p>
We analyze two-photon double ionization of helium in both the nonsequential and sequential regime. We show that the energy spacing between the two emitted electrons provides the key parameter that controls both the energy and the angular distribution and reveals the universal features present in both the nonsequential and sequential regime. This universality, i.e., independence of photon energy, is a manifestation of the continuity across the threshold for sequential double ionization. For all photon energies, the energy distribution can be described by a universal shape function that contains only the spectral and temporal information entering second-order time-dependent perturbation theory. Angular correlations and distributions are found to be more sensitive to the photon energy. In particular, shake-up interferences have a large effect on the angular distribution. Energy spectra, angular distributions parameterized by the anisotropy parameters, and total cross sections presented in this paper are obtained by fully correlated time-dependent ab initio calculations.

Quantum annealing is a generic solver of classical optimization problems that makes full use of quantum fluctuations.

A special symmetry, gauge symmetry, leads to a non-trivial relationship between quantum annealing toward different targets in the theory of spin glasses. We believe that our results will be a step toward an alternative realization of efficient quantum computation as well as our better understanding of nonequilibrium behavior of systems under quantum control.

<blockquote>
<p>
We face the following dilemma for designing low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) for quantum error correction. 1) The row weights of parity-check should be large: The minimum distances are bounded above by the minimum row weights of parity-check matrices of constituent classical codes. Small minimum distance tends to result in poor decoding performance at the error-floor region. 2) The row weights of parity-check matrices should not be large: The sum-product decoding performance at the water-fall region is degraded as the row weight increases. Recently, Kudekar et al. showed spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes exhibit capacity-achieving performance for classical channels. SC LDPC codes have both large row weight and capacity-achieving error-floor and water-fall performance. In this paper, we design SC LDPC-CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane) codes for quantum error correction over the depolarizing channels.

We observe and analyze d-wave resonant scattering of bosons in tightly confining harmonic waveguides. It is shown that the d-wave resonance emerges in the quasi-1D regime as an imprint of a 3D d-wave shape resonance. A scaling relation for the position of the d-wave resonance is provided. By changing the trap frequency, ultracold scattering can be continuously tuned from s-wave to d-wave resonant behavior. The effect can be utilized for the realization of ultracold atomic gases interacting via higher partial waves and opens a novel possibility for studying strongly correlated atomic systems beyond s-wave physics.

<p><strong>29.    Skyrmion Burst and Multiple Quantum Walk in Thin Ferromagnetic Films</strong><br>
Motohiko Ezawa<br>
Phys. Lett. A 375, 3610 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0635">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0635</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A giant Skyrmion collapses to a singular point by emitting spin waves in a thin ferromagnetic film, when external magnetic field is increased beyond the critical one. The remnant is a single-spin flipped (SSF) point. The SSF point has a quantum diffusion dynamics governed by the Heisenberg model. We determine its time evolution and show the diffusion process is a continuous-time quantum walk. We also analyze an interference of two SSF points after two Skyrmion bursts. Quantum walks for $S=1/2$ and 1 are exact solvable. The system presents a new type of quantum walk for $S&gt;1/2$, where a SSF point breaks into 2S quantum walkers. It is interesting that we can create quantum walkers experimentally at any points in a magnetic thin film, first by creating Skyrmions sequentially and then by letting them collapse simultaneously.

<p><strong>30.    Optical Forces Between Coupled Plasmonic Nano-particles near Metal Surfaces and Negative Index Material Waveguides</strong><br>
C. Van Vlack, P. Yao, S. Hughes<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0794">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0794</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a study of light-induced forces between two coupled plasmonic nano-particles above various slab geometries including a metallic half-space and a 280-nm thick negative index material (NIM) slab waveguide. We investigate optical forces by non-perturbatively calculating the scattered electric field via a Green function technique which includes the particle interactions to all orders. For excitation frequencies near the surface plasmon polariton and slow-light waveguide modes of the metal and NIM, respectively, we find rich light-induced forces and significant dynamical back-action effects. Optical quenching is found to be important in both metal and NIM planar geometries, which reduces the spatial range of the achievable inter-particle forces. However, reducing the loss in the NIM allows radiation to propagate through the slow-light modes more efficiently, thus causing the light-induced forces to be more pronounced between the two particles. To highlight the underlying mechanisms by which the particles couple, we connect our Green function calculations to various familiar quantities in quantum optics.
