    <p><strong>1.    Field-induced decay of quantum vacuum: visualizing pair production in a classical photonic system</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The phenomenon of vacuum decay, i.e. electron-positron pair production due to the instability of the quantum electrodynamics vacuum in an external field, is a remarkable prediction of Dirac theory whose experimental observation is still lacking. Here a classic wave optics analogue of vacuum decay, based on light propagation in curved waveguide superlattices, is proposed. Our photonic analogue enables a simple and experimentally-accessible visualization in space of the process of pair production as break up of an initially negative-energy Gaussian wave packet, representing an electron in the Dirac sea, under the influence of an oscillating electric field.

<p><strong>2.    Interference Phenomena in Quantum Information</strong><br>
Martin Stefanak<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the key features of quantum mechanics is the interference of probability amplitudes. The reason for the appearance of interference is mathematically very simple. It is the linear structure of the Hilbert space which is used for the description of quantum systems. In terms of physics we usually talk about the superposition principle valid for individual and composed quantum objects. So, while the source of interference is understandable it leads in fact to many counter-intuitive physical phenomena which puzzle physicists for almost hundred years. The present thesis studies interference in two seemingly disjoint fields of physics. However, both have strong links to quantum information processing and hence are related. In the first part we study the intriguing properties of quantum walks. In the second part we analyze a sophisticated application of wave packet dynamics in atoms and molecules for factorization of integers. The main body of the thesis is based on the original contributions listed separately at the end of the thesis. The more technical aspects and brief summaries of used methods are left for appendices.

<p><strong>3.    Finding structural anomalies in graphs by means of quantum walks</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the possibility of using quantum walks on graphs to find structural anomalies, such as extra edges or loops, on a graph. We focus our attention on star graphs, whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central hub. If there are $N$ spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps. We initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one, the walk will not find the spoke without a loop, but this can be fixed if we choose the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the loop. Consequently, quantum walks can, under some circumstances, be used to find structural anomalies in graphs.

The reversible transfer of quantum states of light in and out of matter constitutes an important building block for future applications of quantum communication: it allows synchronizing quantum information, and enables one to build quantum repeaters and quantum networks. Much effort has been devoted worldwide over the past years to develop memories suitable for the storage of quantum states. Of central importance to this task is the preservation of entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon whose counter intuitive properties have occupied philosophers, physicists and computer scientists since the early days of quantum physics. Here we report, for the first time, the reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a photon and collective atomic excitation in a solid-state device. Towards this end, we employ a thulium-doped lithium niobate waveguide in conjunction with a photon-echo quantum memory protocol, and increase the spectral acceptance from the current maximum of 100 MHz to 5 GHz. The entanglement-preserving nature of our storage device is assessed by comparing the amount of entanglement contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible transfer, showing, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our integrated, broadband quantum memory complements the family of robust, integrated lithium niobate devices. It renders frequency matching of light with matter interfaces in advanced applications of quantum communication trivial and institutes several key properties in the quest to unleash the full potential of quantum communication.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the single particle dynamics of a mobile non-Abelian anyon hopping around many pinned anyons on a surface. The dynamics is modelled by a discrete time quantum walk and the spatial degree of freedom of the mobile anyon becomes entangled with the fusion degrees of freedom of the collective system. Each quantum trajectory makes a closed braid on the world lines of the particles establishing a direct connection between statistical dynamics and quantum link invariants. We find that asymptotically a mobile Ising anyon becomes so entangled with its environment that its statistical dynamics reduces to a classical random walk with linear dispersion in contrast to particles with Abelian statistics which have quadratic dispersion.

<p><strong>6.    Canonical form of master equations and characterization of non-Markovianity</strong><br>

Phys. Rev. A 89, 042120 (2014)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0845">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0845</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Master equations govern the time evolution of a quantum system interacting with an environment, and may be written in a variety of forms. Time-independent or memoryless master equations, in particular, can be cast in the well-known Lindblad form. Any time-local master equation, Markovian or non-Markovian, may in fact also be written in a Lindblad-like form. A diagonalisation procedure results in a unique, and in this sense canonical, representation of the equation, which may be used to fully characterize the non-Markovianity of the time evolution. Recently, several different measures of non-Markovianity have been presented which reflect, to varying degrees, the appearance of negative decoherence rates in the Lindblad-like form of the master equation. We therefore propose using the negative decoherence rates themselves, as they appear in the canonical form of the master equation, to completely characterize non-Markovianity. The advantages of this are especially apparent when more than one decoherence channel is present. We show that a measure proposed by Rivas et al. is a surprisingly simple function of the canonical decoherence rates, and give an example of a master equation that is non-Markovian for all times t&gt;0, but to which nearly all proposed measures are blind. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for trace distance and volume measures to witness non-Markovianity, in terms of the Bloch damping matrix.

<p><strong>7.    Limit Theorems for the Discrete-Time Quantum Walk on a Graph with Joined Half Lines</strong><br>
Kota Chisaki, Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa<br>
Quantum Information and Computation 12, (2012) 0314--0333<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1306">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1306</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider a discrete-time quantum walk $W_{t,\kappa}$ at time $t$ on a graph with joined half lines $\mathbb{J}<em>\kappa$, which is composed of $\kappa$ half lines with the same origin. Our analysis is based on a reduction of the walk on a half line. The idea plays an important role to analyze the walks on some class of graphs with \textit{symmetric} initial states. In this paper, we introduce a quantum walk with an enlarged basis and show that $W</em>{t,\kappa}$ can be reduced to the walk on a half line even if the initial state is \textit{asymmetric}. For $W_{t,\kappa}$, we obtain two types of limit theorems. The first one is an asymptotic behavior of $W_{t,\kappa}$ which corresponds to localization. For some conditions, we find that the asymptotic behavior oscillates. The second one is the weak convergence theorem for $W_{t,\kappa}$. On each half line, $W_{t,\kappa}$ converges to a density function like the case of the one-dimensional lattice with a scaling order of $t$. The results contain the cases of quantum walks starting from the general initial state on a half line with the general coin and homogeneous trees with the Grover coin.

<p><strong>8.    NP-hardness of decoding quantum error-correction codes</strong><br>

Physical Review A 83, 052331 (2011)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1319">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1319</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Though the theory of quantum error correction is intimately related to the classical coding theory, in particular, one can construct quantum error correction codes (QECCs) from classical codes with the dual containing property, this does not necessarily imply that the computational complexity of decoding QECCs is the same as their classical counterparts. Instead, decoding QECCs can be very much different from decoding classical codes due to the degeneracy property. Intuitively, one expect degeneracy would simplify the decoding since two different errors might not and need not be distinguished in order to correct them. However, we show that general quantum decoding problem is NP-hard regardless of the quantum codes being degenerate or non-degenerate. This finding implies that no considerably fast decoding algorithm exists for the general quantum decoding problems, and suggests the existence of a quantum cryptosystem based on the hardness of decoding QECCs.

<p><strong>9.    Perfect state transfer, graph products and equitable partitions</strong><br>
Yang Ge, Benjamin Greenberg, Oscar Perez, Christino Tamon<br>

We describe new constructions of graphs which exhibit perfect state transfer on continuous-time quantum walks. Our constructions are based on variants of the double cones [BCMS09,ANOPRT10,ANOPRT09] and the Cartesian graph products (which includes the n-cube) [CDDEKL05]. Some of our results include: (1) If $G$ is a graph with perfect state transfer at time $t_{G}$, where $t_{G}\Spec(G) \subseteq \ZZ\pi$, and $H$ is a circulant with odd eigenvalues, their weak product $G \times H$ has perfect state transfer. Also, if $H$ is a regular graph with perfect state transfer at time $t_{H}$ and $G$ is a graph where $t_{H}|V_{H}|\Spec(G) \subseteq 2\ZZ\pi$, their lexicographic product $G[H]$ has perfect state transfer. (2) The double cone $\overline{K}<em>{2} + G$ on any connected graph $G$, has perfect state transfer if the weights of the cone edges are proportional to the Perron eigenvector of $G$. This generalizes results for double cone on regular graphs studied in [BCMS09,ANOPRT10,ANOPRT09]. (3) For an infinite family $\GG$ of regular graphs, there is a circulant connection so the graph $K</em>{1}+\GG\circ\GG+K_{1}$ has perfect state transfer. In contrast, no perfect state transfer exists if a complete bipartite connection is used (even in the presence of weights) [ANOPRT09]. We also describe a generalization of the path collapsing argument [CCDFGS03,CDDEKL05], which reduces questions about perfect state transfer to simpler (weighted) multigraphs, for graphs with equitable distance partitions.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the asymptotic position distribution of general quantum walks on a lattice, including walks with a random coin, which is chosen from step to step by a general Markov chain. In the unitary (i.e., non-random) case, we allow any unitary operator, which commutes with translations, and couples only sites at a finite distance from each other. For example, a single step of the walk could be composed of any finite succession of different shift and coin operations in the usual sense, with any lattice dimension and coin dimension. We find ballistic scaling, and establish a direct method for computing the asymptotic distribution of position divided by time, namely as the distribution of the discrete time analog of the group velocity. In the random case, we let a Markov chain (control process) pick in each step one of finitely many unitary walks, in the sense described above. In ballistic order we find a non-random drift, which depends only on the mean of the control process and not on the initial state. In diffusive scaling the limiting distribution is asymptotically Gaussian, with a covariance matrix (diffusion matrix) depending on momentum. The diffusion matrix depends not only on the mean but also on the transition rates of the control process. In the non-random limit, i.e., when the coins chosen are all very close, or the transition rates of the control process are small, leading to long intervals of ballistic evolution, the diffusion matrix diverges. Our method is based on spatial Fourier transforms, and the first and second order perturbation theory of the eigenvalue 1 of the transition operator for each value of the momentum.

<p><strong>11.    Crossovers induced by discrete-time quantum walks</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs in some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show that the position measurements per each step with probability $p \sim 1/n^\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0&lt;\beta<1$. We also give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers from the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum walk) can be seen as the parameter $\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete- and continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we introduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the final time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW is obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence theorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties. Finally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently long-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random walks.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction allows for faulty quantum systems to behave in an effectively error free manner. One important class of techniques for quantum error correction is the class of quantum subsystem codes, which are relevant both to active quantum error correcting schemes as well as to the design of self-correcting quantum memories. Previous approaches for investigating these codes have focused on applying theoretical analysis to look for interesting codes and to investigate their properties. In this paper we present an alternative approach that uses computational analysis to accomplish the same goals. Specifically, we present an algorithm that computes the optimal quantum subsystem code that can be implemented given an arbitrary set of measurement operators that are tensor products of Pauli operators. We then demonstrate the utility of this algorithm by performing a systematic investigation of the quantum subsystem codes that exist in the setting where the interactions are limited to 2-body interactions between neighbors on lattices derived from the convex uniform tilings of the plane.

<p><strong>13.    Minimal-memory realization of pearl-necklace encoders of general quantum convolutional codes</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum convolutional codes, like their classical counterparts, promise to offer higher error correction performance than block codes of equivalent encoding complexity, and are expected to find important applications in reliable quantum communication where a continuous stream of qubits is transmitted. Grassl and Roetteler devised an algorithm to encode a quantum convolutional code with a &quot;pearl-necklace encoder.&quot; Despite their theoretical significance as a neat way of representing quantum convolutional codes, they are not well-suited to practical realization. In fact, there is no straightforward way to implement any given pearl-necklace structure. This paper closes the gap between theoretical representation and practical implementation. In our previous work, we presented an efficient algorithm for finding a minimal-memory realization of a pearl-necklace encoder for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) convolutional codes. This work extends our previous work and presents an algorithm for turning a pearl-necklace encoder for a general (non-CSS) quantum convolutional code into a realizable quantum convolutional encoder. We show that a minimal-memory realization depends on the commutativity relations between the gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder. We find a realization by means of a weighted graph which details the non-commutative paths through the pearl-necklace. The weight of the longest path in this graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. The algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity in the number of gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.

Our results explicitly exhibit the photon blockade effects in the strong atom-cavity coupling regime.

The precise maximum tolerable error rate depends on the error model, and we calculate values in the range 1.1--1.4% for various physically reasonable models. Even the lowest value represents the highest threshold error rate calculated to date in a geometrically constrained setting, and a 50% improvement over the previous record.

<blockquote>
<p>
Most experimental realizations of quantum key distribution are based on the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (so-called BB84) protocol. In a typical optical implementation of this scheme, the sender uses an active source to produce the required BB84 signal states. While active state preparation of BB84 signals is a simple and elegant solution in principle, in practice passive state preparation might be desirable in some scenarios, for instance, in those experimental setups operating at high transmission rates. Passive schemes might also be more robust against side-channel attacks than active sources. Typical passive devices involve parametric down-conversion. In this paper, we show that both coherent light and practical single photon sources are also suitable for passive generation of BB84 signal states. Our method does not require any external-driven element, but only linear optical components and photodetectors. In the case of coherent light, the resulting key rate is similar to the one delivered by an active source. When the sender uses practical single photon sources, however, the distance covered by a passive transmitter might be longer than the one of an active configuration.

<p><strong>23.    Temperature Dependent Performances of Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors in an Ultralow-Temperature Region</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We present the performances of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) in an ultralow-temperature region from 16 mK to 4 K. The system detection efficiency of the SNSPD showed saturation in the bias-current and temperature dependences, and reached the considerably high value of 15% for 100 Hz dark count rate below 1.4 K at a wavelength of 1550 nm even without an optical cavity structure. We found that the dark count exists even at 16 mK and black body radiation becomes its dominant origin in the low temperatures for fiber-coupled devices.

<p><strong>24.    Quantum Entanglement Initiated Super Raman Scattering</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
It has now been possible to prepare chain of ions in an entangled state and thus question arises --- how the optical properties of a chain of entangled ions differ from say a chain of independent particles. We investigate nonlinear optical processes in such chains. We explicitly demonstrate the possibility of entanglement produced super Raman scattering. Our results in contrast to Dicke&#39;s work on superradiance are applicable to stimulated processes and are thus free from the standard complications of multimode quantum electrodynamics. Our results suggest the possibility of similar enhancement factors in other nonlinear processes like four wave mixing.

<p><strong>25.    Continuous Quantum Error Correction Through Local Operations</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose local strategies to protect global quantum information. The protocols, which are quantum error correcting codes for dissipative systems, are based on environment measurements, direct feedback control and simple encoding of the logical qubits into physical qutrits whose decaying transitions are indistinguishable and equally probable. The simple addition of one extra level in the description of the subsystems allows for local actions to fully and deterministically protect global resources, such as entanglement. We present codes for both quantum jump and quantum state diffusion measurement strategies and test them against several sources of inefficiency. The use of qutrits in information protocols suggests further characterization of qutrit-qutrit disentanglement dynamics, which we also give together with simple local environment measurement schemes able to prevent distillability sudden death and even enhance entanglement in situations in which our feedback error correction is not possible.

<p><strong>26.    The Equivalence of Sampling and Searching</strong><br>
Scott Aaronson<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5104">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5104</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a sampling problem, we are given an input x, and asked to sample approximately from a probability distribution D_x. In a search problem, we are given an input x, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A_x with high probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent. More precisely, for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R_S such that, if C is any &quot;reasonable&quot; complexity class, then R_S is in the search version of C if and only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that SampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can efficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and only if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers can solve. A second application is that, assuming a plausible conjecture, there exists a search problem R that can be solved using a simple linear-optics experiment, but that cannot be solved efficiently by a classical computer unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. That application will be described in a forthcoming paper with Alex Arkhipov on the computational complexity of linear optics.

<p><strong>28.    Non-Markovian Relaxation of a Three-Level System: Quantum Trajectory Approach</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The non-Markovian dynamics of a three-level quantum system coupled to a bosonic environment is a difficult problem due to the lack of an exact dynamic equation such as a master equation. We present for the first time an exact quantum trajectory approach to a dissipative three-level model. We have established a convolutionless stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation called time-local quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation without any approximations, in particular, without Markov approximation. Our exact time-local QSD equation opens a new avenue for exploring quantum dynamics for a higher dimensional quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5325">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5325</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Strong coupling between a two-level system (TLS) and bosonic modes produces dramatic quantum optics effects. We consider a one-dimensional continuum of bosons coupled to a single localized TLS, a system which may be realized in a variety of plasmonic, photonic, or electronic contexts. We present the exact many-body scattering eigenstate obtained by imposing open boundary conditions. Multi-photon bound states appear in the scattering of two or more photons due to the coupling between the photons and the TLS. Such bound states are shown to have a large effect on scattering of both Fock and coherent state wavepackets, especially in the intermediate coupling strength regime. We compare the statistics of the transmitted light with a coherent state having the same mean photon number: as the interaction strength increases, the one-photon probability is suppressed rapidly, and the two- and three-photon probabilities are greatly enhanced due to the many-body bound states. This results in non-Poissonian light.

<blockquote>
<p>
The first realization of solid state quantum computer was demonstrated recently by using artificial atoms -- transmons in superconducting resonator. Here, we propose a novel architecture of flexible and scalable quantum computer based on a waveguide circuit coupling many quantum nodes of controlled atomic ensembles. For the first time, we found the optimal practically attainable parameters of the atoms and circuit for 100% efficiency of quantum memory for multi qubit photon fields and confirmed experimentally the predicted perfect storage. Then we revealed self modes for reversible transfer of qubits between the quantum memory node and arbitrary other nodes. We found a realization of iSWAP gate via direct coupling of two arbitrary nodes with a processing rate accelerated proportionally to number of atoms in the node. A large number of the two-qubit gates can be simultaneously realized in the circuit for implementation of parallel quantum processing. Dynamic coherent elimination procedure of excess quantum state and collective blockade mechanism are proposed for realization of $iSWAP$ and $\sqrt {iSWAP} $ quantum gates.

<blockquote>
<p>
A continuously monitored quantum system prepared in an excited state will decay to its ground state with an abrupt jump. The jump occurs stochastically on a characteristic time scale T1, the lifetime of the excited state. These quantum jumps, originally envisioned by Bohr, have been observed in trapped atoms and ions, single molecules, photons, and single electrons in cyclotrons. Here we report the first observation of quantum jumps in a macroscopic quantum system, in our case a superconducting &quot;artificial atom&quot; or quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. We use a fast, ultralow-noise parametric amplifier to amplify the microwave photons used to probe the qubit state, enabling continuous high-fidelity monitoring of the qubit. This technique represents a major step forward for solid state quantum information processing, potentially enabling quantum error correction and feedback, which are essential for building a quantum computer. Our technology can also be readily integrated into hybrid circuits involving molecular magnets, nitrogen vacancies in diamond, or semiconductor quantum dots.

<blockquote>
<p>
We report a technique that uses clouds of ultracold atoms as sensitive, tunable, and non-invasive probes for microwave field imaging with micrometer spatial resolution. The microwave magnetic field components drive Rabi oscillations on atomic hyperfine transitions whose frequency can be tuned with a static magnetic field. Readout is accomplished using state-selective absorption imaging. Quantitative data extraction is simple and it is possible to reconstruct the distribution of microwave magnetic field amplitudes and phases. While we demonstrate 2d imaging, an extension to 3d imaging is straightforward. We use the method to determine the microwave near-field distribution around a coplanar waveguide integrated on an atom chip.

<p><strong>33.    Universal quantum control of two-electron spin quantum bits using dynamic nuclear polarization</strong><br>

Nature Physics 5, 903-908 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5343">http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5343</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
One fundamental requirement for quantum computation is to perform universal manipulations of quantum bits at rates much faster than the qubit&#39;s rate of decoherence. Recently, fast gate operations have been demonstrated in logical spin qubits composed of two electron spins where the rapid exchange of the two electrons permits electrically controllable rotations around one axis of the qubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations around at least two axes. Here we show that by subjecting each electron spin to a magnetic field of different magnitude we achieve full quantum control of the two-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single device, a magnetic field gradient of several hundred milliTesla is generated and sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As nuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using quantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single and potentially multiple qubit operations with gate times that approach the threshold required for quantum error correction.

A zeptosecond multi--MeV laser pulse may either excite a &quot;plasma&quot; of strongly interacting nucleons or a collective mode. We derive the conditions on laser energy and photon number such that either of these scenarios is realized. We use the nuclear Giant Dipole Resonance as a representative example, and a random--matrix description of the fine--structure states and perturbation theory as tools.
