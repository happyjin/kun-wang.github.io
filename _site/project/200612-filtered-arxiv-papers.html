    <p><strong>1.    Error-detection-based quantum fault tolerance against discrete Pauli noise</strong><br>
Ben W. Reichardt<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612004">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612004</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum computer -- i.e., a computer capable of manipulating data in quantum superposition -- would find applications including factoring, quantum simulation and tests of basic quantum theory. Since quantum superpositions are fragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise. Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault tolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to tolerate as much as 3-6% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than previous procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising fault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all. With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions into mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant tolerable noise rates (&quot;noise thresholds&quot;) for error-detection-based schemes. Numerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method yields is lower-bounded by 0.1% noise per gate.

<p><strong>2.    Efficient classical simulation of the semi-classical Quantum Fourier Transform</strong><br>
Daniel E. Browne<br>
New J. Phys. 9 146 (2007).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612021">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612021</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A number of elegant approaches have been developed for the identification of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Recently, these methods have been employed to demonstrate the classical simulability of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). In this note, we show that one can demonstrate a number of simulability results for QFT circuits in a straightforward manner using Griffiths and Niu&#39;s semi-classical QFT construction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3228 (1996)]. We then discuss the consequences of these results in the context of Shor&#39;s factorisation algorithm.

<p><strong>3.    The universe as an eigenstate: spacetime paths and decoherence</strong><br>
Ed Seidewitz<br>
Found.Phys.37:572,2007<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612023">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612023</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper describes how the entire universe might be considered an eigenstate determined by classical limiting conditions within it. This description is in the context of an approach in which the path of each relativistic particle in spacetime represents a fine-grained history for that particle, and a path integral represents a coarse-grained history as a superposition of paths meeting some criteria. Since spacetime paths are parametrized by an invariant parameter, not time, histories based on such paths do not evolve in time but are rather histories of all spacetime. Measurements can then be represented by orthogonal states that correlate with specific points in such coarse-grained histories, causing them to decohere, allowing a consistent probability interpretation. This conception is applied here to the analysis of the two slit experiment, scattering and, ultimately, the universe as a whole. The decoherence of cosmological states of the universe then provides the eigenstates from which our &quot;real&quot; universe can be selected by the measurements carried out within it.

<p><strong>4.    Approche intrinsèque des fluctuations quantiques en mécanique stochastique (An intrinsic approach of the quantum fluctuations in stochastic mechanics)</strong><br>
Michel Fliess<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612033">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612033</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
This note is answering an old questioning about the F\&#39;{e}nyes-Nelson stochastic mechanics. The Brownian nature of the quantum fluctuations, which are associated to this mechanics, is deduced from Feynman&#39;s interpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle via infinitesimal random walks stemming from nonstandard analysis. It is therefore no more necessary to combine those fluctuations with a background field, which has never been well understood. Most of the technical details are contained in an extended english abstract.

<p><strong>5.    Quasiprobability methods for multimode conditional optical gates</strong><br>
G.J.Milburn<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612040">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612040</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a method for computing the action of conditional linear optical transformations, conditioned on photon counting, for arbitrary signal states. The method is based on the Q-function, a quasi probability distribution for anti normally ordered moments. We treat an arbitrary number of signal and ancilla modes. The ancilla modes are prepared in an arbitrary product number state. We construct the conditional, non unitary, signal transformations for an arbitrary photon number count on each of the ancilla modes.

<p><strong>6.    Alternative perspective on photonic tunneling</strong><br>
Zhi-Yong Wang, Cai-Dong Xiong, Bing He<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612069">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612069</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A relativistic quantum-mechanical description of guided waves is given, based on which we present an alternative way to describe and interpret the propagation of electromagnetic wave packets through an undersized waveguide. In particular, we show that the superluminal phenomenon of evanescent modes is actually a known conclusion in quantum field theory, and it preserves a quantum-mechanical causality.

<p><strong>7.    Fault-tolerant linear optics quantum computation by error-detecting quantum state transfer</strong><br>
Jaeyoon Cho<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 042311 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612073">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612073</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A scheme for linear optical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computation is proposed, which is based on an error-detecting code. Each computational step is mediated by transfer of quantum information into an ancilla system embedding error-detection capability. Photons are assumed to be subjected to both photon loss and depolarization, and the threshold region of their strengths for scalable quantum computation is obtained, together with the amount of physical resources consumed. Compared to currently known results, the present scheme reduces the resource requirement, while yielding a comparable threshold region.

<p><strong>8.    Stabilizer Quantum Error Correction with Qubus Computation</strong><br>
Casey R. Myers, Marcus Silva, Kae Nemoto, William J. Munro<br>
Phys. Rev. A 76, 012303 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612097">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612097</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we investigate stabilizer quantum error correction codes using controlled phase rotations of strong coherent probe states. We explicitly describe two methods to measure the Pauli operators which generate the stabilizer group of a quantum code. First, we show how to measure a Pauli operator acting on physical qubits using a single coherent state with large average photon number, displacement operations, and photon detection. Second, we show how to measure the stabilizer operators fault-tolerantly by the deterministic preparation of coherent cat states along with one-bit teleportations between a qubit-like encoding of coherent states and physical qubits.

<p><strong>9.    Entanglement quantification with Fisher information</strong><br>
Akira kitagawa, Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki, Anthony Chefles<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612099">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612099</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the Fisher information associated with entanglement-assisted coding has a monotonic relationship with the logarithmic negativity, an important entanglement measure, for certain classes of continuous variable (CV) quantum states of practical significance. These are the two-mode squeezed states and the non-Gaussian states obtained from them by photon subtraction. This monotonic correspondence can be expressed analytically in the case of pure states. Numerical analysis shows that this relationship holds to a very good approximation even in the mixed state case of the photon-subtracted squeezed states. The Fisher information is evaluated by the CV Bell measurement in the limit of weak signal modulation. Our results suggest that the logarithmic negativity of certain sets of non-Gaussian mixed states can be experimentally accessed without homodyne tomography, leading to significant simplification of the experimental procedure.

<p><strong>10.    Theoretical evidence for the superluminality of evanescent modes</strong><br>
Zhi-Yong Wang, Cai-Dong Xiong<br>
Physical Review A 75, 042105 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612102">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612102</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Though both theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed the superluminal behavior of evanescent electromagnetic waves, there are many disputes about the physical meaning and validity of such superluminal phenomenon, which is due to the fact that the traditional investigations are based on the theory of tunneling time, and concerned with the problem of what the group velocity of evanescent waves means. In this paper, by studying the quantum probability amplitude for photons to propagate over a spacelike interval along an undersized waveguide, we present theoretical evidence for such superluminality.

<p><strong>12.    Continuous-Variable Quantum Cloning of Coherent states with Phase-Conjugate Input Modes Using Linear Optics</strong><br>
Haixia Chen, Jing Zhang<br>
Phys. Rev. A 75, 022306 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612157">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612157</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a scheme for continuous-variable quantum cloning of coherent states with phase-conjugate input modes using linear optics. The quantum cloning machine yields $M$ identical optimal clones from $N$ replicas of a coherent state and $N$ its replicas of phase conjugate. This scheme can be straightforwardly implemented with the setup accessible at present since its optical implementation only employs simple linear optical elements and homodyne detection. Compared with the original scheme for continuous variables quantum cloning with phase-conjugate input modes proposed by Cerf and Iblisdir [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 247903 (2001)], which utilized a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier, our scheme loses the output of phase-conjugate clones and is regarded as irreversible quantum cloning.

<blockquote>
<p>
A central challenge for implementing quantum computing in the solid state is decoupling the qubits from the intrinsic noise of the material. We investigate the implementation of quantum gates for a paradigmatic, non-Markovian model: A single qubit coupled to a two-level system that is exposed to a heat bath. We systematically search for optimal pulses using a generalization of the novel open systems Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm. We show and explain that next to the known optimal bias point of this model, there are optimal shapes which refocus unwanted terms in the Hamiltonian. We study the limitations of controls set by the decoherence properties. This can lead to a significant improvement of quantum operations in hostile environments.

<p><strong>14.    A photon loss tolerant Zeno CSIGN gate</strong><br>
Casey R. Myers, Alexei Gilchrist<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612176">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612176</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We model an optical implementation of a CSIGN gate that makes use of the Quantum Zeno effect [1,2] in the presence of photon loss. The raw operation of the gate is severely affected by this type of loss. However, we show that by using the same photon loss codes that have been proposed for linear optical quantum computation (LOQC), the performance is greatly enhanced and such gates can outperform LOQC equivalents. The technique can be applied to other types of nonlinearities, making the implementation of nonlinear optical gates much more attractive.

The purpose of this little survey is to give a simple description of the main approaches to quantum error correction and quantum fault-tolerance. Our goal is to convey the necessary intuitions both for the problems and their solutions in this area. After characterising quantum errors we present several error-correction schemes and outline the elements of a full fledged fault-tolerant computation, which works error-free even though all of its components can be faulty. We also mention alternative approaches to error-correction, so called error-avoiding or decoherence-free schemes. Technical details and generalisations are kept to a minimum.

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a minimal language combining both higher-order computation and linear algebra. Roughly, this is nothing else than the Lambda-calculus together with the possibility to make linear combinations of terms a.t+b.u. We describe how to &quot;execute&quot; this language in terms of a few rewrite rules, and justify them through the two fundamental requirements that the language be a language of linear operators, and that it be higher-order. We mention the perspectives of this work in field of quantum computation, whose circuits we show can be easily encoded in the calculus. Finally we prove the confluence of the calculus, this is our main result. Keywords: quantum programming language, quantum control, quantum logic, probabilistic and quantitative analysis, rewriting techniques.

<p><strong>18.    Decoherence vs entanglement in coined quantum walks</strong><br>
Olivier Maloyer, Viv Kendon<br>
New J. Phys. 9 (2007) 87<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612229">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612229</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum versions of random walks on the line and cycle show a quadratic improvement in their spreading rate and mixing times respectively. The addition of decoherence to the quantum walk produces a more uniform distribution on the line, and even faster mixing on the cycle by removing the need for time-averaging to obtain a uniform distribution. We calculate numerically the entanglement between the coin and the position of the quantum walker and show that the optimal decoherence rates are such that all the entanglement is just removed by the time the final measurement is made.

<p><strong>19.    Non-Markovian reduced dynamics and entanglement evolution of two coupled spins in a quantum spin environment</strong><br>
Xiao-Zhong Yuan, Hsi-Sheng Goan, Ka-Di Zhu<br>
Phys. Rev. B 75, 045331 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612049">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612049</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The exact quantum dynamics of the reduced density matrix of two coupled spin qubits in a quantum Heisenberg XY spin star environment in the thermodynamic limit at arbitrarily finite temperatures is obtained using a novel operator technique. In this approach, the transformed Hamiltonian becomes effectively Jaynes-Cumming like and thus the analysis is also relevant to cavity quantum electrodynamics. This special operator technique is mathematically simple and physically clear, and allows us to treat systems and environments that could all be strongly coupled mutually and internally. To study their entanglement evolution, the concurrence of the reduced density matrix of the two coupled central spins is also obtained exactly. It is shown that the dynamics of the entanglement depends on the initial state of the system and the coupling strength between the two coupled central spins, the thermal temperature of the spin environment and the interaction between the constituents of the spin environment. We also investigate the effect of detuning which in our model can be controlled by the strength of a locally applied external magnetic field. It is found that the detuning has a significant effect on the entanglement generation between the two spin qubits.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612057">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0612057</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference pattern in the electron transmission through a mesoscopic ring in which two identical non-interacting magnetic impurities are embedded. Adopting a quantum waveguide theory, we derive the exact transmission probability amplitudes and study the influence of maximally entangled states of the impurity spins on the electron transmittivity interference pattern. For suitable electron wave vectors, we show that the amplitude of AB oscillations in the absence of impurities is in fact not reduced within a wide range of the electron-impurity coupling constant when the maximally entangled singlet state is prepared. Such state is thus able to inhibit the usual electron decoherence due to scattering by magnetic impurities. We also show how this maximally entangled state of the impurity spins can be generated via electron scattering.
