    <p><strong>1.    An atom mirror etched from a hard drive</strong><br>
Benjamin Lev, Yves Lassailly, Chungsok Lee, Axel Scherer, Hideo Mabuchi<br>
Published in Appl. Phys. Lett., 83, 395 (2003).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304003">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304003</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe the fabrication of an atom mirror by etching of a common hard drive, and we report the observation of specular retroreflection of 11 uk cesium atoms using this mirror. The atoms were trapped and cooled above the hard drive using the mirror magneto-optical trap technique, and upon release, two full bounces were detected. The hard drive atom mirror will be a useful tool for both atom optics and quantum computation.

<p><strong>2.    Structure of states which satisfy strong subadditivity of quantum entropy with equality</strong><br>
Patrick Hayden, Richard Jozsa, Denes Petz, Andreas Winter<br>
Commun. Math. Phys., 246(2):359-374, 2004<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304007">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304007</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We give an explicit characterisation of the quantum states which saturate the strong subadditivity inequality for the von Neumann entropy. By combining a result of Petz characterising the equality case for the monotonicity of relative entropy with a recent theorem by Koashi and Imoto, we show that such states will have the form of a so-called short quantum Markov chain, which in turn implies that two of the systems are independent conditioned on the third, in a physically meaningful sense. This characterisation simultaneously generalises known necessary and sufficient entropic conditions for quantum error correction as well as the conditions for the achievability of the Holevo bound on accessible information.

<p><strong>3.    Quantum Computing and Error Correction</strong><br>
A. M. Steane<br>
A. Steane in &quot;Decoherence and its implications in quantum computation and information transfer&quot;, Gonis and Turchi, eds, pp.284-298 (IOS Press, Amsterdam, 2001)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304016">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304016</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The main ideas of quantum error correction are introduced. These are encoding, extraction of syndromes, error operators, and code construction. It is shown that general noise and relaxation of a set of 2-state quantum systems can always be understood as a combination of Pauli operators acting on the system. Each quantum error correcting code allows a subset of these errors to be corrected. In many situations the noise is such that the remaining uncorrectable errors are unlikely to arise, and hence quantum error correction has a high probability of success. In order to achieve the best noise tolerance in the presence of noise and imprecision throughout the computer, a hierarchical construction of a quantum computer is proposed.

<p><strong>4.    Unambiguous quantum state filtering</strong><br>
Masahiro Takeoka, Masashi Ban, Masahide Sasaki<br>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304032">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304032</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider the generalized measurement where one particular quantum signal is unambiguously extracted from a set of non-commutative quantum signals and the other signals are filtered out. Simple expressions for the maximum detection probability and its POVM are derived. We applyl such unambiguous quantum state filtering to evaluation of the sensing of decoherence channels. The bounds of the precision limit for a given quantum state of probes and possible device implementations are discussed.

<p><strong>5.    Exceeding classical capacity limit in quantum optical channel</strong><br>
Mikio Fujiwara, Masahiro Takeoka, Jun Mizuno, Masahide Sasaki<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 167906 (2003).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304037">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304037</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The amount of information transmissible through a communications channel is determined by the noise characteristics of the channel and by the quantities of available transmission resources. In classical information theory, the amount of transmissible information can be increased twice at most when the transmission resource (e.g. the code length, the bandwidth, the signal power) is doubled for fixed noise characteristics. In quantum information theory, however, the amount of information transmitted can increase even more than twice. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of this super-additivity of classical capacity of a quantum channel by using the ternary symmetric states of a single photon, and by event selection from a weak coherent light source. We also show how the super-additive coding gain, even in a small code length, can boost the communication performance of conventional coding technique.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum Search on Bounded-Error Inputs</strong><br>
Peter Hoyer, Michele Mosca, Ronald de Wolf<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304052">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304052</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose we have n algorithms, quantum or classical, each computing some bit-value with bounded error probability. We describe a quantum algorithm that uses O(sqrt{n}) repetitions of the base algorithms and with high probability finds the index of a 1-bit among these n bits (if there is such an index). This shows that it is not necessary to first significantly reduce the error probability in the base algorithms to O(1/poly(n)) (which would require O(sqrt{n}log n) repetitions in total). Our technique is a recursive interleaving of amplitude amplification and error-reduction, and may be of more general interest. Essentially, it shows that quantum amplitude amplification can be made to work also with a bounded-error verifier. As a corollary we obtain optimal quantum upper bounds of O(sqrt{N}) queries for all constant-depth AND-OR trees on N variables, improving upon earlier upper bounds of O(sqrt{N}polylog(N)).

<p>
A continuous-variable tripartite entangled state is experimentally generated by combining three independent squeezed vacuum states and the variances of its relative positions and total momentum are measured. We show that the measured values violate the separability criteria based on the sum of these quantities and prove the full inseparability of the generated state.

<p><strong>8.    Generic Quantum Fourier Transforms</strong><br>
Cristopher Moore, Daniel Rockmore, Alexander Russell<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304064">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304064</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the principal algorithmic tool underlying most efficient quantum algorithms. We present a generic framework for the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the QFT by ``quantizing&#39;&#39; the separation of variables technique that has been so successful in the study of classical Fourier transform computations. Specifically, this framework applies the existence of computable Bratteli diagrams, adapted factorizations, and Gel&#39;fand-Tsetlin bases to offer efficient quantum circuits for the QFT over a wide variety a finite Abelian and non-Abelian groups, including all group families for which efficient QFTs are currently known and many new group families. Moreover, the method gives rise to the first subexponential-size quantum circuits for the QFT over the linear groups GL_k(q), SL_k(q), and the finite groups of Lie type, for any fixed prime power q.

<p><strong>9.    Symplectic evolution of Wigner functions in markovian open systems</strong><br>
O. Brodier, A. M. Ozorio de Almeida<br>
Phys. Rev. E 69, 016204 (2004)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304087">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304087</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Wigner function is known to evolve classically under the exclusive action of a quadratic hamiltonian. If the system does interact with the environment through Lindblad operators that are linear functions of position and momentum, we show that the general evolution is the convolution of the classically evolving Wigner function with a phase space gaussian that broadens in time. We analyze the three generic cases of elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic Hamiltonians. The Wigner function always becomes positive in a definite time, which is shortest in the hyperbolic case. We also derive an exact formula for the evolving linear entropy as the average of a narrowing gaussian taken over a probability distribution that depends only on the initial state. This leads to a long time asymptotic formula for the growth of linear entropy.

<p><strong>11.    Multiparty Quantum Coin Flipping</strong><br>
Andris Ambainis, Harry Buhrman, Yevgeniy Dodis, Hein Roehrig<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304112">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304112</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate coin-flipping protocols for multiple parties in a quantum broadcast setting: (1) We propose and motivate a definition for quantum broadcast. Our model of quantum broadcast channel is new. (2) We discovered that quantum broadcast is essentially a combination of pairwise quantum channels and a classical broadcast channel. This is a somewhat surprising conclusion, but helps us in both our lower and upper bounds. (3) We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal bias epsilon of a coin which can be flipped by k parties of which exactly g parties are honest: for any 1 &lt;= g &lt;= k, epsilon = 1/2 - Theta(g/k). Thus, as long as a constant fraction of the players are honest, they can prevent the coin from being fixed with at least a constant probability. This result stands in sharp contrast with the classical setting, where no non-trivial coin-flipping is possible when g &lt;= k/2.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider asymptotic behaviour of a Hadamard walk on a cycle. For a walk which starts with a state in which all the probability is concentrated on one node, we find the explicit formula for the limiting distribution and discuss its asymptotic behaviour when the length of the cycle tends to infinity. We also demonstrate that for a carefully chosen initial state, the limiting distribution of a quantum walk on cycle can lie further away from the uniform distribution than its initial state.

<blockquote>
<p>
We describe stabilizer states and Clifford group operations using linear operations and quadratic forms over binary vector spaces. We show how the n-qubit Clifford group is isomorphic to a group with an operation that is defined in terms of a (2n+1)x(2n+1) binary matrix product and binary quadratic forms. As an application we give two schemes to efficiently decompose Clifford group operations into one and two-qubit operations. We also show how the coefficients of stabilizer states and Clifford group operations in a standard basis expansion can be described by binary quadratic forms. Our results are useful for quantum error correction, entanglement distillation and possibly quantum computing.

<blockquote>
<p>
Grover&#39;s algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms for unstructured database or library searches. This paper examines the robustness of Grover&#39;s search algorithm to a random phase error in the oracle and analyzes the complexity of the search process as a function of the scaling of the oracle error with database or library size. Both the discrete- and continuous-time implementations of the search algorithm are investigated. It is shown that unless the oracle phase error scales as O(N^(-1/4)), neither the discrete- nor the continuous-time implementation of Grover&#39;s algorithm is scalably robust to this error in the absence of error correction.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304153">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304153</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
A permutationally invariant n-bit code for quantum error correction can be realized as a subspace stabilized by the non-Abelian group S_n. The code corresponds to bases for the trivial representation, and all other irreducible representations, both those of higher dimension and orthogonal bases for the trivial representation, are available for error correction. A number of new (non-additive) binary codes are obtained, including two new 7-bit codes and a large family of new 9-bit codes. It is shown that the degeneracy arising from permutational symmetry facilitates the correction of certain types of two-bit errors. The correction of two-bit errors of the same type is considered in detail, but is shown not to be compatible with single-bit error correction using 9-bit codes.

<p><strong>17.    Sparse Graph Codes for Quantum Error-Correction</strong><br>
David J.C. MacKay, Graeme Mitchison, Paul L. McFadden<br>
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 50, No. 10, p. 2315 (2004).<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304161">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304161</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present sparse graph codes appropriate for use in quantum error-correction. Quantum error-correcting codes based on sparse graphs are of interest for three reasons. First, the best codes currently known for classical channels are based on sparse graphs. Second, sparse graph codes keep the number of quantum interactions associated with the quantum error correction process small: a constant number per quantum bit, independent of the blocklength. Third, sparse graph codes often offer great flexibility with respect to blocklength and rate. We believe some of the codes we present are unsurpassed by previously published quantum error-correcting codes.

Squeezed vacuum states are used as primary entanglement resource, while single-photon sources are not required.

An explicit expression is given for the correlation function of blinking systems, i.e. systems exhibiting light and dark periods in their fluorescence. We show through the example of terrylene in a crystalline host that it is possible to determine by means of this explicit expression photo-physical parameters, like Einstein coefficients and the mean light and dark periods by a simple fit. In addition we obtain further parameters like the frequency of the various intensity periods and the probability density of photons scattered off the host crystal. It turns out that this approach is simpler and allows greater accuracy than previous procedures.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304178">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304178</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a formalism that enables the study of the non-Markovian dynamics of a three-level ladder system in a single structured reservoir. The three-level system is strongly coupled to a bath of reservoir modes and two quantum excitations of the reservoir are expected. We show that the dynamics only depends on reservoir structure functions, which are products of the mode density with the coupling constant squared. This result may enable pseudomode theory to treat multiple excitations of a structured reservoir. The treatment uses Laplace transforms and an elimination of variables to obtain a formal solution. This can be evaluated numerically (with the help of a numerical inverse Laplace transform) and an example is given. We also compare this result with the case where the two transitions are coupled to two separate structured reservoirs (where the example case is also analytically solvable).

We describe a quantum error correction scheme aimed at protecting a flow of quantum information over long distance communication. It is largely inspired by the theory of classical convolutional codes which are used in similar circumstances in classical communication. The particular example shown here uses the stabilizer formalism, which provides an explicit encoding circuit. An associated error estimation algorithm is given explicitly and shown to provide the most likely error over any memoryless quantum channel, while its complexity grows only linearly with the number of encoded qubits.

<blockquote>
<p>
In extension of the bit commitment task and following work initiated by Crepeau and Kilian, we introduce and solve the problem of characterising the optimal rate at which a discrete memoryless channel can be used for bit commitment. It turns out that the answer is very intuitive: it is the maximum equivocation of the channel (after removing trivial redundancy), even when unlimited noiseless bidirectional side communication is allowed. By a well-known reduction, this result provides a lower bound on the channel&#39;s capacity for implementing coin tossing, which we conjecture to be an equality. The method of proving this relates the problem to Wyner&#39;s wire--tap channel in an amusing way. We also discuss extensions to quantum channels.
