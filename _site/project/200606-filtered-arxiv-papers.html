<p>
Transformations achievable by linear optical components allow to generate the whole unitary group only when restricted to the one-photon subspace of a multimode Fock space. In this paper, we address the more general problem of encoding quantum information by multiphoton states, and elaborating it via ancillary extensions, linear optical passive devices and photodetection. Our scheme stems in a natural way from the mathematical structures underlying the physics of linear optical passive devices. In particular, we analyze an economical procedure for mapping a fiducial 2-photon 2-mode state into an arbitrary 2-photon 2-mode state using ancillary resources and linear optical passive N-ports assisted by post-selection. We found that adding a single ancilla mode is enough to generate any desired target state. The effect of imperfect photodetection in post-selection is considered and a simple trade-off between success probability and fidelity is derived.

<p><strong>2.    Decoherence in quantum walks - a review</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
The development of quantum walks in the context of quantum computation, as generalisations of random walk techniques, led rapidly to several new quantum algorithms. These all follow unitary quantum evolution, apart from the final measurement. Since logical qubits in a quantum computer must be protected from decoherence by error correction, there is no need to consider decoherence at the level of algorithms. Nonetheless, enlarging the range of quantum dynamics to include non-unitary evolution provides a wider range of possibilities for tuning the properties of quantum walks. For example, small amounts of decoherence in a quantum walk on the line can produce more uniform spreading (a top-hat distribution), without losing the quantum speed up. This paper reviews the work on decoherence, and more generally on non-unitary evolution, in quantum walks and suggests what future questions might prove interesting to pursue in this area.

<p><strong>3.    Optimum Quantum Error Recovery using Semidefinite Programming</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential element of physical quantum information processing systems. Most QEC efforts focus on extending classical error correction schemes to the quantum regime. The input to a noisy system is embedded in a coded subspace, and error recovery is performed via an operation designed to perfectly correct for a set of errors, presumably a large subset of the physical noise process. In this paper, we examine the choice of recovery operation. Rather than seeking perfect correction on a subset of errors, we seek a recovery operation to maximize the entanglement fidelity for a given input state and noise model. In this way, the recovery operation is optimum for the given encoding and noise process. This optimization is shown to be calculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex optimization with efficient algorithms for its solution. The error recovery operation may also be interpreted as a combining operation following a quantum spreading channel, thus providing a quantum analogy to the classical diversity combining operation.

<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, quantized versions of random walks have been explored as effective elements for quantum algorithms. In the simplest case of one dimension, the theory has remained divided into the discrete-time quantum walk and the continuous-time quantum walk. Though the properties of these two walks have shown similarities, it has remained an open problem to find the exact relation between the two. The precise connection of these two processes, both quantally and classically, is presented. Extension to higher dimensions is also discussed.

<p><strong>5.    Comment on &quot;Optimum Quantum Error Recovery using Semidefinite Programming&quot;</strong><br>
M. Reimpell, R. F. Werner, K. Audenaert<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606059">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606059</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a recent paper ([1]=quant-ph/0606035) it is shown how the optimal recovery operation in an error correction scheme can be considered as a semidefinite program. As a possible future improvement it is noted that still better error correction might be obtained by optimizing the encoding as well. In this note we present the result of such an improvement, specifically for the four-bit correction of an amplitude damping channel considered in [1]. We get a strict improvement for almost all values of the damping parameter. The method (and the computer code) is taken from our earlier study of such correction schemes (quant-ph/0307138).

We describe bichromatic superradiant pump-probe spectroscopy as a tomographic probe of the Wigner function of a dispersing particle beam. We employed this technique to characterize the quantum state of an ultracold atomic beam, derived from a Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensate, as it propagated in a 2.5 mm diameter circular waveguide. Our measurements place an upper bound on the longitudinal phase-space area occupied by the 300,000 atom beam of 9(1) $\hbar$ and a lower bound on the coherence length (L &gt; 13 microns). These results are consistent with full quantum degeneracy after multiple orbits around the waveguide.

We report a narrowing of the interference pattern obtained in an atomic Ramsey interferometer if the two separated fields have different frequency and their phase difference is controlled. The width of the Ramsey fringes depends inversely on the free flight time of ground state atoms before entering the first field region in addition to the time between the fields. The effect is stable also for atomic wavepackets with initial position and momentum distributions and for realistic mode functions.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamics of the entanglement between two qubits coupled to a common chaotic environment, described by the quantum kicked rotator model. We show that the kicked rotator, which is a single-particle deterministic dynamical system, can reproduce the effects of a pure dephasing many-body bath. Indeed, in the semiclassical limit the interaction with the kicked rotator can be described as a random phase-kick, so that decoherence is induced in the two-qubit system. We also show that our model can efficiently simulate non-Markovian environments.

Quant. Inf. Proc. 8, 443 (2009)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606078">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606078</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the problem of designing a quantum information error correcting procedure can be cast as a bi-convex optimization problem, iterating between encoding and recovery, each being a semidefinite program. For a given encoding operator the problem is convex in the recovery operator. For a given method of recovery, the problem is convex in the encoding scheme. This allows us to derive new codes that are locally optimal. We present examples of such codes that can handle errors which are too strong for codes derived by analogy to classical error correction techniques.

<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the state space of bipartite qutrits. For states which are locally maximally mixed we obtain an analog of the <code>magic&#39;&#39; tetrahedron for bipartite qubits--a magic simplex W. This is obtained via the Weyl group which is a kind of</code>quantization&#39;&#39; of classical phase space. We analyze how this simplex W is embedded in the whole state space of two qutrits and discuss symmetries and equivalences inside the simplex W. Because we are explicitly able to construct optimal entanglement witnesses we obtain the border between separable and entangled states. With our method we find also the total area of bound entangled states of the parameter subspace under intervestigation. Our considerations can also be applied to higher dimensions.

We show that the protocol recently proposed by Hosten et al. does not allow all possible results of a computation to be obtained counterfactually, as was claimed. It only gives a counterfactual outcome for one of the computer outputs. However, we confirm the observation that the protocol gives some protection against decoherence. In some situations, though, it may be more effective simply to run the computer several times.

<p><strong>15.    Quantum walks with infinite hitting times</strong><br>
Hari Krovi, Todd A. Brun<br>
Phys. Rev. A 74, 042334 (2006)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606094">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606094</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
Hitting times are the average time it takes a walk to reach a given final vertex from a given starting vertex. The hitting time for a classical random walk on a connected graph will always be finite. We show that, by contrast, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial states. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have infinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition, which for discrete time quantum walks is that the degeneracy of the evolution operator be greater than the degree of the graph. The set of initial states which give an infinite hitting time form a subspace. The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Using the irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions such that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times for some initial states. In the case of the discrete walk, if this condition is satisfied the walk will have infinite hitting times for any choice of a coin operator, and we give a class of graphs with infinite hitting times for any choice of coin. Hitting times are not very well-defined for continuous time quantum walks, but we show that the idea of infinite hitting-time walks naturally extends to the continuous time case as well.

In this paper, we consider a simplified error-correcting problem: for a fixed encoding process, to find a cascade connected quantum channel such that the worst fidelity between the input and the output becomes maximum.

The effectiveness of our method is verified by an example of the bit-flip channel decoding.

<p><strong>17.    Computational approach to quantum encoder design for purity optimization</strong><br>
Naoki Yamamoto, Maryam Fazel<br>
Physical Review A 76, 012327 (2007)<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606106">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606106</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we address the problem of designing a quantum encoder that maximizes the minimum output purity of a given decohering channel, where the minimum is taken over all possible pure inputs. This problem is cast as a max-min optimization problem with a rank constraint on an appropriately defined matrix variable. The problem is computationally very hard because it is non-convex with respect to both the objective function (output purity) and the rank constraint. Despite this difficulty, we provide a tractable computational algorithm that produces the exact optimal solution for codespace of dimension two. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended to cover the general class of codespaces, in which case the solution is suboptimal in the sense that the suboptimized output purity serves as a lower bound of the exact optimal purity. The algorithm consists of a sequence of semidefinite programmings and can be performed easily. Two typical quantum error channels are investigated to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-photon interference is at the heart of the recently proposed linear optical quantum computing scheme and plays an essential role in many protocols in quantum information. Indistinguishability is what leads to the effect of quantum interference. Optical interferometers such as Michaelson interferometer provide a measure for second-order coherence at one-photon level and Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer was widely employed to describe two-photon entanglement and indistinguishability. However, there is not an effective way for a system of more than two photons. Recently, a new interferometric scheme was proposed to quantify the degree of multi-photon distinguishability. Here we report an experiment to implement the scheme for three-photon case. We are able to generate three photons with different degrees of temporal distinguishability and demonstrate how to characterize them by the visibility of three-photon interference. This method of quantitative description of multi-photon indistinguishability will have practical implications in the implementation of quantum information protocols.

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider the problem of optimally decoding a quantum error correction code -- that is to find the optimal recovery procedure given the outcomes of partial &quot;check&quot; measurements on the system. In general, this problem is NP-hard. However, we demonstrate that for concatenated block codes, the optimal decoding can be efficiently computed using a message passing algorithm. We compare the performance of the message passing algorithm to that of the widespread blockwise hard decoding technique. Our Monte Carlo results using the 5 qubit and Steane&#39;s code on a depolarizing channel demonstrate significant advantages of the message passing algorithms in two respects. 1) Optimal decoding increases by as much as 94% the error threshold below which the error correction procedure can be used to reliably send information over a noisy channel. 2) For noise levels below these thresholds, the probability of error after optimal decoding is suppressed at a significantly higher rate, leading to a substantial reduction of the error correction overhead.

<blockquote>
<p>
Many classical randomized algorithms (e.g., approximation algorithms for #P-complete problems) utilize the following random walk algorithm for {\em almost uniform sampling} from a state space $S$ of cardinality $N$: run a symmetric ergodic Markov chain $P$ on $S$ for long enough to obtain a random state from within $\epsilon$ total variation distance of the uniform distribution over $S$. The running time of this algorithm, the so-called {\em mixing time} of $P$, is $O(\delta^{-1} (\log N + \log \epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$. We present a natural quantum version of this algorithm based on repeated measurements of the {\em quantum walk} $U_t = e^{-iPt}$. We show that it samples almost uniformly from $S$ with logarithmic dependence on $\epsilon^{-1}$ just as the classical walk $P$ does; previously, no such quantum walk algorithm was known. We then outline a framework for analyzing its running time and formulate two plausible conjectures which together would imply that it runs in time $O(\delta^{-1/2} \log N \log \epsilon^{-1})$ when $P$ is the standard transition matrix of a constant-degree graph. We prove each conjecture for a subclass of Cayley graphs.

<p>
The exponential speed-up of quantum walks on certain graphs, relative to classical particles diffusing on the same graph, is a striking observation. It has suggested the possibility of new fast quantum algorithms. We point out here that quantum mechanics can also lead, through the phenomenon of localization, to exponential suppression of motion on these graphs (even in the absence of decoherence). In fact, for physical embodiments of graphs, this will be the generic behaviour. It also has implications for proposals for using spin networks, including spin chains, as quantum communication channels.

<p><strong>28.    Scalable Error Correction in Distributed Ion Trap Computers</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>
A major challenge for quantum computation in ion trap systems is scalable integration of error correction and fault tolerance. We analyze a distributed architecture with rapid high fidelity local control within nodes and entangled links between nodes alleviating long-distance transport. We demonstrate fault-tolerant operator measurements which are used for error correction and non-local gates. This scheme is readily applied to linear ion traps which cannot be scaled up beyond a few ions per individual trap but which have access to a probabilistic entanglement mechanism. A proof-of-concept system is presented which is within the reach of current experiment.

<blockquote>
<p>
It was recently proposed to use small groups of trapped ions as qubit carriers in miniaturized electrode arrays that comprise a large number of individual trapping zones, between which ions could be moved. This approach might be scalable for quantum information processing with a large numbers of qubits. Processing of quantum information is achieved by transporting ions to and from separate memory and qubit manipulation zones in between quantum logic operations. The transport of ion groups in this scheme plays a major role and requires precise experimental control and fast transport. In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework to study ion transport in external potentials that might be created by typical miniaturized Paul trap electrode arrays. In particular we discuss the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions of the transport and study the energy transfer to the oscillatory motion during near-adiabatic transport. Based on our findings we suggest a numerical method to find electrode potentials as a function of time to optimize the local potential an ion experiences during transport. We demonstrate this method for one specific electrode geometry that should closely represent the situation encountered in realistic trap arrays.

<p><strong>30.    Investigation of continuous-time quantum walk by using Krylov subspace-Lanczos algorithm</strong><br>
M. A. Jafarizadeh, S. Salimi, R. Sufiani<br>

<blockquote>
<p>
In papers\cite{js,jsa}, the amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on graphs possessing quantum decomposition (QD graphs) have been calculated by a new method based on spectral distribution associated to their adjacency matrix. Here in this paper, it is shown that the continuous-time quantum walk on any arbitrary graph can be investigated by spectral distribution method, simply by using Krylov subspace-Lanczos algorithm to generate orthonormal bases of Hilbert space of quantum walk isomorphic to orthogonal polynomials. Also new type of graphs possessing generalized quantum decomposition have been introduced, where this is achieved simply by relaxing some of the constrains imposed on QD graphs and it is shown that both in QD and GQD graphs, the unit vectors of strata are identical with the orthonormal basis produced by Lanczos algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that probability amplitude of observing walk at a given vertex is proportional to its coefficient in the corresponding unit vector of its stratum, and it can be written in terms of the amplitude of its stratum. Finally the capability of Lanczos-based algorithm for evaluation of walk on arbitrary graphs (GQD or non-QD types), has been tested by calculating the probability amplitudes of quantum walk on some interesting finite (infinite) graph of GQD type and finite (infinite) path graph of non-GQD type, where the asymptotic behavior of the probability amplitudes at infinite limit of number of vertices, are in agreement with those of central limit theorem of Ref.\cite{nko}.

<p><strong>31.    A discrete invitation to quantum filtering and feedback control</strong><br>
Luc Bouten, Ramon van Handel, Matthew R. James<br>
SIAM Review 51, pp. 239-316, 2009<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606118">http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606118</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p>
The engineering and control of devices at the quantum-mechanical level--such as those consisting of small numbers of atoms and photons--is a delicate business. The fundamental uncertainty that is inherently present at this scale manifests itself in the unavoidable presence of noise, making this a novel field of application for stochastic estimation and control theory. In this expository paper we demonstrate estimation and feedback control of quantum mechanical systems in what is essentially a noncommutative version of the binomial model that is popular in mathematical finance. The model is extremely rich and allows a full development of the theory, while remaining completely within the setting of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (thus avoiding the technical complications of the continuous theory). We introduce discretized models of an atom in interaction with the electromagnetic field, obtain filtering equations for photon counting and homodyne detection, and solve a stochastic control problem using dynamic programming and Lyapunov function methods.
