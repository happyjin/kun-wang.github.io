# #  Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is becoming
# #  an increasingly important technique in large-scale problems.
# #  Recently many approaches have been developed due to fast
# #  query and low storage cost. Although most of them have realized
# #  the importance of the data structure, they neglected
# #  the sparse relationship of the data. To build a balance between
# #  the adjusted covariance matrix and the minimum reconstruction
# #  error of data points, this paper proposes a novel
# #  method based on sparse reconstruction to learn more compact
# #  binary codes under l21-norm constraint. Experiments
# #  demonstrate that the proposed method, named as sparse
# #  reconstruction hashing, outperforms several other state-ofthe-
# #  art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.
