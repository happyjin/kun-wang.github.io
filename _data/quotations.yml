  content: Can physics be simulated by a universal computer? ... 
           the physical world is quantum mechanical, and therefore the proper problem 
           is the simulation of quantum physics ... the full description of quantum 
           mechanics for a large system R particles ... has too many variables, 
           it cannot be simulated with a normal computer with a number of elements 
           proportional to R ... but it can be simulated with quantum computer 
           elements. ... Can a quantum system be probabilistically simulated by a classical 
           (probabilistic, I'd assume) universal computer? ... If you take the computer 
           to be the classical kind I've described so far ... 
           the answer is certainly, No!

  content: The theory of computation has traditionally been studied almost entirely 
           in the abstract, as a topic in pure mathematics. 
           This is to miss the point of it. Computers are physical objects, 
           and computations are physical processes. 
           What computers can or cannot compute is determined by the laws 
           of physics alone, and not by pure mathematics.

           Then spies everywhere will all want 'em. <br>
           Our codes will all fall, <br>
           And they'll read our email, <br>
           Till we get crypto that's quantum, and daunt 'em. <br>

           of the spies and their quantum machine; <br>
           be comforted though, <br>
           they do not ye know <br>
           how to factorize twelve or fifteen. <br>
